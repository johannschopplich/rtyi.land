## Game Development Process
- The game "Return to Yoshi's Island" is significantly into development, with Kaze working on "Course 12 out of 15," a Wild West Saloon level.
- Current tasks involve importing and programming new characters and their interactions, such as a "piano playing guy" (a Shy Guy).
- A major recurring challenge is hitting the N64's RAM limits, requiring ongoing optimization of assets like collision maps and 3D models.
- The development process includes integrating assets from collaborators, coding complex behaviors, debugging, performance optimization, and refining gameplay based on iterative testing.
- Kaze is working on a custom, highly optimized engine built upon the Mario 64 decompilation, aiming for high performance (close to 60 FPS on real hardware for some scenes).
- He is using Fast3DX2 for rendering, with a goal to eventually use Fast3DX3.

## Personal Insights
- Kaze considers ROM hacking a "hobby" but dedicates full-time effort to it, alongside his professional career as a programmer on Unreal Engine 5 games.
- He recently had a realization about the importance of "soft skills" (interpersonal communication) and how it changes his perspective on his work.
- Kaze has a highly analytical approach to games, which sometimes leads him to see them as "math formulas," particularly competitive games.
- He expresses a strong desire to create "cool" and "funny" experiences for players, often injecting humor into game mechanics and dialogue.
- His artistic choices can be influenced by personal associations; for instance, he dislikes certain music if it reminds him of negative past experiences (e.g., specific Toad songs).

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: No relevant information found in this transcript regarding contributions to "Return to Yoshi's Island."
- Biobak: No relevant information found in this transcript regarding contributions to "Return to Yoshi's Island."
- Zeina:
    - Provided the 3D model and animations for the "piano playing guy" (Shy Guy) and his piano for the Wild West Saloon level.
    - Kaze integrates Zeina's assets and sometimes fixes or adjusts them. He shows Zeina the progress during the stream.
- Other Contributors:
    - **QED:** Kaze mentions planning to ask QED if they can help rip a "card gun" model from Mario Party 2 for use in the game.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Key Design Choices:**
    - Implementing a "piano playing guy" in a Wild West Saloon who stops playing and interacts with Mario, with the entire bar of NPCs turning to look at Mario if he interrupts.
    - Using directional audio to make the piano music sound like it's coming from the character's location.
    - Planning a "high noon" style duel sequence where Mario uses a "card gun," complete with a 3D modeled countdown.
    - Designing NPC dialogue to fit the Wild West theme (e.g., "translate this into cowboy").
    - Adding Yoshi coins as collectibles, with one planned for "listening to the piano."
- **Obstacles Faced & Solutions:**
    - **RAM Overflow:** A critical and recurring issue. Solutions involve optimizing collision meshes (e.g., reducing triangle count), potentially creating custom collision maps, and being mindful of asset sizes.
    - **Bugs & Glitches:** Debugging various issues, including animation playback problems (e.g., a zero pointer error when checking animation end, animations not looping), crashes due to incorrect object setup (e.g., duplicate geo layouts, exporting temporary objects), and character rotation issues.
    - **NPC Behavior:** Implementing logic for NPCs to react to player actions, such as turning their heads when the piano music stops.
    - **Camera Control:** Setting up specific camera angles and behaviors for cutscenes or special sequences, like the "high noon" duel.
    - **Asset Integration:** Ensuring models and animations from collaborators work correctly within the game engine.

## Business Aspects
- No direct mentions of marketing, funding, or commercial release plans for "Return to Yoshi's Island," as it is a ROM hack.
- Kaze expresses concern about potential leaks of the ROM, indicating a desire to control its distribution and protect the work until he deems it ready for a wider audience or testers. He is selective about who he sends development builds to.
- He distinguishes his ROM hacking work (a "hobby") from his full-time job as a programmer for a game company working on Unreal Engine 5 titles, for which he is under an NDA.

## Key Quotes
- "So our mission today is to import the piano playing guy. Which Zeina has animated and modeled and he's given him a piano too." (Illustrates collaboration and specific development task)
- "it is a ram overflow we're out of memory cool cool all right we have to optimize the fucking level damn didn't think it would happen so soon well actually the level is almost done so it makes sense that we're getting to the end of our ram" (Highlights a major technical challenge and progress)
- "When the piano guy stops the music, the entire bar should look at you. Yeah, exactly. They'd be like, what the fuck, bro? Why'd you stop my jam? I was vibing." (Shows creative game design idea for player interaction and NPC reactivity)
- "romhacks are technically just a hobby but I do work on them full-time so make of that what you will." (Kaze's dedication to the project)

## Potential Interview Topics
