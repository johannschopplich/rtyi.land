## Game Development Process
-   Kaze is actively working on a level for "Return to Yoshi's Island," specifically the "power plant area from the oil level."
-   Current development tasks include programming interactive level elements like platforms (elevators, treadmills), designing the level layout, and implementing enemy behaviors.
-   Significant time is spent on debugging and problem-solving, such as fixing non-functional platforms, addressing overlapping objects, and resolving texture scrolling issues.
-   Optimization is an ongoing concern, with mentions of efforts to improve frame rates (e.g., "We went from 43 to 45 fps to the range of 45 to 49 fps").
-   The process is iterative, involving trying out ideas, testing them, identifying issues, and refining the implementation.
-   Future work planned includes programming specific enemies like "amps" and "oil fuzzies" with unique mechanics.
-   Kaze mentions making "mini optimizations over the week" like inlining functions.

## Personal Insights
-   Kaze expresses a desire for streams to be free of constant release date inquiries: "I hope we can go a whole stream without people asking me for release dates every 15 minutes that would be pretty nice."
-   He reflects on his audience's shift towards more technical viewers: "I feel like a lot of programmers watch my channel now and not so much the casual audience ever since the source code revert."
-   He shows a pragmatic side regarding project selection, weighing passion against potential financial success for smaller projects: "I also don't want to work on hacks that are not gonna be a financial success So we do have to find something topical or something clickbaity like Mario 64 level but good."
-   Kaze has a structured approach to creating his YouTube video content, aiming for engaging narratives: "It's a five-step act first. We hook in the viewer...Then second We're gonna start building tension..."
-   He values the "vibe" of a level and finds it challenging to design without the final textures.

## Collaborator Information
-   **Badub (composer):** No relevant information found in this transcript.
-   **Biobak (graphics artist):**
    -   Expected to provide textures and rework the visuals for the level Kaze is currently working on. Kaze states, "I'm gonna just pick random textures. I'll change them when I rework the level" and "I guess this whole area is gonna be ugly until Biobak gets to it."
    -   Biobak seems to have input on visual elements, as Kaze mentions a discussion about some assets: "What will you replace them with Biobak? Nothing they don't look good. Oh damn."
-   **Zeina (animations):**
    -   Mentioned in a personal context: "yeah Zena is finally out of my hair she is upstairs now and I'm downstairs isn't that nice."
    -   No direct mention of her contributing animations to "Return to Yoshi's Island" in this specific transcript.
-   **Other Contributors (from chat, actively involved in the stream):**
    -   **"Mario" (chat user):** Kaze consults with this user regarding texture choices: "Mario did you end up um picking any textures for this because otherwise I might have to try some more."
    -   **"Lila" (chat user):** Provides significant real-time technical suggestions, helps with debugging, and discusses technical implementation details with Kaze. Kaze frequently addresses Lila's input directly (e.g., "Okay, Lila, I believe you that this feature may work but I don't see how").

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
-   **Level Design & Flow:**
    -   Designing the "power plant" area, focusing on platforming sequences involving elements like an elevator and a fast-moving treadmill. "This is the power plant area from the oil level so if you go inside the whole power generator gonna have to platform through it."
    -   Balancing difficulty and player experience, such as adjusting treadmill speed ("Mario's moving a little fast. I need to slow down a bit") and ensuring platforming sections are clearable but challenging.
    -   Addressing camera issues in tight spaces: "The problem here is that the camera also kind of sucks, right? I don't like that. You can't see Mario."
-   **Enemy Design & Mechanics:**
    -   Conceptualizing an "oil fuzzy" enemy inspired by "Touch fuzzy get dizzy" from Yoshi's Island.
    -   Planned effects for the oil fuzzy include making Mario slippery and uncontrollable, inducing visual distortions (wobbly screen, rainbow oil texture, FOV changes), slowing down audio, and potentially exaggerating Mario's squash and stretch animations.
    -   Planning to include "amp" enemies, possibly with dynamic lighting effects and movement along splines.
-   **Puzzle Elements:**
    -   Designing a Yoshi coin collectible that requires a specific interaction with a moving platform: "Imagine a Yoshi coin like somewhere up here... And the only way to get it would be to pull this platform down and then like hit it something like that."
-   **Technical Implementation Challenges:**
    -   Debugging platform behavior, such as an elevator not moving due to overlapping, identical platforms.
    -   Correcting texture scrolling bugs: "How is there a texture scroll here I literally removed it."
    -   Ensuring performance targets are met while adding new features.
-   **Aesthetics and "Vibe":**
    -   Struggling to define the level's atmosphere without final textures from Biobak: "So that's kind of really difficult for me because I can't really estimate the vibe of this, you know i'm kind of When I design a level I kind of have to go with the vibe."

## Business Aspects
-   **Financial Considerations for Projects:** Kaze mentions that some large projects (like an OOT remaster) would require "decent financial incentive." He also states a preference for smaller, pre-RTYI demo projects to be "a financial success" or at least "topical or something clickbaity."
-   **Pre-Release Demos for RTYI:** Plans to release "one or two more demos" before RTYI. The purpose is "so people can just Play test the physics and stuff." These demos might focus on popular Mario 64 levels, remade.
-   **YouTube Content Strategy:** Kaze consciously thinks about how to structure his videos for viewer engagement, aiming for content that might perform well algorithmically (e.g., "I'm working on a video on the Indra square root I think it might do okay on YouTube").
-   **Professional Work (GFB/Yogscast Games):** Kaze confirms he is "still actively working there" but is under NDA regarding specific projects: "I Am NOT allowed to tell what I am working on."

## Key Quotes
-   "I think we were programming all the platforms here right I just made this one here and now I need to program it this one should be pretty easy to program I think I'll program it as an object just so now she and everything works right off the bat." (Illustrates his object-oriented approach and iterative building).
-   "Honestly before our tyi's release. I do want to release one or two more demos where people can just Play test the physics and stuff... But I also don't want to work on hacks that are not gonna be a financial success So we do have to find something topical or something clickbaity." (Highlights the dual purpose of demos and his business-minded approach to smaller projects).
-   "Touch fuzzy get dizzy. Oh They should make Marsh super slippery so you can't stop yes, I like that... The weird Effect happens should you take damage to a Lot of squash and stretch... Mario's squash and stretch effects becomes 5x strong... Also increase the strength of the rainbow effect on the oil That will look wild." (Shows the creative brainstorming process for unique enemy mechanics in RTYI).
