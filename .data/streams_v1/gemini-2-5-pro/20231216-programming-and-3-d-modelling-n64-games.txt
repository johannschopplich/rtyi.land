## Game Development Process
-   The stream focuses on "Course 12," the cowboy-themed level for "Return to Yoshi's Island."
-   Current stage involves art style testing, particularly for buildings, colors, textures, skybox, and fog.
-   A clear development timeline is outlined: 1. Settle on building style, 2. Draw overhead map, 3. Make a blockout, 4. Make the level look decent.
-   Kaze mentions development has slowed since Course 9 due to him having a full-time job.
-   He uses a toolchain involving Blender with the Fast64 plugin to export levels into the Mario 64 decompilation.
-   The process is iterative, with Kaze experimenting with different visual elements live and reacting to chat feedback.
-   Significant progress is implied by reaching Course 12.
-   Level layout planning is done using MS Paint after initial art style exploration.

## Personal Insights
-   Kaze gets into the "cowboy mood" for designing the level, even wearing a cowboy hat.
-   He expresses a strong desire for the level to have a "goofy, funny cowboy town" vibe, not "dark, gritty" or "monocolored."
-   He coined the term "cowboyaboo" to describe his approach: an exaggerated, stereotypical, and enthusiastic take on cowboy culture, similar to "weeaboo" for Japanese culture.
-   Kaze acknowledges that "finding the art style always takes a while" and is a challenging part of development.
-   He states, "I would never reference something that I don't enjoy," indicating a personal curation of inspirations.
-   He shows frustration with elements that don't work ("This building style is just not exciting me," "Why does it look so shitty when compared to the concept art?") but remains persistent.
-   He has strong opinions on game design, e.g., disliking puzzle elements requiring item carrying in Mario games.

## Collaborator Information
-   **Badub (Badub):**
    -   Composer for the game.
    -   Sent Kaze a song specifically for the cowboy level during the stream.
    -   Kaze's reaction: "Oh, this is so good. Yo. Oh, that's so perfect. I love this... I'm assuming he made this for this level."
    -   The music influenced Kaze's thoughts on the level's atmosphere, suggesting the need for fog.
-   **Biobak:**
    -   An active participant in the stream chat, providing suggestions and feedback, particularly on visual style.
    -   Kaze directly engages with Biobak's suggestions, e.g., "Uh, but giving it the most charitable possible interpretation, I think what you're saying is to make them more saturated. Is that correct?"
    -   At one point, Kaze humorously notes a suggestion made him "look like an asshole" when trying to find buildings Biobak referenced.
-   **Zeina (Zayna):**
    -   Mentioned peripherally: "Zayna just came home with a new house. I can hear her talking to someone."
    -   No specific contributions to the cowboy level or "Return to Yoshi's Island" are detailed in this transcript excerpt, beyond her presence in Kaze's life.
-   **Other Contributors:**
    -   **Feelers of Music:** Suggested a "Nintendo Country, Western Edition" video.
    -   **Shine:** Mentioned in the context of a past collaboration ("Universal Conservation") where Kaze contributed minimally by providing coordinates for metal boxes. Not directly related to "Return to Yoshi's Island" development.
    -   Numerous chat members provide suggestions and feedback, acting as an informal sounding board.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
-   **Level Theme & Concept:** A "goofy, funny" cowboy town surrounded by canyons and mountains, with a "cowboyaboo" aesthetic.
-   **Key Features Planned:**
    -   Two train stations with a functional train for travel between areas.
    -   Saloon (serving only milk, with NPCs having humorous dialogue inspired by "Cowboy Cats" Instagram).
    -   Sheriff's office and jail (central to the outlaw-catching theme).
    -   Three small bosses, each yielding a star (a Snuffit outlaw, a bank-robbing Monty Mole, and five Goombas in a trench coat).
    -   Other elements: cowboy hat shop, bank (Koopa shell bank), tumbleweeds, giant cactuses, barrels, fences, dead trees, wanted posters, rocking chairs, wooden windmill.
    -   Enemies: Shy Guys, Snuffits with guns, Cowboy Goombas, Pokies, Bandits (from Yoshi's Island), Dry Bones, Monty Moles.
    -   NPCs: Friendly Yoshi Cowboys (Yoshis as "taxi people"/horses), Cowboy Toads.
-   **Art Style Challenges:**
    -   Major focus of the stream: finding the right art style for buildings, avoiding a "monocolor" or "boring" look while fitting the N64's capabilities.
    -   Experiments with colors, saturation, textures (wood types), building shapes (slanted vs. straight walls), and overall color palette.
    -   The addition of a skybox and fog significantly changed the perceived vibe and helped solidify the direction.
    -   Inspiration drawn from various sources: Yoshi Valley, Western Land (Mario Party), Kali Mari Desert, Wario's Gold Mine, Twilight Princess (Hidden Village, Ordon Village), Cowboy Cats Instagram, AI-generated concept art, but Kaze is careful to adapt them to his vision.
-   **Level Structure:**
    -   Planned three main areas: Town area, Valley area, Train Headquarters.
    -   The town area is designed with a central mountain feature (initially a tunnel, later revised) to aid N64 culling and provide a circular path.
    -   Train tracks planned at ground level and elevated ("sky train tracks").
-   **Mission Design:**
    -   First star: Secret room in the saloon, shootout with a Snuffit.
    -   Second star: Monty Mole bank robbery, follow a trail to a boss fight.
    -   Third star: Train robbery by five Goombas in a trench coat; player must topple them and fight them.

## Business Aspects
-   Kaze Emanuar multi-streams to Twitch and YouTube simultaneously.
-   Donations and subscription alerts are set up on stream ("We got donations set up again, we got rewards set up").
-   He mentions Nintendo took down his tutorials in the past: "Nintendo took all my tutorials down." This implies a history that might affect his distribution or content creation choices, though not directly discussed for RTYI's release.
-   No specific marketing campaigns, detailed release plans, or distribution strategies for "Return to Yoshi's Island" are discussed in this transcript.

## Key Quotes
-   "I want it to be that, but for cowboys... So, a cowboyaboo. Yes, I will be a cowboyaboo with this one." (Describing his unique vision for the cowboy level's aesthetic and tone.)
-   "Finding the art style always takes a while... This is supposed to be like a goofy, funny cowboy town. Not dark, gritty." (Highlighting the iterative and challenging nature of art style development and his desired atmosphere.)
-   "This is our timeline. One, settle on a style for buildings. Two, draw a little overhead map of what we want the level to look like. Three, make a block out of the level. Four, make the level look decent." (Outlining his structured approach to level development.)

## Potential Interview Topics
-   **The "Cowboyaboo" Vision:** Explore the origins and specifics of the "cowboyaboo" concept for the level. How does this philosophy guide his design choices in terms of gameplay, enemy design, and narrative beyond just the visual style?
-   **Iterative Art and Community Feedback:** Discuss Kaze's process for developing a level's visual identity, the specific challenges faced with the cowboy level's art style, and how he incorporates or filters feedback from the live stream chat.
-   **Balancing Ambition with N64 Limitations:** Delve into how Kaze approaches designing complex features (like the dynamic train system, multiple bosses, detailed environments) while working within the N64's technical constraints.
-   **Collaboration and Inspiration:** Elaborate on the collaborative process with contributors like Badub (music) and how external inspirations (games, art, internet culture like Cowboy Cats) are synthesized into the game's unique identity.
-   **Project Evolution and Personal Drive:** Since "Return to Yoshi's Island" is a long-term project (Course 12), inquire about how the overall vision for the game has evolved, what keeps him motivated (especially with a full-time job), and what he hopes players will experience.
