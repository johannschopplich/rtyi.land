## Game Development Process
- The project is in a content integration phase, where new art assets are being imported into a recently upgraded game engine.
- Kaze's workflow involves tackling programming-heavy tasks off-stream, while using streams for asset importation, bug-fixing, and more visual development.
- A major technical milestone, the completion of the core engine upgrade, is near. This is expected to increase stability and reduce the frequency of bugs.
- The development plan appears to be structured around completing levels one by one, with work on the main overworld happening between level development stages.
- The process is highly iterative, frequently involving importing an asset, discovering bugs (visual, collision, or animation-related), debugging the issue live, and re-importing.
- A significant portion of development time is dedicated to bug-fixing, particularly issues arising from the new engine and its interaction with assets. Kaze maintains a detailed bug list for each level.

## Personal Insights
- Kaze holds a strong design philosophy that player movement should be entirely predictable and consistent, free from the "randomness" caused by the original Mario 64 engine's sub-frame inaccuracies.
- He is driven to create a more polished and accessible experience, aiming to remove esoteric mechanics (like quarter-frame precision) that confuse the average player.
- He expresses immense pride in his technical accomplishments, particularly the complete rewrite of the game's collision engine to achieve his goal of consistent movement.
- He reflects on his own skill set, noting that he finds the technical/programming aspects of development easier than the artistic side.
- He views the development process itself as a source of content for his YouTube channel, often considering whether a specific technical challenge or design discussion would make for an interesting video.

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub:** No relevant information found in this transcript.
- **Biobak (Graphics Artist):** The primary 3D artist for the project. He provides updated models and textures (e.g., Poochie, various level assets). The collaboration is active and happens in real-time, with Kaze reading Biobak's notes and implementing his assets during the stream. Their work involves creative compromises, such as Kaze developing a complex, real-time shading solution to accommodate Biobak's desire for detailed vertex colors on a rotating apple model.
- **Zeina (Animator/Modeler):** Mentioned as a previous contributor whose models (e.g., a Shy Guy) are now being updated and reworked by Biobak.
- **Other Contributors:** An unnamed female collaborator ("she") is mentioned as having created a new thumbnail for an F3 (Fan-game Festival) presentation.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Custom Collision Engine:** The most significant design decision is the implementation of a new collision system. This was done to eliminate the unpredictable nature of movement on slopes in the original game, ensuring the player character consistently sticks to surfaces rather than randomly flying off.
- **RAM Management:** A recurring and critical challenge is managing the N64's limited RAM. The team is running close to the limit, requiring clever optimization. Kaze resolved a memory crash during the stream by reallocating certain assets to a secondary "emergency memory pool" to prevent fragmentation of the main pool.
- **Reconciling Art and Tech:** A core challenge is making modern, detailed assets work within the N64's technical constraints. This includes dealing with transparency rendering order, material/texture formats, and finding ways to implement dynamic lighting on objects that use vertex colors (which normally precludes it).
- **Potential for Multiplayer:** Kaze mentions a plan to potentially add split-screen multiplayer, which would introduce new technical considerations for memory and rendering (e.g., smaller frame buffers).
- **Jukebox Feature:** A "banger idea" is floated to have collectibles in the world that unlock music tracks in a jukebox, showing a focus on rewarding exploration.

## Business Aspects
- **Merchandising:** Kaze mentions his TeePublic merchandise store and an issue with it being linked to his YouTube channel, indicating a commercial aspect to his content creation.
- **Marketing & Presentation:** There is active thought put into marketing, such as designing a thumbnail for the F3 fan game event to clearly communicate what the project is about.
- **Content Creation:** The development process is a key driver for Kaze's YouTube channel. He explicitly discusses turning technical explanations, like the quirks of Mario 64's collision, into video content to engage his audience and grow his brand.

## Key Quotes
- "I feel like there never should be any randomness in Mario's movement... I want to remove quarter frame precision from the player's mind. Like, I don't want the player to think about their quarter frames when they play my game." - *Summarizes his core design philosophy for the game's feel.*
- "Case why. Because Biobak wants his vertex colors on the apple, and I want my shadows on the apple. So we compromise by computing the fucking shadows on the CPU in real time." - *Perfectly encapsulates the collaborative and problem-solving dynamic between the project's lead programmer and artist.*
- "I was fixing like three different bugs I had... When I run into collision bugs, I have to set up like a coordinate perfect thing that I can consistently do... That was a really annoying bug." - *Highlights the methodical and often frustrating nature of bug-fixing in a complex physics-based game.*

## Potential Interview Topics
- **The "No Randomness" Philosophy:** Explore the origins of Kaze's core design principle. How does creating a perfectly consistent movement system change the game for both casual players and hardcore speedrunners?
- **Collaboration and Creative Compromise:** Delve into the working relationship with Biobak. Use the "apple shading" problem as a case study to discuss how artistic vision pushes technical innovation on the project.
- **Wrestling with the N64:** Discuss the N64 as both a platform and an obstacle. What are the most significant technical limitations he has had to overcome, and how has that challenge shaped the final game and his skills as a developer?
- **Development as Performance:** Explore the experience of developing a game live on stream. How does the presence of an audience influence his problem-solving process and design decisions?
- **Innovation vs. Homage:** As this is a ROM hack of a beloved classic, ask about his process for deciding what to "fix" versus what to preserve. What elements of the original Mario 64 does he believe are perfect and shouldn't be touched?
