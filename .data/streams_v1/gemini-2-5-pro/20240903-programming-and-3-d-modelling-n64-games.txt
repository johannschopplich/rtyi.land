## Game Development Process
- Currently UV mapping and texturing Course 13, a large castle level. Platforming for this level is mostly complete.
- Successfully integrated FBDX3, a new microcode by Sauron, leading to significant performance improvements (around 50 FPS, aiming for stable 60 FPS).
- Identified that the RSP (Reality Signal Processor) is now the primary performance bottleneck, not memory traffic, especially with optimized games using FBDX3.
- Planning a demo for "Course 1" to showcase new camera and Mario controls.
- Actively working on optimizing draw distances and considering per-area draw distance.
- A separate Banjo-Kazooie project (porting levels into his engine) has 120 stars finished, demonstrating engine capabilities.

## Personal Insights
- Kaze is often self-critical of his work-in-progress visuals, calling early textures "dog shit" or "hideous," but is focused on achieving a specific vision.
- His design philosophy for visuals is primarily about evoking emotions in the player (e.g., "cold and mysterious" for the current ice/castle level).
- He acknowledges when the art direction feels "boring" or is "missing the secret sauce" and iterates on it.
- Kaze expresses a desire to create more YouTube content to increase his income, especially with new family responsibilities, even if it means he might have to "sell out a little bit."
- He believes in learning programming fundamentals deeply, suggesting MIPS Assembly as a starting point before C.

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: No direct mention of "Badub" by name in this transcript. Music selection was discussed with a choice of "Marker the SOST," which could potentially be Badub or another composer.
- Biobak: A graphics artist who Kaze relies on to significantly improve and finalize the visual aspects of levels. Kaze states, "Really at this point I have resigned myself to like knowing that whatever I do is just kind of like a suggestion for Biobak and he's gonna make it look a lot better."
- Zeina: Working on assets for the outside area of the current level. Kaze also mentions Zeina will be cutting his hair.
- Other Contributors:
    - Sauron: Creator of the FBDX3 microcode, which has been crucial for performance improvements.
    - Marker: Mentioned as the composer for "Marker the SOST" (Super Ominous Synth Track, presumably) chosen for the stream.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Visuals & Atmosphere:** Striving for a "cold and mysterious" feel for the current ice-themed castle level (Course 13). Experimenting with textures and colors (e.g., blue, teal) to achieve this.
- **Performance Optimization:** Constant challenge. Migrating to FBDX3 improved FPS but revealed RSP as the new bottleneck. Techniques like "room doors" are used for culling to manage rendering loads.
- **Technical Bugs:** Encountered an issue with ambient light disappearing near additional light sources ("I couldn't figure it out at all"). Also, a temporary issue with running out of memory for collision triangles, to be solved with a collision map.
- **Level Structure:** Course 13 is designed as a large, labyrinthine castle with multiple paths and secret areas (e.g., a secret pipe leading to a Yoshi coin).
- **Player Experience:** Considering how to make level transitions (e.g., castle to cave) more visually obvious. Aware of diverse player feedback regarding difficulty.
- **Asset Creation:** Dealing with issues like stretched textures which will be automated later. Working on textures for walls, floors, and environmental elements.

## Business Aspects
- Kaze plans to increase his YouTube video output to generate more income due to personal financial needs (having a child).
- He is considering releasing a demo of "Course 1" to allow players to experience new mechanics.
- He humorously discusses YouTube trends and the idea of creating drama for views, indicating an awareness of platform dynamics for visibility, though he states he doesn't want to be a "drama YouTuber."

## Key Quotes
- "For me, I think about it in first line about like emotions I want to invoke in the player. And I want this to feel cold and mysterious." (On visual design philosophy)
- "we got FBDX3 working correctly now... And yes, Leela, I now use material bleeding. I'm not sure if you can see it, but it's basically like 50 FPS now." (On technical progress and performance)
- "Okay, we have an issue in this level. And that is we are running out of memory for collision triangles... It's only temporary because as soon as we make a collision map, that issue will go away." (On development challenges and solutions)
- "I'm actually going to be trying to make a lot more money soon, which means like I make a lot more videos because now that I have a child, I need to make more money." (On personal motivations affecting content creation)

## Potential Interview Topics
- **The Shift to RSP Bottleneck:** Explore the technical journey of optimizing for the N64, the impact of FBDX3, and how discovering the RSP as the new bottleneck has changed his development approach for "Return to Yoshi's Island."
- **Collaborative Dynamics:** Delve deeper into the creative workflow with key collaborators like Biobak (visuals) and Zeina (assets), and how their contributions shape the final game. Ask about the process with the composer (Marker/Badub).
- **Artistic Vision vs. Technical Constraints:** Discuss how Kaze balances his desire to evoke specific emotions and create complex levels with the inherent limitations of the N64 hardware, including specific examples like the collision memory issue or lighting bugs.
- **"Return to Yoshi's Island" - Core Concept and Innovations:** What are the core ideas Kaze wants to bring to life with this ROM hack? What specific gameplay mechanics (new camera, Mario controls) or design philosophies distinguish it from other Mario 64 projects?
- **The Role of Community and Streaming:** How does live streaming development and interacting with the community influence the game's direction, problem-solving, or Kaze's motivation?
