## Game Development Process
-   The project is in its "final stretch," with a primary focus on completing the large-scale overworld that connects the game's levels.
-   15 courses are considered finished, indicating the bulk of the level design is complete.
-   The team is currently doing a "first art pass" on the overworld, suggesting an iterative approach to development where assets and design are refined over time.
-   The game is described as "gigantic," approximately four times the size of the original Super Mario 64, and is being developed to run on original N64 hardware.
-   Key recent fixes include resolving a major audio crackling bug and implementing a new custom microcode to improve graphical precision.

## Personal Insights
-   Kaze expresses a philosophy that "Developing video games is suffering," framing it as a difficult but meaningful and deliberate life choice compared to passive entertainment.
-   He identifies the project's ambition, particularly features like "character attractions," as the primary reason for the extended development timeline.
-   There's a sense of burnout with the base engine's limitations, as he states, "I think I just cannot play Mario 64 hacks anymore," citing frustrations with "vanilla Mario 64 stuff" that remains in the hack.
-   He actively seeks to create "unique video games" and new experiences, which is a core motivation for the project's ambitious design.

## Collaborator Information
-   **Badub:** No relevant information found.
-   **Biobak:** Mentioned as a graphics artist who has worked on level assets. Kaze specifically credits them with potentially re-texturing a pirate ship sail to make it look "a lot more pirate-y."
-   **Zeina:** Mentioned as "Zeina," who appears to be Kaze's wife. No specific contributions to the game are mentioned in this transcript.
-   **Other Contributors:**
    -   **Soren:** A crucial technical contributor who developed "F3DX3," a custom microcode that increases graphical precision eightfold without a performance cost. He also provides direct feedback on levels.
    -   **Fnatic:** A team member Kaze needs to communicate with regarding game crashes, suggesting they have a role in debugging or level implementation.
    -   **Zeno:** The artist responsible for Kaze's "Yoshi with the sunglasses" profile picture.
    -   **Lachmelot:** Mentioned as a "famous" acquaintance with whom Kaze has "secret conversations," though their direct involvement in the project is not specified.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
-   **Challenge: RAM Limitation:** The N64's 8MB of RAM is a significant constraint. This forced the team to cut content, such as a "comet and the UFO platform," to free up memory in a specific level.
-   **Decision: Emphasis on Audio:** Kaze is intentionally focusing on adding detailed ambient sound effects (e.g., elevator sounds, rollercoaster noise, character sounds) to make the levels feel more immersive and alive.
-   **Challenge: Scope Management:** The project's massive scope leads to oversights. Kaze realizes during the stream that the Wing Cap level was completely forgotten and must be integrated into the overworld plan.
-   **Decision: Iterative World Design:** The overworld layout, particularly the "shipyard" area, is being actively designed and resized on stream to improve gameplay flow and visual composition, demonstrating a fluid and iterative design process.
-   **Challenge: Technical Hurdles:** The team constantly battles technical issues, including emulator-specific crashes, Z-buffer precision artifacts (z-fighting), and game-breaking bugs that require investigation and specific fixes like asset removal.

## Business Aspects
-   Kaze mentions he was "in talk with a merch company today," indicating an exploration of merchandising his brand, though no concrete plans are confirmed.

## Key Quotes
-   "Developing video games is suffering. The Buddhists had it right when they said that life is suffering. Because what do you do if you're not suffering? Scrolling TikTok reels?" - Provides insight into Kaze's personal philosophy on creative work.
-   "we finished 15 courses now and now we're just finishing the overworld So we are like the final stretch It is a gigantic game probably four times the size of the original and it all runs on real hardware so" - Succinctly summarizes the project's current status, massive scale, and technical goal.
-   "we got an upgrade to F3DX3. Which is like a custom microcode that Soren is working on. And... That has increased the precision eightfold, if I remember correctly. Without any cost." - Highlights the deep technical innovation and collaborative effort required to push the boundaries of the N64 engine.

## Potential Interview Topics
1.  **The "Suffering" and the Passion:** Explore the duality of Kaze's "development is suffering" philosophy. What specific moments of frustration stand out, and what moments of triumph or satisfaction make the long, difficult process worthwhile?
2.  **Pushing the N64's Limits:** A deep dive into the technical collaboration with Soren. How did the need for the F3DX3 microcode arise, and what new design possibilities did it unlock for the team that wouldn't be possible in a standard ROM hack?
3.  **The Overworld as a Character:** Discuss the design philosophy behind creating such a massive overworld. How do you balance scale with meaningful gameplay and prevent it from feeling empty, and what challenges arise when trying to connect 15 distinct courses?
4.  **The Art of the Cut:** Explore the decision to remove assets like the comet and UFO. How does the team decide what gets cut, and how do they weigh creative vision against hard technical limitations like the N64's RAM?
5.  **Managing Creative Chaos:** The "Wing Cap" oversight is a perfect example of the unpredictable nature of large projects. How does the team handle these moments of discovery, and how does the overall vision for the game evolve and adapt during development?
