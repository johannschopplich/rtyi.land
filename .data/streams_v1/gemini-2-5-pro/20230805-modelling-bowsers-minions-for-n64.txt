## Game Development Process
-   **RTYI Engine Development:** Kaze is actively refining an engine (referred to as "RTYI engine") based on the Mario 64 decompilation. He plans to release "one or two more hacks on the RTYI engine before RTYI is released just to like get everything a little bit improved."
-   **Iterative Improvement:** Kaze uses playtest data from other projects (e.g., "Only Up 64") to inform improvements for the RTYI engine.
-   **Current Focus:** Work during the stream includes improving physics, camera, ceiling interactions, redesigning warps, developing NPC behaviors (Wiggler overseer, Koopa with cement), and implementing visual effects (cement dirtiness).
-   **Code Quality:** Kaze is making efforts to improve code readability and maintainability by converting magic numbers to defines with comments, inspired by practices from other projects.
-   **Testing:** Kaze primarily tests on emulators and only tests on N64 hardware when making performance-specific changes.
-   **Tooling:** Kaze uses Blender with the "Fast64" plugin for modeling, animation, and exporting assets.

## Personal Insights
-   **On Game Feel:** Kaze is very focused on game feel, discussing input lag (60fps vs 30fps), physics interactions (slope jumps, ceiling bonks), and warp transitions, aiming for improvements over or different from vanilla SM64.
-   **On Vanilla SM64:** He acknowledges a "rose tinting with vanilla Mario 64 collision" and believes some oddities players attribute to his hacks are actually present in the original game.
-   **On Player Experience:** Kaze considers how his own expertise might make him overlook difficulties casual players could face: "Actually, by being bad at Mario 64, you have better chances of making a good attack. Because if you're good at Mario 64, there's going to be many random things in your game that you won't notice that casual players will have huge problems with."
-   **On SM64 Hacking Trends:** He comments on a past trend in SM64 hacking (around 2013-2015) where creators boasted about high polygon counts as a measure of detail, which he found inefficient.
-   **Self-Assessment:** "I think I'm very good at what I'm doing but there are definitely people out there that know more about how to fuck with the n64 than me I just happen to be very good like Mario 64 and that optimization I think I'm the best optimization guy but just general and 64 nope that ain't me."

## Collaborator Information
-   **Badub:** No direct interaction in this transcript. His music ("OST") for "Only Up 64" (which uses the RTYI engine) is mentioned, and Kaze plays a new version of a track, implying Badub is likely involved with music for projects using this engine, possibly RTYI itself.
-   **Biobak (Graphics Artist):** Kaze mentions, "I can help you with some models since I'm a little more confident in my skills now," and Kaze later considers asking Biobak to "find a friend of mine model a jacket." Biobak also makes a suggestion for Wiggler's standing pose ("Is this what Biobak meant?").
-   **Zeina (Animations):** Actively collaborates with Kaze during the stream.
    -   Kaze assigns Zeina tasks like creating a penguin's idle animation ("that's your first task for the day then").
    -   Kaze requests a "sobbing animation" for a Koopa NPC from Zeina and sends her an updated Koopa model.
    -   Zeina sends Kaze an animation for the Koopa crying, which Kaze reviews and provides feedback on live.
-   **Other Contributors:**
    -   **Cozy:** Credited with writing a "fast 64 script" (Blender plugin functionality).
    -   **Marbler:** Kaze mentions taking notes from "how we work in years for breakfast," implying learning from collaborative experiences with Marbler on those projects.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
-   **Wiggler Overseer NPC:** A major design element discussed is a Wiggler character who acts as an "overseer" on an oil rig. The Wiggler will react with increasing anger (visual changes like turning red, puffing smoke, new animations) as the player "ruins the day" of various worker NPCs. Eventually, the Wiggler will give up and leave.
-   **Cement Ruining Easter Egg:** Kaze implements a feature where a Koopa NPC is building with cement, and the player can ruin it by walking on it. If the player makes "almost the entire area black," an Easter egg triggers where the Koopa starts crying and has new dialogue ("Do you want to make me cry?").
    -   **Challenge:** Optimizing the detection of "dirtiness" on the cement texture to avoid iterating through all 16,384 texels. Kaze devises an approximation method that checks a subset of pixels.
-   **Warp Redesign:** Kaze is unhappy with the current warp transition ("it just does that") and plans to change it so player inputs are held, and Mario's normal actions continue during the warp, aiming for a smoother 60fps experience.
-   **Physics and Collision:** Adjustments to ceiling interactions (bonking instead of getting stuck). Discussion about slope jumps and how they are a vanilla SM64 mechanic that players sometimes misunderstand in hacks.
-   **Model Complexity:** Kaze encounters a Wiggler model from R64DS with "way too many triangles" and discusses methods like the decimate modifier or simplifying parts (e.g., feet). He generally prefers efficient models.
-   **Input Lag:** Kaze discusses player perceptions of input lag, attributing some of it to lower framerates (30fps on N64) or the transition from 60fps to 30fps, rather than inherent issues in his game. He states 60fps "significantly reduces the input lag."

## Business Aspects
-   **Streaming Platform Change:** Kaze switched from Twitch to YouTube for streaming, citing "too many ads" on Twitch making it unenjoyable.
-   **Monetization:** Kaze notes receiving "real super chat donations on YouTube" for the first time. He briefly considers subscribing to Twitter Blue to potentially monetize his tweets but is hesitant due to the requirements and image.
-   **Pre-Release Strategy:** The plan to "make like one or two more hacks on the RTYI engine before RTYI is released" could be seen as a way to test the engine, gather feedback, and build anticipation for the main RTYI project.

## Key Quotes
-   "I have made some changes since last time only up 64 was really really useful playtest data and I'm gonna use the playtest data to prove RTYI we should make like one or two more hacks on the RTYI engine before RTYI is released just to like get everything a little bit improved." (Highlights iterative development and engine strategy)
-   "so we have this oil rig here and the wiggler is gonna be right here he's the overseer... and then you go and you like go to the Koopas and you fucking break their heart and there's a little bit of a cutscene of the wiggler doing like an angry animation and going slightly red..." (Describes a key NPC interaction and game design concept)
-   "I took notes from how we work in years for breakfast and I decided I will make all the magic numbers into defines in this file and I even added comic comments that follow some sort of code guidelines so now we have all the defines for like Mars physics and the camera even and they're super easy to modify." (Shows commitment to improving development practices)
