## Game Development Process
- **Current Focus:** Intensive work on specific levels, particularly "Course 1" and a significant rework of "Oily Boily Bay" (referred to as "Course 11" at one point) by collaborator Biobak. This includes visual overhauls, lighting, texture work, and geometry adjustments.
- **Iterative Development:** The process is highly iterative. Kaze mentions "completely reworking this area here with the boss" and going through Biobak's detailed changelog for Oily Boily Bay, discussing and implementing changes one by one.
- **Demo Strategy:** A key upcoming milestone is a new demo focusing on "Course 1." The primary goal of this demo is "to get Feedback on the physics and the camera" to "help us make the game more fun." This demo will be used to gather "a lot of playtest data."
- **Engine/Physics Refinement:** Continuous work on Mario's movement, physics, and camera. Kaze expresses satisfaction with the current feel: "Dude, the movement in this game feels so good to me now."
- **Timeline:** Kaze states the game "probably not" will be finished this year (referring to the current year of the stream).
- **Tooling:** Heavy reliance on Blender and Fast64 for ROM hacking, with Kaze troubleshooting issues with Blender versions and presets during the stream.

## Personal Insights
- **Strong Opinions & Vision:** Kaze has very clear and strong opinions on game design, tools, and even broader concepts like color theory ("I hate it. It was just like random stuff someone made up") and humility ("acting humble is a coward's tactic"). He has a distinct vision for the game and is not afraid to express his views directly.
- **Hands-on Approach:** Kaze is deeply involved in all aspects, from integrating assets to fixing minor visual details and even considering doing animations himself ("I'm making it so in the open hand model for Mario is used in my animations").
- **Focus on "Game Feel":** A high priority is placed on how the game feels to play, particularly Mario's movement and camera. He mentions, "Dude, the movement in this game feels so good to me now. It's so fun to just move around."
- **Confidence in Abilities:** Kaze shows confidence in his decision-making: "I Genuinely believe me making every single decision ever is better than democracy for everyone involved, especially me."
- **Passion for the Project:** His extended discussions, detailed analysis of Biobak's work, and enthusiasm for new mechanics ("You guys want to see another cool mechanic I added today?") demonstrate a deep passion for "Return to Yoshi's Island."

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub (Composer):** No direct mention of Badub or their specific contributions in this transcript. Kaze does mention, "If the summary doesn't have its own unique music it should use one of my noobs bonus tracks," which could potentially refer to Badub's work, but it's not explicit.
- **Biobak (Graphics Artist - referred to as "Biobak"):**
    - **Major Contributor:** Biobak is a key collaborator responsible for significant graphical overhauls and level remakes, most notably "Oily Boily Bay" (also referred to as Oily Boily Day). The stream features an extensive, detailed review of Biobak's changelog and model for this level.
    - **Contributions:** Includes updating lighting, geometry, textures, designing new assets (containers, fan design, Bowser tower, electrical elements, drilling machines, cranes, underwater areas, factory section, boss arena), and optimizing polycounts. Biobak also provides notes and suggestions for implementation (e.g., "Underwater area the first note on the underwater area says just fucking look at it").
    - **Interaction:** Kaze and Biobak have a close working relationship involving detailed feedback and iteration. Kaze goes through Biobak's work meticulously, discussing changes, potential issues, and implementation details. Example: "Okay, as usual, we're gonna go over the changelog one by one And make sure every single change is fine in one way or the other."
- **Zeina (Animations):** No direct mention of Zeina or their specific animation contributions in this transcript. Kaze mentions working with Mario's animations himself: "I'm making it so in the open hand model for Mario is used in my animations".

- **Other Contributors:**
    - **Lila (Chat User):** Provides technical advice and suggestions during the stream, particularly regarding Blender presets and Fast64. ("Look for your old ones you could have just copied them from your old blender version. No, that's what I tried to do Lila, but I couldn't find them.")
    - **Dan (Mentioned by Kaze):** Suggested a technique for grass textures: "Dan suggested this. You have the same grass texture twice and you overlay it on top of each other."
    - **Unnamed "Clips show" viewer:** Pointed out an art style inconsistency with Koopa billboards.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **New Mechanics:** Implementation of a new jump mechanic: "if you hold the A button... You jump higher. And you regain some control of Mario. Kinda like how the old Mario games work."
- **Level Design Philosophy:** Focus on creating visually interesting and cohesive environments, with attention to lighting ("just having some lighting in here already changes a lot"), mood ("The vibe is cool though"), and gameplay flow. Extensive rework of Oily Boily Bay by Biobak to enhance its visual appeal and thematic consistency (e.g., "sexy brutalist architecture" for Bowser Tower).
- **Art Style Consistency:** Discussion about the art style of background billboards, with Kaze considering changes to Koopa faces to better match the game's overall aesthetic.
- **Technical Challenges:**
    - **Tooling Issues:** Kaze struggles with OBS crashing, different Blender versions having incompatible controls/presets ("Oh no, my Blender 4 controls are completely fucked"), and issues with Fast64 presets.
    - **Bug Fixing:** Identifying and planning to fix various bugs, such as collision issues ("I also really need to fix the collision map here"), rendering problems ("Got a few issues Your problems But some of the level is here"), fog issues, and a soft lock ("do not update mario's safe position when hanging on the bench").
    - **Performance/Optimization:** Considerations for polycount ("I think it's somewhat increased here... But I don't think that is significant enough to be a problem"), though Biobak's rework of Oily Boily Bay resulted in "1,700 fewer tries."
- **Integrating Collaborator Work:** A significant portion of the stream is dedicated to integrating and refining Biobak's extensive rework of Oily Boily Bay, which involves reviewing a detailed changelog, importing assets, and troubleshooting visual/technical issues.
- **Camera and Physics:** A core focus for the upcoming demo is to gather feedback on the camera and physics, indicating these are key areas of ongoing development and refinement.

## Business Aspects
- **Marketing/Hype:** Kaze considers showcasing the visually impressive Oily Boily Bay level on his main channel to "make people more hype for the demo."
- **Player Feedback:** The planned demo for Course 1 is explicitly for gathering "a lot of playtest data" and "Feedback on the physics and the camera," suggesting a community-involved approach to refinement.
- **Future Aspirations:** A brief mention of future potential: "one day after rty [Return to Yoshi's Island] we will absolutely just turn this into like a proper game company and we will make so much money."
- **Funding:** No direct mention of funding sources in this transcript.

## Key Quotes
- "I'm thinking what we should do is make another demo with just course one and then we use that to get Feedback on the physics and the camera and I think that would be fun to help us make the game more fun." (Explains demo strategy and focus)
- "Dude, the movement in this game feels so good to me now. It's so fun to just move around." (Highlights Kaze's satisfaction with core gameplay feel)
