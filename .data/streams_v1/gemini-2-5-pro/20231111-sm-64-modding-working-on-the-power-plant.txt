## Game Development Process
- The project "Return to Yoshi's Island" (RTYI) is actively in development, with a significant portion of levels still needing completion (Kaze mentions "we need to finish like nine levels I think").
- Development involves a systematic bug-fixing process, tackling issues course by course. Kaze mentions having stopped at "course 4" in his bug-fixing pass.
- Asset integration from collaborators is a key activity, involving importing models, textures, and animations.
- A significant amount of time is spent on troubleshooting technical issues, including N64-specific bugs (e.g., "geo bone" system, sound computation), exporter problems (Blender plugins), and unexpected behaviors in custom code.
- Iteration is constant: new features or optimizations can break existing content, requiring ongoing maintenance ("we often break a lot of old stuff").
- Kaze mentions that RTYI might be "75% done" (a figure attributed to Lila, which Kaze contextualizes regarding her specific tasks) but focuses on the remaining work rather than a fixed percentage.
- Development includes creating new tools or plugins, like the "mini n64 object exporter" for Blender, to achieve specific animation goals.

## Personal Insights
- Kaze prioritizes player "excitement" over raw "difficulty" in game design, aiming for engaging experiences rather than frustrating challenges.
- He reflects on past projects like "Lost Impact," acknowledging that his earlier, less compromising approach to implementing every idea sometimes led to suboptimal game design.
- Kaze believes in rapid prototyping and feedback for learning game design: "spam games... spending two weeks on each get a bunch of feedback."
- He expresses a desire for efficiency, both in personal habits (like disliking time-inefficient barbers) and in development (e.g., optimizing N64 matrix multiplications).
- Kaze has a clear vision for his future, seeing RTYI as a stepping stone and "advertisement" for an original IP he plans to develop and fund via Kickstarter.
- He shows a mix of confidence in his skills (e.g., Unreal Engine programming) and candidness about ongoing challenges and learning.

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub (Composer):** No relevant information found in this transcript. (The prompt mentioned Badub as the composer).
- **Biobak (Biobak - Graphics Artist):**
    - A significant contributor of 3D models and textures. Kaze states, "the Biobak made a bunch of stuff for us that we need."
    - Assets mentioned include Amps, the airplane, a "cell guy" (Shy Guy variant), the speed ring, and textures for the airplane's propeller and dust trail.
    - Kaze integrates Biobak's assets, sometimes needing to adjust them or discuss design choices (e.g., airplane dust trail texture).
- **Zeina (Zeina - Animations):**
    - Responsible for character animations. Kaze mentions, "I need the animations finished from Zeina first We need to finish the penguins mission."
    - Specific animations cited include those for penguins and Dory. Kaze notes that "all the penguins need animations" and refers to Dory's animations as being "fucked up animation wise" due to the old geo bones system.
    - Zeina was present at Kaze's house during the stream.
- **Other Contributors:**
    - **Lila:** An active and knowledgeable chat participant whom Kaze mentions is "working on tools right now that is way more valuable" than finishing a "match." She engages in technical discussions about texture formats and Blender issues.
    - **Rionno:** Mentioned as a "professionally educated game translator" who will be doing the Spanish translation for RTYI.
    - **That Cozy:** Creator of the "mini n64 object exporter" Blender plugin that Kaze attempts to use.
    - **Zerovolt:** Kaze mentions potentially hiring Zerovolt to "make music" for his future original IP.
    - Chat participants like "Mr. Common," "Holly," "Sam," "P4 DD" provide feedback or engage in discussions, illustrating community interaction.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Feature Removal for User Experience:** The "instant pause exit" feature was removed "so that bad players don't accidentally exit levels," showing a consideration for broader player accessibility.
- **Balancing Difficulty and Engagement:** The airplane minigame is designed to be "difficult to control" but the mission itself "very easy to pass." The falling platform sequence is intended to "feel a lot more intense without actually making it more difficult."
- **N64 Technical Limitations:**
    - Constant struggle with optimizing for the N64, such as discussions around texture formats (IA4 vs. IA8, CI4, CI8) balancing detail, color depth, and memory/performance.
    - Fixing legacy N64 engine bugs like the "geo bone" issue to save on matrix multiplications.
    - A sound bug where distant actors' sounds play as if right on top of the camera due to issues in sound computation.
- **Tooling and Workflow Issues:**
    - Significant time spent troubleshooting Blender exporters (e.g., the "mini n64 object exporter" not working with a newer Blender version).
    - Losing texture data because it was "just bytes" and needing to recreate or find previous versions.
- **Iterative Design and Bug Fixing:**
    - "Random rock" spawner not working as intended, only spawning one type of rock.
    - Mario's shadow missing, warps being too small due to parameter overrides.
    - A "floor" collision bug discovered and fixed live.
    - Refining the airplane's dust trail effect involved tweaking combiners and textures.
- **Level Design Philosophy:** Kaze aims for "purpose" in level design, with some sections designed primarily as "a cool set piece that looks cool to look at." He's willing to adjust difficulty down if a section feels frustrating over solid ground.
- **Camera Considerations:** Aware of how camera placement can negatively impact platforming, Kaze makes adjustments to improve it.

## Business Aspects
- **Future Original IP and Kickstarter:** Kaze explicitly plans to "announce our own game project our own IP and we're gonna make a kickstarter there" shortly before or upon RTYI's release.
- **RTYI as Marketing:** RTYI is viewed as a major project that will serve as "advertisement" for this future original game, leveraging its potential popularity.
- **Team Expansion Plans:** The Kickstarter funds would be used to "hire a bunch of people," including potentially Zerovolt for music and Biobak for level design.
- **Social Media Strategy:** Kaze discusses using Twitter for promotion closer to release, being mindful of algorithm impacts (e.g., not directly linking YouTube to avoid deprioritization). He acknowledges Twitter's role in gaining views for past content.
- **Monetization:** Donations are received during the stream, indicating a form of direct community support.

## Key Quotes
- "I just don't think difficulty is good. I don't want difficulty. I want excitement. You know what I mean?" (Kaze's game design philosophy)
- "See the thing is when we work on a new level or new optimizations, we often break a lot of old stuff So a lot of old levels are really broken right now." (On the iterative and sometimes challenging nature of game development)
- "Return to Yoshi's Island you think it might be my biggest project ever it will be the advertisement... then when Return to Yoshi's Island launches we also launch the kickstarter for the own game and then I can hire a bunch of people." (On the strategic plan for RTYI and future projects)
