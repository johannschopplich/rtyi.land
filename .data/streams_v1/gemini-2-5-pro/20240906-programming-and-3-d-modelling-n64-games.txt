## Game Development Process
- Kaze is actively working on his "major hack," "Return to Yoshi's Island."
- Off-stream work included "basic uv-mapping" for various elements.
- A current project on stream is "getting the UVs for the walls to look half decent," followed by work on a "retro section."
- The game is structured with courses; Kaze mentions being "in course 13" and that "the Space Arcade and the Papercraft level are the last two" (though he then immediately starts planning a Super Mario Land 1 retro level, suggesting its placement might be flexible or for a different purpose like an "8-bit pipe").
- A significant technical task involved "swapping layer 5 and layer 6... permanently swapped the draw layers" across all levels, which required careful implementation.
- Debugging crashes is a frequent and time-consuming part of the process, with causes traced to collision triangles, specific actors, and coin formations.
- Development involves creating 3D models from 2D sprites, as seen with the Mario plane for the Super Mario Land 1 level.

## Personal Insights
- Kaze approaches his work with dedication, humorously stating, "I have officially lost my mind. I am actually working. On my major hack."
- He finds streaming to be an efficient way to work: "I'm gonna just stream like basically every day now. Because I'm very efficient working on stream."
- Personal nostalgia influences design choices, such as the inclusion of a Super Mario Land 1 level: "I haven't played Land 2 as a child. So for me, Land 1 is like the only one that I will have some nostalgia for."
- Kaze has a pragmatic approach to development tools, particularly emulators: "The thing is, every emulator is broken as fuck... I just have to pick one emulator and run with it." He chooses Project64 for its usability and his familiarity with its bugs.
- He expresses strong opinions on development practices and tools, for example, his decided preference against using the Parallel emulator.

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub (composer):** No relevant information found in this transcript.
- **Biobak (graphics artist, referred to as "Biobak" in chat):**
    - Engages in discussions with Kaze regarding retro level design, offering suggestions. Kaze acknowledges these: "That works too, Biobak, yeah?"
    - Implied to be a source of feedback or ideas for visual/design aspects.
- **Zeina (animations):** No relevant information found in this transcript.
- **Other Contributors:**
    - **Lila:** Frequently interacts with Kaze in chat, providing technical advice, helping troubleshoot, and managing repository elements (e.g., renaming draw layers). Kaze values their input ("Yeah, this is pretty nice, Leela. I like this a lot.").
    - **Strygon:** Kaze mentions, "I'm going to run Strygon to update the Upgrader UI to get it to update correctly," indicating Strygon developed or provided a tool Kaze uses for his development pipeline.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Key Design Choices:**
    - Inclusion of "retro sections" based on pre-Mario 64 games. Super Mario Land 1 is chosen for an "8-bit pipe."
    - The Super Mario Land 1 level will be black and white ("essential to the aesthetic") and feature forced-perspective, rail-shooter gameplay where Mario is in a plane.
    - Only games released before Mario 64 are eligible for these retro levels to maintain temporal consistency.
    - Decision to use fog in the SML1 level to manage draw distance and aesthetics.
    - Deliberate choice to fix the N64 graph render code to improve performance ("Make it all fit into one block of cache. And now the entire game runs at 30 FPS").
- **Obstacles Faced & Solutions:**
    - Frequent game crashes are a major challenge, requiring systematic debugging (e.g., isolating issues to coin formations, specific actors, or collision data).
    - Lost work due to unforeseen consequences of actions: "I just undid a lot of work" after realizing projecting UVs undid previous work on certain models.
    - Technical challenge of creating suitable assets for retro levels, such as making 2D front sprites for 3D enemies in the SML1 level, or creating a 3D model of Mario's plane from its original 2D sprite.
    - Deciding on the best way to implement vehicle sections from retro games to be engaging in 3D.
    - Managing N64 limitations, such as draw layers and optimizing for the RSP.
    - Ensuring compatibility with the chosen emulator (Project64 with Gliden) and deliberately not supporting others to save effort.

## Business Aspects
- Kaze mentions a potential promotional opportunity: "So it looks like there's a chance that I'm going to get a mystery box gifted from some weeb gift shop thing. And they want me to just give away some stuff."
- Streaming is linked to income, influencing his work schedule: "But also, I need to work more because I want to make more money. So that's why I'm gonna just stream like basically every day now."
- A joking comment about potentially "mining Bitcoin in the idle thread while you're playing the game" as a way for players to "give back."

## Key Quotes
- "I am actually working. On my major hack. What is going on?" (Captures his dedication and the intensity of the project).
- "So, we're thinking Mario Land 1 for the 8-bit pipe... Now we're definitely doing the whole thing in black and white. That's essential to the aesthetic." (Highlights a specific design decision and its rationale).
- "The thing is, every emulator is broken as fuck. It's just that I've been using this emulator because this one is the easiest one to use... If I wanted to support a second emulator, I would have to also work around all the bugs in that emulator. So for me, I just have to pick one emulator and run with it." (Explains his pragmatic approach to technical challenges).

## Potential Interview Topics
- **The Philosophy and Process of Retro Level Integration:** Delve deeper into the decision-making for choosing specific retro games like Super Mario Land 1, the creative and technical process of adapting 2D gameplay to a 3D engine, and how these sections fit into the overall vision for "Return to Yoshi's Island."
- **Navigating N64 Limitations and Emulator Quirks:** Explore Kaze's strategies for working within the N64's constraints (e.g., RSP, graph rendering, memory), his choice of Project64/Gliden, and how these technical aspects shape the game's development and final form.
- **The Role of Live Streaming and Community in Development:** Discuss how streaming impacts his workflow, efficiency, and creative process. How do interactions with collaborators like Lila and Biobak, and the broader chat community, influence design decisions or problem-solving?
- **Balancing Technical Challenges with Creative Vision:** Inquire about the most significant technical hurdles encountered (like the persistent crashes or asset creation for retro levels) and how he maintains his creative drive and project goals amidst such challenges.
- **Personal Motivations and the Scope of "Return to Yoshi's Island":** Ask about his personal connection to the project, what drives his dedication (e.g., nostalgia, desire to push SM64 modding), and what he ultimately hopes players will experience with this ambitious ROM hack.
