## Game Development Process
- Currently focused on developing the "snowman cave" level for "Return to Yoshi's Island," including designing rooms (slide, platforms over void, cliff climbing, treasure room), implementing enemy behavior (snowmen), and refining platforming sections.
- Iterative development approach: greyboxing levels, implementing mechanics, testing (with a fast N64 setup), and refining visuals and gameplay.
- Progress is tracked by objectives like completing platforming for specific "stars" within levels.
- Upcoming milestones include a public demo release for "Course 1" to gather feedback.
- Kaze is also working on other content, such as YouTube videos (e.g., "F3," "Matrix video").
- A significant recent improvement is a faster N64 testing pipeline: "look how fast n64 testing is now that i have to set up i just click the bat and it's there it's right on my n64."

## Personal Insights
- Kaze values creating "distinct experiences" and conveying specific "ideas" through his game development work.
- He demonstrates a strong commitment to N64 authenticity, intentionally working within the original console's limitations (e.g., ROM space: "If I don't stay within the original limitations, am I not kind of cheating?").
- He is open about the challenges of game development, including moments of creative block ("Wow, that's ugly... Surely we can figure something out later") and personal state ("I don't know what's up with me today, but I'm not feeling mentally clear").
- Kaze reflects on the importance of focused work and the potential pitfalls of constant distraction, valuing boredom for creativity.
- He has a critical view of certain game development engines (Unity, MATLAB) and expresses preferences for others (Unreal Engine for future original projects).

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub:** Credited as "Badub making music." Responsible for the game's soundtrack.
- **Mario back / Biobak:** Credited as "Mario back helping with all the models. He whenever I'm done with the model, he looks over it again and makes it look a lot better." Focuses on refining and improving 3D models.
- **Zeina:** Helps with "a lot of stuff. Mostly like concept art and stuff." Her "biggest one she's doing" is animations. She is also a close personal relation to Kaze, and her impending child with Kaze is mentioned.
- **Other Contributors:**
    - **Unnamed Video Editor:** Kaze has recently hired someone to edit his YouTube videos, paying "$16 per minute of video."
    - **Unnamed Video Editor (for specific video):** "there's someone who wants to help me edit the whole thing [random matrices video]." This might be the same person or a different one.
    - **General Community Contributors:** "And then sometimes people just randomly contribute small things."

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Snowman Cave Level Design:** Brainstorming and implementing various room types: a slide with attacking snowmen, platforms over a void, a cliff-climbing section, and a final ice slide into a treasure room.
- **Shadow System:** Planning a significant rework of shadows: "My idea for the shadows is that it's actually going to be a whole separate object, separate from Mario... So it can have a different floor from Mario."
- **Enemy AI:** Refining enemy behavior, such as adding vertical distance checks for block attacks and adjusting snowman attack rates.
- **Aesthetics vs. Gameplay:** Struggling with the visual appeal of certain areas ("Wow, that's ugly... The whole level is ugly right now") while prioritizing platforming and mechanics first. Decision to use placeholder textures and refine visuals later.
- **Elevator Mechanics:** Debated making the elevator teleport vs. move, opting for movement as "easier." Iterating on visual feedback like screen shake for the elevator, trying to find a balance.
- **N64 Limitations:** Constant awareness of N64 hardware constraints, particularly ROM space for assets like voice lines ("Rom space is actually one of our most limited resources").
- **Platforming Robustness:** Ensuring multiple paths and fair challenges, adjusting geometry to prevent players from getting stuck or having unfair deaths.
- **Bug Fixing:** Actively identifying and fixing bugs during the stream, like snowmen not attacking correctly when multiple are present.

## Business Aspects
- **YouTube Channel Growth:** Aims to significantly grow his YouTube channel ("I feel like we could hit a million subs if we actually went in hard on that"), investing in a paid video editor to increase content output and quality. The channel serves as a marketing and community engagement platform.
- **Public Demo and Feedback:** Plans to release a demo of "Course 1" and use a "Google document where people can answer all kinds of questions" to gather player feedback for refinement.
- **Stream Monetization:** Receives support through Twitch/YouTube features like subscriptions ("Thank you for the sub, Sonic the Hedgehog") and donations ("Thank you for your bezos buck leela").
- **Future Open Source Project:** Considers starting an open-source project after RTYI is done to "port back all of the RTUI optimizations to vanilla Mark 64."
- **No direct sales of RTYI mentioned**, which is typical for ROM hacks.

## Key Quotes
- "My idea for the shadows is that it's actually going to be a whole separate object, separate from Mario... That way it will be all fine. So it can have a different floor from Mario." (Reveals a significant technical and design approach for a core visual element).
- "If I don't stay within the original limitations, am I not kind of cheating? You see the issue. I don't want to finish the game and then people are like, oh, yeah, but to use more memory, though." (Highlights his core philosophy regarding N64 development and authenticity).
- "Yeah, we got a Badub help and we got a Mario back helping with all the models... And we got Zayna helping with a lot of stuff. Mostly like concept art and stuff... Oh yeah, animations are the biggest one she's doing." (Summarizes the key roles of his collaborators).

## Potential Interview Topics
- **Creative Vision for RTYI:** Explore the core "ideas" and "distinct experiences" Kaze aims to deliver with RTYI, and how these aspirations guide his design choices within the Mario 64 framework.
- **Balancing Authenticity and Innovation:** Discuss the challenges and rewards of strictly adhering to N64 limitations while still aiming to innovate and implement substantial improvements (like the shadow system or his list of "100 little things").
- **The Collaborative Process:** Delve deeper into the working dynamics with Zeina, Badub, and Biobak/Mario back. How are creative differences handled? How does their input shape the final product?
- **Level Design Philosophy (The "Case Method"):** Ask Kaze to elaborate on his personal approach to level design, particularly for a 3D platformer, and how he iterates from initial concept to a polished, playable space like the "snowman cave."
- **Navigating the ROM Hacking Landscape:** Discuss his experiences with Nintendo's policies (video takedowns), his perspective on the decompilation project's impact, and his plans for contributing back to the community (e.g., the open-source optimization project).
- **Impact of Personal Life on Development:** With impending fatherhood, explore how Kaze anticipates his personal life changes might influence his development schedule, creative focus, or even the themes within his work.
