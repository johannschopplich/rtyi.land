## Game Development Process
- Significant progress made on a new "cowboy" themed level for "Return to Yoshi's Island."
- Detailed planning and initial implementation of various buildings and structures within the cowboy level:
    - Sheriff's Office (with wanted posters for catchable criminals).
    - Cowboy Store (for browsing hats, not purchasing).
    - "Big Iron Store" (a gun store, featuring cork guns).
    - Hotel (name pending).
    - Train tracks and a functional train.
    - Several "random houses" for environmental detail.
    - "Tumbleweed Store" (a humorous concept with a shady seller).
    - Chain shop.
    - Bank (involved in a post-robbery scenario for the player).
    - "Unagi Oil Store" (another humorous, themed shop).
    - Saloon.
- Development of interactive elements like kickable tumbleweeds and a system for catching criminals.
- Live modeling and texturing of the train, referencing designs from Kalimari Desert (Mario Kart 64) and Mario Kart 7, but aiming for a unique style fitting the game.
- Consideration of level performance, noting the current cowboy level runs at 40-50 FPS unoptimized.
- Implemented features specific to emulator detection, such as unlimited draw distances and a 60 FPS default.
- Enemies for the level are planned: a gang of five Goombas, a Snuffit, and a Shy Guy, all themed as cowboys.

## Personal Insights
- Kaze expresses a strong, humorous, and slightly satirical vision for the cowboy level's theme: "See, okay my vision for this is, you know, how there's weeaboos And they take japanese culture and they completely overdo it. I'm doing that to american culture the cowboys We want to just a hundred percent cowboy this like we we move to the cowboy slider all the way to the right And then we keep going We're going as cowboy as we can possibly be."
- He shows dedication to thematic immersion, stating he's been "only watching cowboy tv shows while working on this."
- Kaze shares his disappointment when a YouTube video he's proud of ("my favorite video ever") underperforms, but also analyzes its metrics with cautious optimism.
- He expresses opinions on various external topics, including other game franchises (Sonic, Pokemon, Zelda), superhero movies, and his personal history with programming (starting with TI Basic, then assembly at 17).
- He has a clear preference for creating unique and often humorous game elements, such as the "Tumbleweed Store" and "Unagi Oil Store."

    - Viewers in chat provide suggestions and feedback, influencing decisions like prioritizing work on the train.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Thematic Choices:**
    - Strong "cowboy" theme for the new level, with an emphasis on exaggerated Americana.
    - Decision to use "cork guns" instead of realistic firearms to maintain a certain tone.
    - Deliberate exclusion of Native American stereotypes to avoid controversy and because it doesn't fit the intended "over-the-top cowboy" focus.
- **Asset Design & Art Style:**
    - Debate and iteration on the train's design, aiming for an N64-esque style that's an improvement but not a direct copy of existing Mario Kart trains: "Is it bad if we don't use the exact same train? I feel like it kinda is. But this also just doesn't fit the art style of my game. I feel like I should get an in-between of the both."
    - Challenges in creating specific visual elements like the "64" logo on the train to a satisfactory quality within Photoshop.
- **Gameplay Elements:**
    - Designing a system where players catch three criminals who then appear in the Sheriff's office.
    - Conceptualizing a "standoff" involving five Goombas, focusing on adding gameplay beyond just a vibe.
    - Deciding Mario will not have a cowboy hat skin for this level to avoid the work of implementing it across all levels. Potentially adding a "yeehaw" voice line for the ground pound jump.
- **Technical Challenges:**
    - Addressing issues with tumbleweed physics (spawning, half in the ground).
    - Encountering a problem with train track collision that needs to be fixed before the train's movement can be programmed.
    - Optimizing drawing methods for objects like coins (preferring screen space rendering for efficiency).

## Business Aspects
- Kaze discusses the YouTube performance of his videos, which serve as a primary marketing and community engagement tool for his projects. He analyzes metrics like click-through rates and views, speculating on YouTube's algorithm.
- Mention of "three releasios" already existing, implying previous releases of projects or versions of RTYI, but no specific release date for the current project is given.
- A brief, unrelated mention of using Payoneer for Patreon payouts.
- No direct discussion of funding for "Return to Yoshi's Island" or specific sales strategies in this transcript.
