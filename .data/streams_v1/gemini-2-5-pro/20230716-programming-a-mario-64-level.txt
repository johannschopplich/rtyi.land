## Game Development Process
- **Overall Progress:** The game "Return to Yoshi's Island" is actively in development. Kaze mentions the design document is growing, indicating ongoing planning and feature creep/expansion. He states, "The hack is coming along pretty well, I would say."
- **Specific Tasks:** Kaze is working on implementing new enemy behaviors (e.g., "seesaw guy" with a Goomba), refining existing models (Whomp), addressing collision issues, and optimizing performance for N64 hardware.
- **Iteration & Testing:** Playtesting has occurred (e.g., "I had a playtest happen on Course 2 in Return to Yoshi's Island. We've made some changes there."). Features are tested on N64 hardware to ensure compatibility and performance.
- **Side Projects:** Kaze is also working on a large level for a competition ("Only Up 64"), which showcases his continued engagement with pushing SM64 limits.
- **Engine Improvements:** Significant work has been done on improving the game's collision system ("You see how stable that is? Mario 64 would never be able to handle this.").

## Personal Insights
- **Motivation:** "My streams here and they are like all about the game if you get entertained that's a side effect I just care about making a good game." Kaze is primarily driven by the desire to create a high-quality game.
- **Self-Awareness:** "I am not a good enough animator to do that They would look worse if I did that" (regarding redoing Mario's base animations). He understands his skill limitations and focuses where he can make the most impact.
- **Creative Freedom:** "I mean the cool thing about my case clips channel here Is that I can just upload whatever the fuck I want and I don't really care if that fucks my algorithm or not I just do what I want and I like that." He values the freedom to work on and stream what he wants without algorithmic pressure.
- **Work Ethic:** Kaze is shown to be very busy, juggling game development with other commitments like a "presentation do it for like a tech conference."
- **Frustrations:** Expresses frustration with software (Blender removing features, YouTube stream delay) and technical challenges (compiler issues).

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub (Composer):**
    - Intended to create a song for an enemy/character: "I thought Badoop was gonna make him song but Badoop's been missing in attendance for a bit so I'm not really sure what to expect there."
    - Kaze hopes Badoop will also do sound design: "Please let Badoob do sound design as well, please. Yes, yes, yes, yes. Sound design is gonna happen at the end."
- **Biobak (Graphics Artist):**
    - Mentioned in chat interaction: "Oh shit, that's Actually, is that sad or neat Biobak? It's neat for me sad for you." (Specific contribution in this stream not detailed but implies ongoing collaboration).
    - Kaze refers to Biobak's understanding of development humor: "Yep, Biobak understands the assignment."
- **Zeina (Animations):**
    - Has provided animations for characters: "Zena made the animations for this guy already or most of them" (referring to the "cement pit guy").
    - Her work is needed for other characters as well: "The glass curry still need the animations."
    - Was unavailable during the stream: "Unfortunately, Zeyna is out with friends today, so you don't get to see her."
- **Other Contributors:**
    - No other direct, named contributors for "Return to Yoshi's Island" were explicitly detailed in this transcript as providing assets or code. "EZSpy" is mentioned as someone who might understand a compiler issue, suggesting a knowledgeable community contact.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Enemy Design:** Detailed planning for interactive enemy setups, such as the "seesaw guy" where breaking a box causes the seesaw to fall and affect a Goomba. Designing the Whomp as a construction worker.
- **Level Design Philosophy:** Prefers separate worlds with an interconnected overworld to avoid excessive backtracking, contrasting with *Banjo-Tooie*'s approach: "Having it the way Banjo-Tooie did it means you add a lot of backtracking and I don't like that."
- **Technical Challenges:**
    - **N64 Performance:** A major focus is ensuring levels run well on actual N64 hardware. This involves managing polygon counts ("13,000!"), draw distance, and exploring optimizations like backface culling. "Dude it's so unplayable with this input lag, I feel like a toddler" (when testing on N64 via stream setup).
    - **Collision:** Ongoing work to improve collision stability ("You guys probably can't really tell the difference but it's very noticeable when you're walking into ceilings like this it's a lot more stable now").
    - **Compiler Issues:** Encountered a significant compiler bug causing a division-by-zero on N64 due to instruction pipelining: "Basically, the compiler decided that right here, where I want to avoid the division by 0. It is going to pipeline the division into the delay slot of my branch."
- **Visuals & Assets:** Designing new assets like Tox Boxes and the "glass star," and considering how they look and function. "I Did I wish I was born like 10 years later so I could become one of those tick-tock livestream us I Okay, okay I am They are really stupid And I don't know why people watch them But the fact they are around like at all is amazing to me I Got them finding a texture is difficult."
- **Lore/World Building:** The game's setting was initially "Bozo's Fleet Factory" but has evolved: "it slowly became just like the place where they tank up, I guess."

## Business Aspects
- **Monetization & Funding:**
    - YouTube channel is "barely profitable, especially now that brilliant doesn't sponsor me anymore kind of back to square zero."
    - Mentions donations and song requests via donations are enabled.
- **Release Plans:**
    - No fixed release date: "Is the release date for your amazing games nope, just wait It's hard to predict when the release is gonna be."
- **Streaming Strategy:**
    - Streams on "Kaze Clips" channel (smaller sub count) rather than his main channel: "I don't want to stream on the main channel because this is not really the content that fits it I don't want to ruin my algorithm, you know." This is to target a dedicated audience interested in the game's development.
- **Marketing/Showcasing:** Mentions F3 (a game showcase event) but states his own mods are not shown there.

## Key Quotes
- "My streams here and they are like all about the game if you get entertained that's a side effect I just care about making a good game." (Reveals core motivation)
- "Basically, the compiler decided that right here, where I want to avoid the division by 0. It is going to pipeline the division into the delay slot of my branch. So that no matter what happens, I always divide by 0. That's not a bug in the code. That is not my fault." (Highlights deep technical challenges and frustrations)
- "Having an interconnected world is okay. I don't hate on it, but I think it's nicer if the worlds are like separate and the interconnectedness comes from the overworld alone." (Shows clear design philosophy)
