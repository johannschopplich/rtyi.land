## Game Development Process
- Currently focused on bug fixing for an upcoming demo release.
- Course 1 is mostly complete and is planned to be the content for a second demo.
- The overall project involves multiple courses (e.g., Course 1, 13, 14, 15) which are in various stages of planning and completion.
- Kaze is actively working on integrating assets and features, such as a line of mushrooms from a collaborator and the Yoshi Coin radar.
- Milestones include testing the demo on N64 hardware.
- The game will feature seven stars per act, with the seventh being "find the egg coins."

## Personal Insights
- Kaze prioritizes player experience, aiming to avoid frustrating mechanics and ensure features feel valuable and "cool." He states, "That's gonna be a miserable experience people are gonna hate that and I want to avoid that experience happening to anyone."
- He has a strong vision for the game's features, believing the coin system will "feel more valuable than Mario Odyssey."
- Kaze expresses frustration with software like Parallel Launcher due to frequent updates, but uses it for testing compatibility: "I only use parallel launcher to test if my game works on power launcher because I will never personally myself use power launcher."
- He is not interested in adding Rumble Pak support due to development overhead and not owning one himself.
- He shows a pragmatic approach to problem-solving, such as when identifying the B-Param issue causing objects not to spawn.

- Zeina:
    - Present during the stream ("You You Zeina in the house. She is in the house. Just chillin").
    - Kaze mentions wanting Zeina ("zainab") to pick up a second N64 console, suggesting she assists with tasks beyond a specific defined role. No specific animation contributions are discussed in this transcript.
- Other Contributors:
    - "my bike": Mentioned as working on assets. "There is a line of mushrooms that my bike is working on that I need to put in." This contributor is likely a graphics artist.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Yoshi Coin Radar:**
    - Initially considered as a buyable item, but changed to be automatically available during "Act 7: Find the Egg Coins" to prevent player frustration.
    - The radar functions similarly to Sonic Adventure 1's, blinking faster and changing color (e.g., to red) as the player gets closer to an egg coin.
    - Ongoing design considerations include the blinking effect being potentially distracting, the color of the radar icons vs. the in-level coin colors, and using transparency to indicate proximity or collection status.
- **Yoshi Coins & Economy:**
    - Coins are global and will be used for "overworld upgrades," such as donating to an NPC to build a bridge, allowing players to "affect the world by giving people money."
    - The goal is to make coins feel "very cool" and more valuable than in games like Mario Odyssey.
- **Level Design & Structure:**
    - Acts will have seven stars instead of the traditional six.
    - Course 13 is an "ice castle" (basically done).
    - Course 14 is a "craft world" (mostly done).
    - Course 15 is a "space arcade" (described as a "pathway," implying early stages).
- **Technical Challenges & Solutions:**
    - Fixing a bug where dynamic lights were not spawning in an area. Kaze discovered this was due to a Mario 64 engine feature where setting B-Param 3 to 255 prevents an object from spawning.
    - Addressing issues with texture resolution ("one pixel of texture is exactly one pixel of output on a nintendo 64 so if we grew or shrunk it that would look really bad").
    - Issues with lighting on Mario in a previous showcase video have since been fixed.

## Business Aspects
- **Demo Releases:**
    - Actively working on fixing bugs for a demo release.
    - A second demo is planned which will feature "only course one."
- **Community Interaction:**
    - Kaze interacts with his stream chat, acknowledging resubscriptions (e.g., "Thank you for the resub Davey").
- **Platform Awareness (Indirect):**
    - Briefly discusses a Nintendo strike issue concerning another creator (SM64 GOSSIP), indicating an awareness of potential platform-related risks for ROM hacking projects. Kaze believes the strike was from an "imposter."
- No direct mentions of funding or specific marketing strategies beyond demo releases were found in this transcript.

## Key Quotes
- "Imagine this situation imagine you have not bought the radar and you're doing a mission 7 and the game doesn't give you any hint at All that's gonna suck That's gonna be a miserable experience people are gonna hate that and I want to avoid that experience happening to anyone." (Explaining the decision to make the radar automatically available for Act 7)
- "The coins are gonna be there to buy over what upgrades so like maybe there will be a guy that wants to build a bridge But he needs a donation of 500 coins to buy the materials. So you give them the money and then the overall changes You're actually gonna affect the world by giving people money That's gonna be so cool." (Describing the purpose of Yoshi Coins)
- "There's a functionality in the Mario 64 engine where if you set the beep harm free to 255 the object does not spawn This is so fucking wild." (On discovering an obscure engine feature causing a bug)

- The iterative design process of the Yoshi Coin radar, balancing utility with avoiding player distraction or making treasure hunts too simplistic.
- The decision to structure the game with seven stars per act and how the "Find the Egg Coins" mission integrates with the overall level design and progression.
- Challenges and unique discoveries while working with the SM64 decompilation, such as the B-Param issue, and how these affect development.
- The collaborative process with team members like "my bike" and Zeina, and how their contributions are integrated into the project.
