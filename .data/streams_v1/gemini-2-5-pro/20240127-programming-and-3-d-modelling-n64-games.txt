## Game Development Process
- Kaze is actively working on a specific "cowboy level," focusing on a complex minecart sequence.
- Current stage involves programming core mechanics and interactions, with visual polish and some asset creation (e.g., "milk bottles" by Zeina) happening concurrently or planned.
- Integration of graphical assets from collaborators (e.g., Biobak's "biomex things") is ongoing.
- The process is highly iterative, involving coding, testing, identifying issues, and redesigning gameplay segments (e.g., the minecart chase).
- Kaze mentions working on the level for "the last two weeks" or "last week," indicating focused development periods on specific features.
- He utilizes a custom engine with features like setting camera angles on level entry.

## Personal Insights
- Kaze expresses strong passion and enthusiasm for visually appealing elements he creates or incorporates: "Yeah, dude, I love this the fucking moon up there. Oh my god, this is so sexy."
- He believes in making changes for better player experience, even if it deviates from original game mechanics: "I Also made it so that red coin stars don't put you out of the stage anymore, I think that was a necessary change."
- He takes pride in the technical achievements of the project: "The crazy part is the game doesn't look like it can run on an N64 but it does."
- He has a critical view on certain game development practices and player skill: "I think people are just such bad gamers that they can't tell when their analog 3d platformers don't have analog controls it's like serving a soup full of piss to people that just have never had good food in their life they're not gonna notice it's full of piss."
- He reflects on his content creation strategy for YouTube: "Making level previews on YouTube is just not a good business model. I have to make technical videos, unfortunately."

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub (Composer):** No relevant information found in this transcript.
- **Biobak (Graphics Artist):**
    - Provides graphical assets referred to as "biomex things" that Kaze is importing into the level.
    - Kaze directly addresses Biobak ("biomeg") in the chat regarding these assets: "oh yeah biomeg you’re like the first person is this what you wanted i think it’s good."
- **Zeina (Animations/Assets):**
    - Tasked with creating specific in-game assets: "oh, yeah Zeina Then you make milk bottles. I need them We need milk bottles."
    - Appears to be in the same physical location or working environment as Kaze during the stream, as Kaze comments on noise she's making: "Oh, what is that ungodly noise? What the fuck is Zeina doing up there?" and later "no dude zana you were so loud earlier you were at the furnace earlier."
- **Other Contributors:** No other specific game development contributors are clearly identified or their roles detailed in this transcript.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Red Coin Stars:** Changed so they no longer eject the player from the stage, considered a "necessary change" for player experience.
- **100 Coin Stars:** Kaze states, "I don't think 100 coin stars should be in this game." Red coins, if they existed, would also not boot the player out.
- **Minecart Sequence (Cowboy Level):**
    - **Initial Concept:** Shy Guys/Snifits in minecarts, Mario jumps between them.
    - **Challenge:** Swapping between minecarts proved "really, really difficult" for the player.
    - **Iteration 1:** Mario on one large minecart platform, with Shy Guys in smaller carts.
    - **Challenge:** Player potentially getting squished on tracks or falling off unfairly.
    - **Iteration 2 (Solution):** Implemented a cutscene for the Shy Guys jumping into their carts to control the setup and prevent the player from jumping in too early or getting unfairly hit. The player's minecart movement is then managed relative to the Shy Guy carts.
    - **Ongoing Challenge:** Fine-tuning the speed, spacing, and behavior of the minecarts to make the chase engaging and fair. Debugging issues like carts crashing or Mario falling off.
- **Camera Control:**
    - Issue with doors letting the camera through: "I feel like doors should never let the camera through."
    - Debugging camera clipping during cutscenes, requiring adjustments to room geometry and camera flags.
- **Character Movement & Physics:**
    - Addressed "jittery motions" of characters by decoupling face angle from move angle.
    - Implemented and debugged an "align to surface" function for Mario.
    - Strong emphasis on proper analog stick control for movement.
- **Sound Design:** Implemented new sound effects for actions like ground pound jump (from Mario Kart 64), spin jump (Melee-inspired), and a new falling sound, actively seeking feedback from chat.

## Business Aspects
- **Monetization & Finances:**
    - Kaze is exploring Twitter monetization: "Dude I actually looked into Twitter monetization today It looks like if I could monetize my Twitter account, that'd be like $200 a month."
    - Considering hiring a social media manager, possibly on a revenue-sharing basis.
    - Experiencing issues with PayPal: "I'm I'm getting PayPal cocked they refused to let me use my PayPal money."
- **Content Strategy (YouTube):**
    - Believes "Making level previews on YouTube is just not a good business model."
    - Prefers making "technical videos" for better engagement/viability.
- **Distribution:** No specific plans for release or distribution of "Return to Yoshi's Island" are mentioned in this transcript, beyond the general context of ROM hacking.

## Key Quotes
- "The crazy part is the game doesn't look like it can run on an N64 but it does." (Highlights technical ambition and achievement)
- "Okay, but swapping between Minecarts is really, really difficult. Holy shit. I can't expect players to do that. How do we make this better?" (Illustrates the iterative design process and focus on playability)
- "I want to make sure no one gets stuck ever. Luigi mode. We call it little brother mode, but you know, you are the little brother." (Humorous take on accessibility, though later ideas are more serious)

## Potential Interview Topics
