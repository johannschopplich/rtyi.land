## Game Development Process
-   Currently focused on developing an "8-bit section" (oil-themed area) and has just finished work on a new enemy, "Fizz Oil," for this section.
-   Significant progress on "Course 4" (the Zoo level): It has been fixed up and is ready for beta testing once animations from Zeina are complete.
-   Ongoing process of fixing older levels that break due to new development work.
-   Kaze mentions working on a new doll remodel and significant improvements to the Chain Chomp model (new look, new eyes) for Course 4.
-   Volley (another character/enemy) is slated to receive new animations.
-   The team is using hashing tables for geo layouts, which provides significantly more space for models compared to traditional methods.

## Personal Insights
-   Kaze expresses a pragmatic approach to tool limitations, such as render bugs in Fast64, stating, "not much we can do about that we're just gonna have to live with it."
-   He shows humility about the game's reception: "it could be that the gameplay i'm designing is just bad you know i mean of course i'm hoping it's good but you never know."
-   He finds technical advancements freeing, such as the move to hashing tables for geo layouts: "Dude, that's actually so freeing that we have hashing tables now instead of normal geo layouts, because now we have so much more space for geos."
-   Reflects on past projects, e.g., clarifying that "Return to Yoshi's Island" was never a "Last Impact" sequel, and any such prior insinuation was "just to get clicks on a youtube video."
-   He acknowledges the challenge of N64-style low-poly modeling: "i'm not sure how i'm gonna model in drill n64 style low poly that seems like a challenge."

## Collaborator Information
-   **Badub:** No relevant information found in this transcript.
-   **Biobak:**
    -   Kaze mentions being mindful of Biobak's standards for polygon counts: "There are some polygons I can remove here, some sneaky triangles, before Biobak cusses me out."
    -   Kaze clarifies that he (Kaze) modeled the specific assets being worked on during the stream: "No, Biobak did not make any of this. I made this." This implies Biobak's role might be more related to quality control, art direction, or contributions to other assets.
-   **Zeina:**
    -   Zeina is responsible for animations. Her work is pending for "Course 4" (the Zoo level) to become fully functional and ready for beta testing: "all we're waiting now is for a few animations that zena's making and after that quiz 4 is once again functional."
    -   Mentioned as being "out with friends" during the stream.
-   **Other Contributors:**
    -   **Lila:** Appears to be a chat moderator. No direct creative contributions to the game mentioned in this transcript, but active in the community.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
-   **Enemy Design (Fizz Oil):**
    -   Conceptualized as an oil-based enemy inspired by "Fizz Lit" (an electric enemy, possibly from Nintendo).
    -   Behavior: Slimes around, then "whoops" into a puddle form that Mario can slide on.
    -   Visuals: Features three different eyes that change based on its state/actions.
    -   Interaction: Makes the ground slippery when in puddle form. Not intended to be super dangerous, more "vibe-giving" but can cause Mario to slide into hazards (e.g., boiling oil, off ledges).
    -   Defeat Mechanic: Can be killed with soap, which also serves as a hint for a potential boss mechanic. Drops coins upon defeat.
    -   Particle effects for death: Dark smoke particles to signify being "cleaned up."
-   **Level Design (Oil Area / 8-bit Section):**
    -   Features an oil drill Kaze models low-poly.
    -   Intends to add "oil clouds" and "dead fish" for environmental storytelling.
    -   Includes staircases that become dangerous with the Fizz Oil's slippery mechanic.
    -   Needs a "boiling oil environment effect" at the bottom of the area.
-   **Technical Challenges & Solutions:**
    -   Dealing with render bugs in Fast64 (a modeling tool).
    -   Implementing slippery surfaces dynamically by altering triangle properties on the fly when Mario is near a Fizz Oil, rather than modifying core engine code. Kaze prefers this as it's less invasive.
    -   Addressing clipping issues, for instance, with the Fizz Oil enemy on staircases.
    -   Debugging animation and texture issues for the Fizz Oil enemy.
-   **Gameplay Mechanics:**
    -   Considering nerfing the "Moonswim" mechanic due to it being "pretty OP."
    -   Star Select concept: "the idea with the star selects is that it shows mario traveling to the level."

## Business Aspects
-   **Marketing/Promotion:**
    -   Kaze acknowledges using social media (Twitter) for "clout": "I do wanna post that screenshot on Twitter, because it's gonna be insane clout."
    -   Admits to previously calling a project a "Last Impact sequel" specifically "to get clicks on a youtube video."
-   **Release/Distribution:**
    -   Explicitly states the game will be open-sourced: "I will definitely open sources like no worry This is guaranteed open source I want people to be ableable to maintain this code base after I leave the scene And I want other people to be able to make hex off of my engine."
-   **Financial Viability (of game dev):**
    -   When asked about making a brand new game for the N64, Kaze states, "It's not financially viable decision for me to make And I do have a family now that I need to provide for So I can't just fuck around with my time and do that." This highlights RTyI as a passion project rather than a commercial one.

## Key Quotes
-   "most of what i did off cam was actually fixing up course four i finished fixing up course four so it's ready for beta testing we're gonna send it off to be tested soon uh yeah i think this is pretty good now" - (Shows progress and milestones)
-   "Dude, that's actually so freeing that we have hashing tables now instead of normal geo layouts, because now we have so much more space for geos. We can actually have up to model ID 0x60, which is insane, dude." - (Highlights technical advancements and Kaze's enthusiasm for them)
-   "But not every enemy has to be like a super obstacle, right? It's fine if he's more optical than or vibe-giving than dangerous. He's still gonna affect gameplay. I think he's fine." - (Insight into game design philosophy for enemy roles)
-   "I will definitely open sources like no worry This is guaranteed open source I want people to be able to maintain this code base after I leave the scene And I want other people to be able to make hex off of my engine" - (Clear statement on the game's future and community contribution)
