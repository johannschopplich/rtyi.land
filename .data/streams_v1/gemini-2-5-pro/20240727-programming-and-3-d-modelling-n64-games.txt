## Game Development Process
- The game, "Return to Yoshi's Island," is in a late stage of development, with Kaze working on "course 13" and stating "then it's just two levels missing."
- Significant time is spent on bug fixing and performance optimization, with Kaze mentioning he "almost finished my to-do list regarding bugs and performance issues."
- Development includes creating new features like anti-aliasing and achieving "infinite drawing distance even on 64" for certain levels.
- Kaze regularly tests the game on actual N64 hardware to assess performance and identify hardware-specific bugs (e.g., a pipe that "never worked on N64" now functions).
- The current focus for "course 13" (an icy castle/snowman path level) is on finalizing platforming, with aesthetic work and bug fixing to follow off-stream. Kaze hopes to "finish this level in the next month or so."

## Personal Insights
- Kaze expresses significant pride and satisfaction in his work, stating, "I'm especially so happy with oilyboilybay" and, somewhat hyperbolically about the game's quality, "Yes, somehow I'm more proud of this than of the child. What can I say? I'm an artist."
- He has a strong artistic philosophy: "I think a better way is you think about what feeling do I want to create and then you look at your tools and you look at how you can use your tools to create that feeling. You don't want to operate on principles because if you operate on principles, you make art for critics, you don't make art for the sake of it being experienced."
- Kaze values creative freedom, suggesting ROM hacks can be "a little more creative" than mainstream games because "RomEx don't have to sell well."
- He is confident in his technical abilities, often stating he can fix issues or "invent a solution" for technical challenges.

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub (composer):** No specific mention of Badub's contributions to "Return to Yoshi's Island" in this transcript. Kaze discusses music implementation generally (MIDI, MP3/WAV imports, ADPCM).
- **Biobak (graphics artist):** Biobak is credited with ideas and models, such as the Fuzzies in protective gear: "This was Biobak's idea and Biobak made the model." Kaze also acknowledges Biobak's artistic contributions when discussing level aesthetics ("Maybe you like Biobak's part more than mine").
- **Zeina (animations):** Known for animations (as per prompt). In this transcript, Zeina (Kaze's partner) is mentioned in a personal context (e.g., "She is currently upstairs with Zeina's mom," "Do you think our daughter will be able to play Super Mario Star World? I'm sorry Zeina."). Her specific animation contributions to "Return to Yoshi's Island" are not detailed in this segment.
- **Other Contributors:**
    - An unnamed "guy editing my last video" (a technical video about render matrices).

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Camera Issues:** Large levels can cause camera problems ("I think this level is a little too big and that's why the camera does this... I might have to invent a solution to that problem"). This was addressed by "bring[ing] everything in a little bit. So that the camera issue doesn't pop up."
- **Level Design and Flow:** Kaze actively refines platforming sections to improve gameplay feel, e.g., adjusting snowman obstacles ("These ones should probably be a little more parallel to each other. Because the wall kicks are otherwise a bit awkward") and re-evaluating jumps ("I'm not sure if I like this jump either. It's not a difficult jump, but it's a little awkward").
- **Technical Limitations:** Encountering issues with existing tools, such as a "snow combiner" for textures in the ice level ("this snow combiner is way too messed up to work with I'm gonna have to make up something new").
- **Performance on N64:** Constantly monitoring and optimizing framerate, and adding features like anti-aliasing while aiming for good performance on original hardware.
- **Balancing Difficulty:** Adjusting level elements to ensure they are challenging but fair (e.g., "Considering that this is too difficult. Let's make it easier").

## Business Aspects
- **Marketing/Promotion:** Kaze uses his technical streams and videos as a way to preview game progress: "So whenever I make a preview, it's like Look how I used this new feature on the N64 to make this level... I have to let people know that I'm still making progress on the hack."
- **Release Plans:** He intends to release the game directly and states, "No, my game never will show up in F3."
- **Monetization/Distribution:** Kaze clarifies he is "not allowed to sell real cartridges." However, he plans to "make a box and a book inlet without any Nintendo references to it and put that out so you can at least get the box as a souvenir." He anticipates "illegally manufactured cartridges by other people" might become available.
- **Addressing C&D Concerns:** Kaze dismisses the idea that showing fan games leads to C&D notices from Nintendo, arguing against self-censorship: "If you make a fan game and you shut up about it and you don't show anyone, you CND'd yourself. Why are you doing Nintendo's job for them?"

## Key Quotes
- "This is what the N64 games could have looked like. You were robbed. With all these options, too." - Kaze, on the enhanced visual capabilities of his hack running on N64.
- "I think a better way is you think about what feeling do I want to create and then you look at your tools and you look at how you can use your tools to create that feeling." - Kaze, on his game design and art philosophy.
- "I hope I can finish this level in the next month or so and then it's just two levels missing. Guys, can you imagine?" - Kaze, on the progress of "Return to Yoshi's Island."
