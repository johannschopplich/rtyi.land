## Game Development Process
- **Current Focus:** Development is centered on a new level called "Astral Arcade."
- **Stage of Development:** Kaze mentions, "We now finally have a plan for the level and we can start 3D modeling." This indicates a transition from planning to asset creation and implementation for this specific level.
- **Overall Project Progress:** Kaze confirms that "All the other courses are finished now? Yes," suggesting the game is in a later stage, with focus on adding new content or polishing existing areas.
- **Daily Goals:** A typical stream goal is "to 3d model and program the flippers hopefully," showing a hands-on approach to creating and implementing game elements.
- **Iterative Workflow:** The stream shows Kaze actively modeling, texturing, and problem-solving elements for the Astral Arcade, such as various pinball-inspired "flipper pieces." This includes brainstorming ideas, creating initial versions, critiquing them, and iterating on the design.

## Personal Insights
- **Self-Perception on Skills:** Kaze states, "Programming is not something I had to learn I keep saying and people keep saying some bullshit, but I say I was really just born with the ability to program I just had to learn the grammar." This highlights his confidence in his core abilities.
- **Dealing with Online Feedback:** He mentions, "So I don't know what it is, but recently I've been getting so much more annoyed at like my YouTube comments and stuff It's kind of not good." This offers a glimpse into the pressures or downsides of being a public creator.
- **General Opinions/Hot Takes:** Kaze frequently shares strong, sometimes controversial opinions on various topics, such as his views on Dragon Ball Super or philosophy: "And that is that every philosophical question is easy to answer. People are just hiding behind the grammar to make it sound like they're interesting questions, but they really are not."
- **Creative Frustration:** He openly expresses when he's unhappy with his work, e.g., "Damn, how do I make this pretty... holy shit this just looks so bad."

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub:** No relevant information found in this transcript regarding Badub (composer).
- **Biobak (Graphics Artist):**
    - Kaze mentions receiving textures: "I have these textures wise guy sent them to me" (Wise Guy is a known alias for Biobak).
    - Kaze anticipates Biobak's involvement in refining visuals: "I'm sure I'm Biobak [likely Biobak] will improve this anyway, and for now."
- **Zeina (Animator):** No relevant information found in this transcript regarding Zeina.
- **Other Contributors:** No other *new* contributors specifically for "Return to Yoshi's Island" are explicitly named and detailed in this transcript.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Level Concept (Astral Arcade):**
    - The level is an "arcade in space."
    - Design philosophy: "This level is gonna have a mario galaxy type design philosophy basically Feel open but be linear which we do by like having a bunch of random linear paths that somewhat intersect."
    - Layout: "We have the main area and below the main area is all the flipper pieces... all the pieces are going to be like floating around here. And they are going to be more like disconnected pieces than a whole flipper machine."
- **Gameplay Elements (Flipper Pieces):**
    - Brainstorming various types: rotating flipper, spherical bumper, triangular bumper, wormhole, speed stripes (though unsure how to implement in 3D), trampoline button.
    - 3D Constraints: "We have to keep in mind that the ones we make have to work in 3D space, so we can't do all of this [referring to some 2D pinball mechanics]."
- **Design Challenges:**
    - **Spherical Bumper Visuals/Functionality:** Kaze struggles significantly with making the spherical bumper look like it would "bump" the player and appear visually appealing: "how do we make a sphere that looks like it pushes you away when you jump into it is it even possible." He iterates through many ideas (textures, shapes, effects).
    - **Texture Issues:** "I think this looks just so jpeg artifacted how did it happen why is this so jpeg artifact it did I'm garbage with textures holy shit this just looks so bad."
    - **Adapting 2D Concepts:** Finding ways to make pinball elements work effectively and intuitively in a 3D environment.
- **Solutions/Ideas:**
    - For the spherical bumper, he eventually moves towards an idea involving a core with springs, or a half-sphere.
    - For the trampoline piece, he designs a glowing, button-like object.

## Business Aspects
- **Monetization/Distribution of the Game:**
    - Kaze is aware of legal issues with selling ROM hacks: "I can't give people access because like if I did it via patreon or something I would basically be selling access to the game which would be really bad legally speaking."
- **Streaming Sponsorships:**
    - Kaze discusses and interacts with sponsor offers live on stream. Examples include:
        - "Smacking Sunflower Seeds": "They gave me free sunflower seeds... 20% commission on every sale you refer exclusive 10% discount..."
        - "Intimately" (custom sex toy company): He shares a humorous and bizarre sponsorship request email from them.
    - He jokes about doing a video with an excessive number of sponsors: "Like a whole video that's just like 15 ads in a row."

## Key Quotes
- "We're gonna be working on the Astral Arcade We now finally have a plan for the level and we can start 3D modeling." (Shows clear project progression and focus)
- "We have to keep in mind that the ones we make have to work in 3D space, so we can't do all of this." (Highlights a core design constraint and challenge)
- "This level is gonna have a mario galaxy type design philosophy basically Feel open but be linear..." (Explains the guiding design principle for the Astral Arcade)
- "I can't give people access because like if I did it via patreon or something I would basically be selling access to the game which would be really bad legally speaking." (Clarifies his stance on monetizing ROM hacks)

## Potential Interview Topics
1.  **Astral Arcade - Conceptualization to Realization:** Explore the journey of the "Astral Arcade" level from its initial concept (pinball in space, Mario Galaxy philosophy) to the practical challenges of designing and implementing its unique 3D mechanics.
2.  **The Art of 3D Pinball in a Mario World:** Discuss the specific creative and technical hurdles in adapting 2D pinball ideas into a functional and fun 3D experience within the Mario 64 engine, particularly regarding player feedback and visual communication of mechanics.
3.  **Collaborative Dynamics in ROM Hacking:** Delve into the workflow and creative interplay between Kaze and his key collaborators (Biobak for graphics, and potentially Badub for music, Zeina for animations if they are involved as presumed), and how their contributions shape the final game.
4.  **Kaze's Development Ethos and the ROM Hacking Community:** Discuss how Kaze's distinct development philosophy, confidence, and candid online persona influence his project, and his views on the broader N64 ROM hacking scene, its limitations, and its creative potential.
5.  **Navigating Creativity and Constraints:** How does Kaze balance ambitious design goals with the technical limitations of the N64 platform and the legal/ethical considerations of ROM hacking, especially concerning distribution and community engagement?
