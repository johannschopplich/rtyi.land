## Game Development Process
- The game is in its later stages of development, with Kaze stating, "I think I'm almost done with the game, too."
- Specific progress mentioned: "only two areas are missing in this level and they're gonna be for the last star and the last few Yoshi coins."
- Overall remaining work: "we got four courses left after this and some side levels."
- The current focus is on an underground area for an oil rig level, involving platforming, collectibles (Yoshi coins, 8-bit pipe), and connecting different entrances.
- Kaze mentions an iterative approach: "We make a block out first and then we just put on a material and it will be something."
- Technical aspects like custom decompression are used to manage loading times on the N64 hardware: "we just load... And we decompress, which takes longer. And instead of waiting 16 frames, we just wait 8 frames. And the loading time is the same."

## Personal Insights
- Kaze reflects on his design intuition: "something about this feels weird anyone else feel like this feels weird right now maybe I'm being crazy."
- He has a pragmatic approach to coding behaviors: "I'd rather just have one parameter open like I do for 255 different behaviors I can hardcode because it is so rare that I want a special behavior like that."
- He is conscious of game difficulty based on past feedback: "usually when you make a romhack the criticism is always it's too difficult so i've gotten very wary of difficult i have been trying to make my games easier and easier."
- On his programming style (jokingly): "Mostly in English, but sometimes in C." This implies a high-level conceptual approach generally, with deep dives into C for optimization or specific needs.
- He acknowledges the impact of memory and context on his work: "so for me looking at this now this is this is talking about sports and finding a good sport but there is none that's what i think of when i see this and it will be forever like that i have way too good of a memory and it's cursing me."
- Kaze shows pride in the engine's capabilities: "I am thinking of porting just Delphino Plaza over to this engine and put it on the N64 and be like look the N64 could have played Mario Sunshine. Just to fuck with everyone. I think it'd be a very powerful showcase of the engine."

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub**: The composer for the game.
    - "Badub is also making a song for the oil bus that's like this it's fit to the cutscene."
- **Biobak (referred to as "buy a bike" or "Biobak" in transcript errors)**: Handles graphics, textures, and props. Kaze defers to his artistic judgment.
    - "I guess that's gonna be up to buy a bike but I thought it looked good." (re: texture work/props)
    - "I'll leave the exact details to you [Biobak] but I'll definitely put this in for now." (re: glass material for a window)
    - "Biobak will justify it in post. Alright. I will try to somehow justify it with a few materials, but I will leave the majority to you." (re: materials for the underground area)
- **Zeina (Zena)**: Involved in animations and is an active participant in the stream chat. Kaze consults her on creative aspects.
    - "hello Zena do you mean to make some stuff just a monkey animations" (Kaze asking Zena about animation work).
- **Other Contributors**:
    - **Yoshi Milkman**: Created detailed surface sound effects. "surface sounds yeah I'm made by Yoshi Milkman he put a lot of work into making this perfect."
    - **Duke**: Composed a song. "Duke made a song for it [buzzer t2]."
    - **Unnamed freelance artist**: Kaze puts out a request for an artist to create an oil-based enemy ("Frizzlet" type). "Actually, yes, I do. There's a lot of assets I need. Do you want to make some? I have an enemy in mind for this."

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Level Theming and Atmosphere**: Designing an underground oil rig area with "Big pipes and shit heavy metal leaking water boiling oil." Also, a concept for a transparent window to see platforms above.
- **Collectible Placement and Mechanics**:
    - "underground we need two Yoshi coins and the 8-bit pipe one Yoshi coin is going to be cleaning up another oil spot right here with a shell... and the other one is gonna be sliding down the slide and jumping into this crevice."
- **Platforming Design and Player Progression**:
    - "I need to make up a creative way to climb up here. I can't just do platforms." (Considering special platform types like dangling platforms or elevators).
    - Making certain platforms "slidey" to allow players to "practice the slidey skills beforehand."
- **Difficulty Balancing**: A significant consideration, especially for later levels.
    - "doesn't this jump feel a little too difficult? I mean, I know it's course 11... At some point, we have to draw a line."
    - He's trying to make the game easier based on past feedback for other ROM hacks.
- **Asset Creation and Selection**:
    - Kaze is looking for a freelancer to create a specific oil-based enemy.
    - He struggles with finding appropriate textures: "How is it so hard to find a good great texture?" and iterates on choices based on visual appeal and chat feedback ("Wow, this looks completely awful.").
- **Technical Limitations and Solutions**:
    - Designing within N64 texture limitations (e.g., 64x64 textures, specific formats). He advises a potential contributor: "just go with a full-res texture, whatever you think looks good, and then let me downscale it."
    - Rigging for characters/enemies has specific N64 requirements: "you should probably let me make the rig because N64 or Mario 64 has very specific requirements for the rig."

## Business Aspects
- **YouTube as a Promotional Platform**: Kaze actively uses his YouTube channel to showcase development and engage with the community.
    - "when you make a YouTube video you have to find the angle... I think I'm gonna frame it as like look with all this optimization artists have so much more freedom... it's gonna be the angle."
    - He monitors channel performance: "my youtube channel is on an upwards draft."
- **Audience Engagement**: Kaze is aware of viewer numbers and interaction on his streams.
    - "dude we have 64 viewers today that's nice we're making viewers on youtube again."
- **No Direct Monetization Mentioned**: The transcript does not contain information about funding, sales plans, or traditional release strategies for "Return to Yoshi's Island." The project appears to be passion-driven.

## Key Quotes
- "I think I'm almost done with the game, too." (Kaze on overall progress)
- "when you make a YouTube video you have to find the angle... I think I'm gonna frame it as like look with all this optimization artists have so much more freedom and we brought more artists on board which is you and now the game is epic and amazing because we all these optimizations it's gonna be the angle." (Kaze on his YouTube strategy and the benefits of optimization)
- "usually when you make a romhack the criticism is always it's too difficult so i've gotten very wary of difficult i have been trying to make my games easier and easier." (Kaze on his evolving approach to game difficulty)
