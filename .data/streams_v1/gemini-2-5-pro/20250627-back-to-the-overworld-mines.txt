## Game Development Process
- The project is in a mature stage, with a focus shifting from individual level completion to programming the game's overworld.
- Course 2 is nearly complete, with off-stream work focused on bug-fixing and improvements.
- A significant milestone being started is the programming of the overworld, which will connect all the levels.
- A concrete progress metric is given: approximately 140 stars are "done" out of a new target of around 200.
- The team is implementing systems for game-wide progression, such as creating a new system for save flags to track events in the overworld.
- Regular development updates are planned in video format (e.g., "the missing link video") to keep the community informed.

## Personal Insights
- Kaze follows a development philosophy of preparing and improving tools before tackling a large task, which he likens to Abraham Lincoln's quote about "sharpening his axe" for four hours to cut down a tree in six.
- He expresses a preference for when advanced technology like AI was a niche topic for "nerds," disliking the "delusional and annoying" mainstream discourse around it.
- Kaze often approaches problems and fables with a contrarian, logic-based perspective, such as his analysis of "The Tortoise and the Hare," where he argues the tortoise's decision to race was initially delusional, regardless of the outcome.
- He demonstrates a strong commitment to the project's specific aesthetic, stating an enemy model "definitely looks like an enemy from a Yoshi game," which he sees as a high compliment and a core goal.

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub:** No relevant information found in this transcript.
- **Biobak (referred to as "Biobak"):** A graphics artist and/or level designer. He is currently reworking a stage to be a "smaller mission." Kaze is careful not to interfere with his work-in-progress.
- **Zeina (referred to as "Zena"):** An animator. She is currently working on an animation for a "ball breaking scene."
- **Other Contributors:**
    - **Kyle:** A video editor who is creating "the missing link" video, a development update for the game.
    - **DeathWizard:** Mentioned as a highly knowledgeable but secretive peer in the N64 modding community who has often solved complex problems years before others.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Scope Creep:** The game's total star count has increased from a planned 185 to 193, with Kaze anticipating it will reach an even 200 as more ideas are implemented.
- **Player's First Experience:** There is a detailed debate on how the player should access the first level. The initial idea of a "Pachyderm" enemy requiring 10 coins was discarded after feedback that it might feel like a chore. The new concept is a more dynamic intro cutscene where the player's boat is destroyed by a "Napi-Nut" enemy, forcing them to swim to shore and organically learn controls while seeing the entire island.
- **Split-Screen Multiplayer:** This is a major, ambitious feature being seriously considered. Key design challenges identified include:
    - How to handle dialogue freezes (suggestion: full screen for both players).
    - How to manage single-player-only sections (suggestion: players swap on taking damage).
    - How to handle interactions that require one specific brother (suggestion: use the closest player).
    - Significant performance concerns, with an estimated drop to 20 FPS on the N64, which Kaze deems potentially acceptable.
- **Overworld Design:** The goal is to encourage immediate exploration. The design should give players "hooks" and show them locations to explore later, even before they enter the first course, to build anticipation.

## Business Aspects
- **Marketing:** The primary form of marketing mentioned is community-focused update videos, such as "the missing link video," which details game design and progress.
- **Monetization/Funding:** No relevant information found. The project is presented as a passion project/ROM hack with no commercial intent discussed.

## Key Quotes
- "Basically, if he had six hours to cut down a tree, he would spend four hours sharpening his axe... That's kind of what we're doing. We try to improve our tools, gather as much knowledge as possible, and then start the task so we can finish the task as fast as possible."
- "I think I really, really want the player to collect 10 coins. I think it does a lot for the game... [After feedback] I see a point of it being somewhat of a chore. That thought does make sense to me... Okay, in that case I am fine with a different way to open it."
- "My idea is, we have the intro cutscene... a Napi-Nut just fucking munches your boat and Mario jumps off. And lands in the water here... And then you just swim. I think that works."

## Potential Interview Topics
- **The "Sharpening the Axe" Philosophy:** Explore Kaze's approach to tool-driven development. How has investing time in creating or improving tools for this project saved time or enabled new creative possibilities in the long run?
- **Managing Ambition and Scope:** Discuss the balance between ambitious ideas like split-screen multiplayer and the practical need to complete the project. What is his process for deciding if a feature is worth the potential "scope creep" and development cost?
- **Player Onboarding and The Intro:** Delve into the design evolution of the game's first 15 minutes. What are the most important feelings and information he wants to convey to the player immediately, and how did the "Napi-Nut intro" concept better serve those goals than the original "Pachyderm toll"?
- **Collaborative Creation in ROM Hacking:** How does the remote collaboration with artists like Biobak and Zeina work? How are tasks assigned, and how much creative freedom do they have in interpreting the "Yoshi's Island" aesthetic?
- **The Line Between Homage and Originality:** The game is a hack of Mario 64 and a love letter to Yoshi's Island. How does he navigate the creative space between these two inspirations to create something that feels both familiar and new?
