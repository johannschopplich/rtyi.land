## Game Development Process
- The game is planned to have 15 courses in total. The stream focuses heavily on "Course 15," described as a "Space Arcade" and one of the final levels.
- Kaze states, "Game is nearly finished. We are getting there."
- Significant progress includes overhauling Mario's animation system for better consistency.
- The hub world is planned but will be developed "at the end."
- After Course 15, Kaze mentions needing to complete the Overworld, the Bowser level, and "three side levels missing if you include the Bowser one."
- A "bomb cap level" (likely an existing course or area) is undergoing a significant rework, with Kaze integrating changes from a collaborator (Biobak).
- Debugging technical issues, particularly collision map problems and game crashes in the reworked bomb cap level, is a current focus.

## Personal Insights
- Kaze values "crazy ideas" in game design but also emphasizes consistency: "It's not necessarily about what's fun, but rather what's consistent with the rest of the game."
- He expresses frustration with technical limitations and bugs but is persistent in solving them: "Man, this is such a difficult level to map out... I think my main problem is that I don't like the color palette we have." Later, "I'm just going to finish the collision map. We have to do that anyway. And if it still doesn't work, then we can figure it out."
- He has strong opinions on other games, e.g., "Fuck Yoshi's Island DS," and believes Twilight Princess feels "unfinished," indicating a critical and analytical approach to game design.
- Kaze reflects on his own creative process and vision: "I had an idea that is so good. You will love it. I have to do this. You will see this and shit your pants."
- He acknowledges the iterative nature of development: "A lot of it was collision mapping. I haven't spent much time figuring out the crash at all. I've just been doing other useful things that might be solving the thing."
- On working in a large company vs. independently: "In a big company, the way you work is very different from what I do here. What I do here is basically I call all the shots... I wouldn't be able to just make a full game if I was working at like a company like that."

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub (composer):** No direct mention of Badub or specific contributions to RTYI's music in this transcript. Kaze does say, "Oh, we already have the music in," for one level, and later asks chat for "OST wishes," implying he handles some music selection/integration.
- **Biobak (graphics artist):** Heavily involved in the visual rework of the "bomb cap level." Kaze reviews Biobak's updated models, textures, and lighting, providing feedback and making adjustments. Examples: "Oh, this is already a sick texture I'm seeing. Let's see what we've got. All right. General. Fine. Update the lighting. Textures and some geo." and "This is a really nice idea though, holy shit" (referring to a texture). Biobak also had the idea for "Biobak's window idea, a hit the lights type game" for Course 15.
- **Zeina (animations):** Mentioned once in a personal, non-work-related anecdote: "Zaina sometimes makes the bed..." No specific contributions to "Return to Yoshi's Island" are detailed in this transcript, though Kaze mentions earlier overhauling Mario's animation system himself.
- **Other Contributors:**
    - **Spiralback:** Credited with the idea for Course 15's central feature: "This is Spiralbacks idea. A giant rocket that's the casino."
    - **Arthur Tilley:** Credited with an idea for a star in Course 15: "this last bit pipe, this was Arthur Tilley's idea, it takes you to Mario 64."
    - **Chat members (Lila, Davy, etc.):** Provide real-time feedback and suggestions, some of which Kaze acknowledges or incorporates (e.g., noting down a to-do item based on Davy's suggestion for a seven-segment counter).

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Course 15 (Space Arcade) Design:**
    - Theme: An arcade in space, not a casino, with a "big rocket in the middle" (Spiralback's idea).
    - Star Concepts: Ideas include a whack-a-mole game, a rhythm game, a Skee-Ball game (shooting a cannon), a pinball-themed platforming section (inspired by Casino Night Zone), and a "bit pipe" leading to a Mario 64 retro section (Arthur Tilley's idea).
    - Additional Arcade Game Ideas: A "dumbed down version of Star Fox 64," a "hit the lights type game," "walk over pixel art to turn on all the pixels," and a memory-based path.
    - Aesthetic Challenges: Kaze struggles with the color palette ("Something about the color palette here just doesn't feel right to me") and visual elements like "ugly arcade carpet."
- **Mario 64 Retro Section (Star 6 of Course 15):**
    - Concept: Short sections or "chunks referencing parts of Mario 64 levels," not full remakes, presented as a "combined diorama."
    - Art Style: Aims to make them "prettier" than original SM64 visuals with "proper lighting" and better texture use, while still evoking the original art style.
    - Purpose: To create a contrast with RTYI levels and appeal to players who grew up with SM64.
- **Technical Challenges:**
    - Rendering: Experimenting with effects like "additive color" and dealing with rendering order for visual elements.
    - Collision and Performance: Significant time spent debugging collision map issues in the reworked "bomb cap level," leading to crashes due to data overflow or actor limits. Kaze works on optimizing triangle counts.
    - Tooling Bugs: A suspected bug in "Fast64" (an exporting tool) affecting texture display, requiring workarounds.
- **Gameplay Mechanics:**
    - Low gravity zones planned for the bomb cap level.
    - Discussion on how to make a "bomb cap tutorial" immediately obvious to players.
    - General philosophy: "You want to add mechanics to present interesting concepts to the player, not just for the sake of adding more mechanics."
    - Three "Yoshi stars" (like green stars) per main level.

## Business Aspects
- No direct mentions of marketing, funding, or specific release/distribution plans for "Return to Yoshi's Island."
- Kaze mentions he will "make the board public" (likely referring to the game's assets or source for others to use/learn from), which could be seen as a form of community engagement or distribution of resources.

## Key Quotes
- "Game is nearly finished. We are getting there. It is not a casino. It is an arcade." (Progress and theme clarification)
- "This is the best idea. I think I told you guys. There was a guy that wanted to give us better internet... Now, they have dropped their router into our basement. I haven't signed the contract. I'm not paying for that." (Illustrative of Kaze's personality and problem-solving, albeit unrelated to game dev directly).
- "Star six, of course, is a bit pipe. And I'm thinking this last bit pipe, this was Arthur Tilley's idea, it takes you to Mario 64. And we're going to make very short sections of a bunch of Mario 64 levels. And I think the contrast between Mario 64 levels and RTYI levels is going to be beautiful at display here." (Key design decision for a major level feature).
- "It's not necessarily about what's fun, but rather what's consistent with the rest of the game. If something is so different from the rest of the game, then like, you're going to limit the amount of players that enjoy your game, I guess." (Kaze's design philosophy).
- "The problem is the collision map. The engine by default can only handle like, I think like 5,000 collisions in the collision map. And because I haven't made a collision map yet, it's like 8,000 almost?" (Highlighting a major technical challenge).

## Potential Interview Topics
- The collaborative process with artists like Biobak: How are ideas exchanged, feedback given, and assets integrated, especially when working remotely or asynchronously?
- The design philosophy behind the Mario 64 retro section: How do you balance homage with innovation, and what challenges arise in "prettifying" iconic but dated visuals while retaining their essence?
- Overcoming technical hurdles: Can you elaborate on the most significant technical challenges faced (like collision limits or rendering) while pushing the boundaries of the Mario 64 engine with the decompilation project?
- The role of community input (e.g., from Spiralback, Arthur Tilley, chat) in shaping level design and features in "Return to Yoshi's Island."
- Kaze's overall vision for "Return to Yoshi's Island": What experience does he hope to deliver to players, and what does this project personally mean to him as a creator in the ROM hacking scene?
- The decision to "overhaul Mario's animation system": What prompted this, what were the goals, and what impact does he feel it has on the gameplay experience?
