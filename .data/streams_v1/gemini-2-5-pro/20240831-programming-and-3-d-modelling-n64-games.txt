## Game Development Process
- **Overall Progress:** Significant progress made, particularly in the castle area where all platforming is complete. The current focus is shifting towards visual polish ("make the castle look good") and technical optimization.
- **Major Milestones:**
    - Completion of platforming logic within the game's castle.
    - Ongoing integration and optimization of the F3DX3 microcode, showing substantial performance improvements.
    - A demo for "Return to Yoshi's Island" is planned for release after an upcoming video edit is finished.
- **Development Stages:** The game appears to be past the core mechanics implementation for some areas and is now in a phase of level detailing, visual enhancement, asset creation/improvement, and deep technical optimization. Kaze mentions skipping a week of streams but has made "a lot of progress" since.

## Personal Insights
- **Kaze's Standards and Iteration:** Kaze is self-critical and iterative. "This room now looks decent. It's still not good, but it no longer looks like complete ass." He shows satisfaction in specific details: "I kind of like this ice carpet here. I think it's a nice touch."
- **Design Philosophy:** He considers player experience and difficulty, aiming for fairness even in challenging sections: "I think the difficulty here is appropriate for CoS 13." and when explaining safety nets for falls, "So I think it's fair."
- **Pride in Work:** He expresses satisfaction with successful creative and technical implementations: "Doing this combined I took a bit, but you see how it just disappears into the clouds here? I like that a lot."
- **Opinions on Game Development:** Kaze has strong opinions on game design and technical practices, as seen in his critiques of Rare's N64 optimization ("I'm about to fail a fucking QuickTime event and go on a full rant about how terrible Banjo-Kazooie optimizes") and Conker's Bad Fur Day.
- **Modding History:** He mentions his early modding experiences: "Did I make my first Mario 64 remake with Blender? Nope, I used Google Sketchup. It was not a good time."

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub (composer):** No relevant information found in this transcript.
- **Biobak (graphics artist):** No relevant information found in this transcript (chat user "Biobak" is present but not identified as the graphics artist).
- **Zeina (animator/artist, also Kaze's partner "Xena"):**
    - "Xena is actually working on some assets for it right now. It [the outside area] will be a little village with penguin huts."
    - Indicated to be Kaze's partner and new mother: "The baby is currently hanging out with her grandparents. Yeah, Xena is having a lot of fun with the baby."
- **Other Contributors:**
    - **Soren:** A key technical collaborator.
        - "This guy is Soren. He's working on a new microcode for the N64 called X3. F3DX3."
        - The latter half of the stream features an extensive technical discussion with Soren about implementing and optimizing F3DX3 for RTYI, focusing on performance gains, vertex buffers, and GBI (Graphics Binary Interface) changes.
    - **Lila:** A Fast64 developer.
        - "Hi, Lila. Lila is one of the fast 64 devs."
        - Actively participates in the chat during the F3DX3 discussion, offering technical insights and context related to Fast64.
    - **Kaze's Editor:**
        - "My editor has been on it for a week [working on a video]. And after that, it's going to be the demo."
    - **Vaisky / Mitten:**
        - Mentioned in the context of the Banjo-Kazooie decompilation project, with Vaisky making it "shiftable." This shows Kaze's connection to the broader N64 decomp community.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Level Design & Mechanics:**
    - Use of "pure white doors" to act as portals for room culling, optimizing rendering performance: "So by having a door like this, I can make it so that the room behind here doesn't render right now."
    - Implementing a "mirror... wallkick section. On the mirror. So it will look like you're punching wallkick mirror Mario."
    - Designing levels with intentional difficulty but also safety nets for players: "First of all, if you fall down here, you can still save yourself like this... There's a line of coins guiding you to safety."
    - Identifying need for asset improvement: "I also want a new grind animation here for Mario. The one we have right now is not it."
- **Technical Challenges & Solutions (Rendering, Performance):**
    - Managing render layers for transparency: "Layer 6 is transparent decals. Layer 5 was just transparent to invert the order. Because you have to render transparent stuff in Z order."
    - Extensive work on performance optimization through F3DX3 microcode with Soren, covering RSP/RDP bottlenecks, vertex buffer improvements, auto-batched rendering, and display list hints.
    - Debugging visual glitches like a stretched HP circle or corrupted text rendering with the new microcode.
    - Discussion on texture choices and their visual impact: "This texture here looks pretty poopy."
- **Scope:**
    - "How many stars in this? 7 stars, 12 levels, that's 84. And then a few extra, like 90, 100, something like that."

## Business Aspects
- **Release Plans:**
    - A demo of "Return to Yoshi's Island" is planned. "And after that [the video], it's going to be the demo."
    - No definitive final release date: "Can you tell me how long it will be before the final release? I don't know, honestly."
- **Marketing/Promotion:**
    - A video related to the game is being worked on by an editor.
    - The stream itself serves as a form of ongoing community engagement and progress update.
- **Funding:** No relevant information found (typical for ROM hack projects).

## Key Quotes
- **On development progress and standards:** "This room now looks decent. It's still not good, but it no longer looks like complete ass."
- **On technical collaboration for F3DX3's impact:** Kaze (to Soren, after seeing performance gains): "Oh my god RDP almost a full millisecond over a full millisecond okay well are you satisfied." Soren: "Oh yeah that's much better."
- **On game design ambition:** "And then right here, this will be a mirror. And there will be a wallkick section. On the mirror. So it will look like you're punching wallkick mirror Mario."
- **On the iterative nature and future plans:** "But I finished all the platforming inside the castle. Right now we just have to make the castle look good... And after that, it's going to be the demo."

## Potential Interview Topics
- **The Kaze & Soren Collaboration:** Explore the dynamic with Soren, the decision to integrate F3DX3, and the specific breakthroughs and challenges encountered while optimizing RTYI with this new microcode.
- **Kaze's Vision for RTYI:** Delve into his overarching creative goals for the game. What unique experience or feeling is he aiming to provide players, and how does it build upon or depart from the original Yoshi's Island or SM64?
- **Balancing Innovation and N64 Limitations:** Discuss Kaze's process for designing innovative mechanics (like the mirror wallkick) while navigating the N64's technical constraints, and how tools like the SM64 decompilation and F3DX3 enable/challenge this.
