## Game Development Process
- Currently working on "Course 11 at 13 the ice castle" and an enemy called "the freezy."
- Recently completed work on an "oil level" and a new video.
- The game is planned to have 15 main courses. Kaze mentions being "in quest 13 out of 15," indicating significant progress on core level creation, but also states the project will likely take "two years or so" more to complete.
- Development involves level design, enemy mechanics (e.g., Freezy's ice breath), visual effects (spline lights, particles), UI optimization, and significant bug fixing.
- A new feature, "spline light," was recently implemented and showcased.
- Kaze is actively uploading ROMs to an N64 for testing, though sometimes encounters crashes.

## Personal Insights
- Kaze values player experience and "feel" highly, as seen in his deliberation over the dive mechanic: "I agree it feels really good... I think that might still feel good and be like more in line with with the rest of the game."
- He aims for a game where players can "pick your own difficulty where you can go for risky jumps and like do the difficult thing or you can do the easy thing whenever you want."
- He expresses frustration with aspects of development ("This really really sucks" regarding a bug) but also excitement for new creations ("Isn't that fucking sick?" about spline lights).
- He is preparing for fatherhood, with his daughter Reyna due in four weeks, which will involve parental leave and potentially more streaming.
- Kaze reflects on his creative process for videos: "My engine is mostly I'm gonna be moving to one level design one of these. I know is what you give for making a collect-a-thon Stunning adventure is all about freedom..."

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub:** No relevant information found in this transcript.
- **Biobak (Graphics Artist):**
    - Contributed ideas for visual elements, such as "how the dots move depending on how the platform moves that was Biobak's idea."
    - Kaze values Biobak's art style: "I just kind of tried to do it in the style that Biobak was making the stuff but I Think you could probably make it look better."
    - Collaborates on aesthetic ideas, e.g., Biobak suggested putting Z and R on caps for Zeina and Reyna.
- **Zeina (Animations, close associate):**
    - Joined the stream call. The name of Kaze's upcoming daughter, Reyna, is in homage to a friend of Zeina's who passed away.
    - Kaze mentions, "We always name ourselves KaZeina in video games," indicating a close bond. Specific contributions to "Return to Yoshi's Island" are not detailed in this segment.
- **Other Contributors:**
    - **Dan:** "Dan even helped me look into this a little bit to get a proper effect going" (referring to a wall effect).
    - **"Salvato" (Game Designer):** Kaze mentions discussing game design with him previously regarding Mario 64's dive mechanic, indicating Kaze seeks external design perspectives.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Dive Mechanic Re-evaluation:** Kaze is considering nerfing Mario's dive by limiting angle changes to make it less of a "trivializing" mechanic for level design, while still feeling good. He states, "the logic goes through the dive you are kinda making a lot of level design trivial."
- **Star Count and Variety:** The game is planned to have around 180 stars. This includes ~130 main stars, Overworld stars, "Yoshi missions" (e.g., timed challenges, limited jumps, find a teddy bear, beat a level as Minamaru), and a potential "Emerald Hunt" style mission inspired by Sonic Adventure. Kaze is actively brainstorming and refining these: "See that's my issue. Trying to get Wonder Guns without dying in a level."
- **Enemy Design (Freezy):** Developing the Freezy's ice breath attack, including visual effects for inhaling (sucking in snow) and exhaling (shooting ice). Iterating on particle effects to achieve the desired look (cone vs. cylinder, type of particles).
- **Camera Issues:** Actively working to fix camera problems, e.g., "I should put like a hole in here so that when you do this the camera doesn't get fucky."
- **Bug Fixing:** Encountered and worked on several bugs during the stream, including a missing visual effect in the "factory" area and a ROM crash on boot.
- **Accessibility/Difficulty Modes:** Briefly discussed a "sightseeing mode" with no HP, or altering Mario's physics (slower, less gravity) for an easier experience, but leans towards players choosing their difficulty through gameplay choices rather than explicit modes: "I would want the difficulty selection to be like choose your own adventure where you just play the game and then you can make more difficult jumps."

## Business Aspects
- **Funding:** Acknowledges Patreon support ("Sub man I joined your patreon nice being gamer. That's cool").
- **Marketing/Community Engagement (YouTube):** Considers hiring a video editor ($16/minute) to increase his YouTube video output, which he sees as "hard bottlenecked by my unwillingness to make videos."
- **Release/Distribution Risks:** Jokes about Nintendo potentially trying to "arrest" him if offered a job, highlighting an awareness of the legal status of ROM hacks.

## Key Quotes
- "I want the game to not be difficult I want it to be like pick your own difficulty where you can go for risky jumps and like do the difficult thing or you can do the easy thing whenever you want it's kind of my thought process here." (Kaze on his game design philosophy for difficulty)
- "We're in quest 13 out of 15, so we're almost done already. Well, almost done. It's probably still going to be like two years or so, I don't know." (On project progress and timeline)
- "so recently I was talking to a different game designer than salvato you might know him and he was saying that he thinks that the dive is kind of antithetical to the rest of Mario 64 the ground pop dive here he really doesn't like it and I think I kind of see his point." (Showing reflection on core mechanics and external influences)

## Potential Interview Topics
- Explore Kaze's core design philosophy for "Return to Yoshi's Island," particularly his "pick your own difficulty" approach and how it's implemented in level and mission design.
- Discuss the collaborative process with key contributors like Biobak: How do they share ideas, iterate on designs, and resolve creative differences?
- Delve into the decision-making process behind major game mechanics, such as the planned changes to Mario's dive, and how community feedback influences these choices.
- Ask about the scope of the project, particularly the evolution of the star/mission system (Yoshi missions, Emerald Hunts), and the challenges of managing content for such an ambitious ROM hack.
- Inquire about the impact of the SM64 decompilation on the development of "Return to Yoshi's Island" and how it has enabled new creative possibilities or presented unique challenges.
