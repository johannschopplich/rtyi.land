## Game Development Process
- The game "Return to Yoshi's Island" is actively being developed, with Kaze working on new areas and refining existing ones.
- A significant portion of development involves iteration; for example, an entire area ("Boring Red Coin Mission") was removed and is being remade based on playtester feedback indicating it wasn't fun.
- Kaze mentions the game has been at "80% [completion]" for a while due to ongoing changes and refinements to older content.
- Bug fixing is a crucial part of the process, including addressing complex engine-level crashes (e.g., an S8 register overwrite issue).
- New level concepts are being planned, such as "Quest 13," envisioned as an ice castle with a specific "gloomy but bright" aesthetic.
- Development includes creating and implementing new gameplay mechanics and visual elements for levels, such as moving platforms in an abandoned temple area.

## Personal Insights
- Kaze prioritizes "fun" in his game design, even if it means deviating from realism or conventional design ("Yeah, but it's fun. You know?").
- He has strong opinions on game design, critically evaluating existing genres and his own work to improve them (e.g., remaking a "boring" mission).
- Kaze expresses a personal aesthetic appreciation for elements he creates, such as lighting effects ("I really like the way the lighting fits in here when you go near the flames.").
- He suggests a focus on the creative process over universal accessibility or completion, stating, "I don't know if RTYL will be beatable. I'm not really considering that."
- He is open about his development process, including experimental optimizations ("I'm using a fucked up optimization that stores the current object pointer. In the FP register").

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub:** Not directly mentioned by name as a composer for RTYI in this transcript. Kaze discusses listening to "Fungi Mines OST" and liking its vibe, indicating he seeks music that aligns with his vision.
- **Biobak:** "I think Biobak also sometimes makes textures for the levels the team works on." Biobak contributes textures for the game.
- **Zeina:** "Oh yeah, Zeina also makes textures." and "Zayn just did a sign for a tumbleweed store... She also made two other ones... Koopa bank here... milk bar the milk bar sign is really good." Zeina contributes textures and specific art assets like signs for levels.
- **Other Contributors:**
    - **Sauron:** Mentioned in relation to "F3DX3 and RQIA," where Kaze is "still waiting for Sauron to make the final decisions on that." This implies Sauron has a role in technical decisions or feature development, possibly related to the underlying tools or engine components.
    - **Leela (Stream Chatter):** While not a formal collaborator in the same sense, Leela is a frequent interactor in the stream chat, engaging in discussions, debates (e.g., Wild West lighting), and providing a sounding board for Kaze.
    - **Simpleflips (Mentioned):** Kaze jokingly mentions an NDA with Simpleflips, suggesting Simpleflips might have early access for testing or promotion.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Technical Challenges:**
    - Debugging a significant crash caused by an "S8 register" being overwritten due to a custom optimization. Kaze identified the specific function causing the issue and worked on a fix.
    - Ensuring visual consistency and proper rendering, such as adding fog to moving platforms to make them look less out of place.
- **Level Design & Iteration:**
    - Removing and completely redesigning a "Boring Red Coin Mission" after playtesting revealed it wasn't fun, despite being "cute." The new design will still feature 8 red coins.
    - Adjusting difficulty: "I want this coin to be easier. I don't like how difficult it is to slide on here."
    - Designing new levels with specific themes and atmospheres, like "Quest 13" (ice castle, "gloomy but bright," "suspenseful").
    - Making aesthetic choices for level elements, like deciding that moving platforms should be brick and scuffed, rather than wooden.
- **Asset Creation/Sourcing:**
    - Textures are sourced from "random games," and Kaze "rarely make[s] textures" himself, relying on collaborators like Zeina and Biobak, or existing assets.
    - Integrating custom signs made by Zeina for a "Wild West" themed area.
- **Gameplay Mechanics:**
    - Implementing moving platforms and considering player interaction with them (e.g., "jump up there, which doesn't work because of the collision").

## Business Aspects
- **Content Distribution:** Kaze streams his development on his main channel, and VODs are uploaded to "CaseClips."
- **Engine Release:** Kaze states, "Then will the engine be open source yes it will be," indicating plans to release the modified game engine publicly.
- **Promotion/Marketing:** Kaze mentions a YouTube video he made about "invisible walls" is performing well, indicating an awareness of content creation for audience engagement.
- **Release Considerations (General):** For a separate "competition" project, Kaze mentions having to wait for it to be played on stream by "ASA" (or a similar name) before releasing it, showing external factors can influence release timing.

## Key Quotes
- "This is just a remake of an old level, or well, this is just, we're just remaking one area of an old level because I have watched playtesters play it and I realized this area fucking sucks. It was cute, yeah, but it wasn't very fun." (Illustrates iterative design based on playtesting and prioritizing fun.)
- "Quest 13 is going to be an ice castle. On top of a mountain. And it's going to be very gloomy and scary and dark. Or maybe more suspenseful... It was gonna be white and desaturated blues... So it would be pretty bright, but it would be scary and gloomy." (Highlights the conceptualization of new levels and specific atmospheric goals.)
- "Okay, so basically the bug here, the crash that we just ran into, is that it's using the S8 register... This function here decides to overwrite the S8 register with some random local variable. So my current object pointer gets overwritten..." (Shows the technical depth of development and bug-fixing involved.)
- "I don't know if RTYL will be beatable. I'm not really considering that." (Suggests Kaze's focus might be more on the creative vision and challenge than ensuring universal completion.)

## Potential Interview Topics
- **The Iterative Design Philosophy:** Explore Kaze's process for evaluating player feedback and his willingness to make drastic changes to levels (like the "Boring Red Coin Mission") to improve "fun." How does he balance his vision with external input?
- **Quest 13's Unique Aesthetic:** Delve deeper into the inspiration and intended player experience for the "gloomy but bright" ice castle. What specific feelings or challenges does he aim to evoke with this design?
- **Collaboration and Asset Integration:** Discuss how he works with contributors like Zeina and Biobak. How are art styles aligned, and how are assets integrated into the game to fit his overall vision?
- **Technical Innovation and Risk:** Elaborate on the "fucked up optimization" and other deep engine modifications. What are the benefits and challenges of pushing the SM64 engine this far, and how does it enable his creative goals for RTYI?
- **Open-Sourcing the Engine:** What are Kaze's motivations for planning to make the engine open source? What impact does he hope it will have on the Mario 64 modding community?
