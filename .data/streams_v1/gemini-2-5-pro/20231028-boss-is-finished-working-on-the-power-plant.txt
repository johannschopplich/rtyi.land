## Game Development Process
- The game is actively being developed, with Kaze mentioning, "since the last stream I made so many updates to this game."
- A significant performance improvement (10-15%) was recently achieved, primarily by changing how coins are rendered (from billboards to screen-space sprites). Kaze states, "At this stage, that is crazy. I don't think we will ever see another performance improvement this big. Until we implement F3DX3."
- Development is progressing on new levels, with "Course 11" (the power plant) being the current focus for design and implementation of new platforming mechanics.
- Kaze has a clear plan for the structure of new levels, for example, for the power plant: "I have all five sections here planned out and I have two rooms sketched."
- The game uses custom music: "all music in this game is custom so we're not reusing some other games music."
- There's an ongoing effort to improve visuals, with some levels being reworked by collaborators.
- The codebase uses some unique approaches, like a "tick function instead of a behavior loop" and a new way to declare variables that Kaze believes is "way more transparent."

## Personal Insights
- Kaze's primary motivation is creative expression and fun: "I'm not trying to send a message at all, I just want to make the funny Mario."
- Development is a passion project done in his spare time: "I have a full time job, I can't spend that much time working on this right now. Unfortunately." This impacts the development timeline.
- He has strong opinions on game design, preferring intrinsic rewards and innovative concepts over simple collection mechanics: "I want the game that rewards me with finding cool shit. I want to see cool concepts, not extrinsic motivation like, oh, number go up."
- Kaze expresses frustration with frequent questions about release dates, emphasizing an "it's done when it's done" philosophy.
- He sometimes struggles with the technical aspects of streaming (OBS issues, mouse problems) and physical discomfort (neck pain).
- Kaze seems to value responsiveness in controls: "I feel like that would make this less responsive. You know what I mean? It's kinda nice how responsive this is."

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub (composer):** No specific mention of "Badub" as the composer in this transcript. Kaze states all music is custom, and later mentions "Dumpy" (a composer for another project) and speculates about needing a new composer in the future, implying the current composer isn't named or he might be doing it himself.
- **Biobak (graphics artist, also referred to as Biobak/Biobak):**
    - Actively contributes design ideas: "I agree with Biobak's idea to make the soap go to the outside cages instead, though. I think that's a good change."
    - Kaze plans to delegate texture work to him for the power plant level: "I Will leave the textures to buy a bike [Biobak] but I will pick something for now that doesn't look completely awful at least."
    - Biobak also participates in community discussions, e.g., posting a "toaster speedrun."
- **Zeina (animations):**
    - Her role in animations is not detailed in this transcript.
    - She is mentioned in a personal context: "Zeina has banished me here [to the basement]. She said I'm not allowed to come up unless it's to grab food."
- **Other Contributors:**
    - **Nata (also referred to as Mata):** Tasked with reworking the visuals for the "bomb cap factory" level. "Nata wants to rework it. He's gonna have it finished by the start of June." However, Kaze expresses some doubt about the progress: "he is four months overtime on something that he said would take him two weeks. So my confidence in this is not very high." Kaze also mentions paying Nata for this commission.
    - **Yoshi Milkman:** Contributing new custom sound effects. "Dude, we're going to have Yoshi Milkman's new sound soon, actually... Yoshi Milkman made so many new sounds for Mario 64 that are going to be pretty good. It's going to make the game feel a little more immersive."

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Performance Optimization:** A major focus, exemplified by the coin rendering change (billboards to screen-space sprites) resulting in a 10-15% FPS boost in areas like "Bunny Brushworks."
- **Level Design (Power Plant - Course 11):**
    - Planned introduction of three new platform types: treadmills, dangling platforms, and collapsing grates, culminating in a final room that combines them.
    - A "weight platform" mechanic was developed during the stream, where one platform goes down as another goes up, based on Mario's position. This idea came from Biobak and was adopted: "I think we're going with that idea, yes. I like that."
    - Visual theme: Kaze is looking for an "abandoned power plant" vibe, referencing industrial imagery with pipe structures. He wants to avoid a "grainy" or "noisy" visual style.
- **Difficulty and Controls:** Aiming for a difficulty comparable to vanilla Mario 64, but acknowledging that the game's improved controls might make seemingly harder challenges more manageable. "Although, keep in mind, the controls in this work a lot better."
- **Black Boss (Course 11):** A boss fight where the boss is oil-slicked and rainbow-colored. Mechanics include running out of "soap" and dodging platforms. Kaze took Biobak's suggestion to change where the soap spawns.
- **New Star Model:** A new, non-transparent star model has been implemented, which Kaze believes is "a lot nicer than the transparent star in Vanilla Mar 64."
- **Implementing Platform Mechanics:** Kaze discusses the technical challenges of making dangling platforms move and interact realistically, considering animations vs. geo layouts. He also fine-tunes the physics of the weight platforms to make them feel responsive and useful for gameplay.

## Business Aspects
- **Release Date:** Kaze firmly states there are no release dates. "I'm not gonna guarantee any release dates... You're just gonna have to wait until it's done." He reiterates, "It's done when it's done."
- **Funding/Commissions:** Kaze mentions paying a collaborator: "See, the thing is, I paid him [Nata] to reorganize. He asked me for a commission because he needed some money." This is the only mention of financial transactions related to the game's development.
- **Marketing/Distribution:** No direct mentions of marketing plans or distribution strategies. The project appears to be a passion-driven endeavor shared via streams.
