## Game Development Process
-   **Current Focus:** Development is actively progressing, with specific attention on a level featuring an oil rig where Bowser's minions are protesting. This includes creating character animations (Wiggler, Thwomps, Koopas, Goomba), enemy behaviors, dialogue, and level geometry (Bowser's office tower).
-   **Major Milestones/Tasks:**
    *   Animating Wiggler (a difficult animation due to its rigging).
    *   Designing and implementing a "protest" scene with multiple characters, unique animations (hopping, anger), and dialogue.
    *   Refining textures for characters like Thwomps (iterating from "poop-like" to "oily/rusty" or "stone").
    *   Modeling and texturing new assets like an "Oil Block" character and Bowser's office tower.
    *   Optimizing performance for N64, achieving ~25-29 FPS in demanding areas, and implementing techniques like pop-in hiding.
    *   Scripting a multi-act mission structure for the protest level, culminating in a boss fight.
    *   Designing the interior of Bowser's office, including an elevator sequence and a secret Yoshi coin.
-   **Development Stages:** The game appears to be in a mid-to-late stage of development for certain levels, with core mechanics established and content creation (levels, enemies, story sequences) being the primary activity. Polishing and bug-fixing are also occurring (e.g., performance improvements).
-   **Tools:** Blender for 3D modeling and animation, ChatGPT for initial dialogue generation, and custom tools for N64 development.

## Personal Insights
-   **Creative Aspirations:** Kaze expressed wanting a "Tiny Huge Island" type level with a concept like "ice and fire" but struggled to find a decent idea. He also has a future ambition to develop an Ocarina of Time hack using a "professional game studio" model.
-   **Design Philosophy:**
    *   Prefers replayability through player skill improvement and discovering shortcuts over unlockable "new game plus" content.
    *   Enjoys incorporating humor and unique gameplay moments (e.g., the protest, squished dialogue box for a flattened Goomba).
    *   Values the iterative process and is open to changing designs based on feedback or new ideas.
-   **Reflections on Process:** Kaze acknowledges the difficulty of certain tasks (Wiggler animation, coming up with title screen ideas). He seems to enjoy the problem-solving aspect and engaging with his community for feedback and ideas. He finds the idea of developing an OoT hack with a structured team "very fun."

## Collaborator Information
-   **Badub (Composer):** Implied to be the composer for the game's OST. A viewer (TJ) had "OST wishes," suggesting music is an ongoing part of development.
-   **Biobak (Graphics Artist/Ideas):**
    *   Contributes textures (e.g., an "oil texture").
    *   Kaze sends him models (e.g., the "oil block") for Biobak to potentially work on or get ideas from.
    *   Actively suggests dialogue lines for the protesting characters, with Kaze noting his suggestions are often better than ChatGPT's.
-   **Zeina (Animations):**
    *   Working on complex character animations, specifically mentioned for Wiggler's walk cycle.
    *   Provided several animations for a Goomba character (sitting, falling, a protest hop). Kaze reviews and integrates her work.
-   **Other Contributors:**
    *   **NepEnet / CaprentorBlog:** Credited for a fire sound effect used in the game.
    *   **Chat Community:** While not formal collaborators, various viewers (e.g., "Lula," "Stoke," and others unnamed) provide real-time feedback, suggestions for dialogue, and critiques that Kaze actively engages with and sometimes incorporates.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
-   **Key Design Choices:**
    *   Implementing a "protest" scene where Bowser's minions strike against him, with unique animations and dialogue.
    *   Making the dialogue box for a flattened Goomba character also appear squished for comedic effect.
    *   Designing a multi-stage boss encounter introduction for Act 3 of the protest level, involving entering Bowser's office, an environmental change (protesters disappear, music stops), and then an ambush.
    *   Including a secret Yoshi coin in Bowser's tower, accessible by escaping an elevator shaft.
    *   Focusing on N64 authenticity, including performance targets and visual styles.
    *   Planning for multiplayer functionality post-Quaternion animations.
-   **Obstacles Faced & Solutions:**
    *   **Wiggler Animation Rigging:** The root bone placement on Wiggler's chest makes animation difficult. Kaze and Zeina are working through this, with Kaze attempting to animate segment by segment.
    *   **Thwomp Textures:** Initial criticism of Thwomp textures looking like "poop." Iterated towards "oily and rusty" or "stone," with Kaze creating new textures based on feedback.
    *   **N64 Performance:** Managing FPS in large, detailed levels. Achieved by optimizing, using culling (including backface culling considerations), and designing pop-in hiding animations.
    *   **Dialogue Writing:** Used ChatGPT as a starting point for protester dialogue, then refined it with community input (especially from Biobak) to make it funnier and more fitting.
    *   **Star Select Screens:** Finding it "a bit much" to create 15 custom star select screens.
    *   **Conceptualizing Levels:** Difficulty in coming up with a "decent" idea for a "tiny huge island" type level beyond the basic gimmick.

## Business Aspects
-   **Merchandising Plans:** Kaze is considering selling physical merchandise related to "Return to Yoshi's Island," including:
    *   OST (Original Soundtrack) cartridges.
    *   Game boxes.
    *   Instruction booklets.
-   **Legal Considerations:**
    *   Aware that selling the game cartridge itself (as a ROM hack) would be a "huge legal issue" and is not planning to do so.
    *   Acknowledges the need to consult a lawyer regarding the legality of selling the OST if it contains samples from Mario 64, and also concerning the use of trademarked names/characters (like "Yoshi") on merchandise.
-   **Funding:** No mention of specific funding sources for the project.

## Key Quotes
-   "Basically, mission one, Mario runs around and causes a ruckus. Mission two, you knock off Bowser's statue's head. And mission three, everyone is striking and Bowser sends his strike breaker to stop the strike." (Outlines a clear narrative and gameplay progression for a level.)
-   "I was thinking we should develop like an Ocarina of Time hack. But instead of developing it like normally, we'll do it like a professional game studio... I think it'd be very fun." (Reveals Kaze's forward-thinking ideas and interest in exploring different development methodologies.)
-   "I might sell, like, OST cartridges with just the songs of RTYI. And I'm definitely gonna sell, like, boxes and instruction booklets and all that... Yeah, I would definitely ask a lawyer beforehand [regarding trademarks/samples]." (Shows intent for merchandise while being mindful of legal aspects.)
-   "The Goomba dialogue box was squished too... Hey, we get the flat text, all right, it works." (Highlights a small, humorous design detail and the satisfaction of implementing it.)
