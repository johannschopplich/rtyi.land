## Game Development Process
- Kaze is currently working on the first overworld of "Return to Yoshi's Island," specifically the second part, out of a planned 15 parts for the entire overworld.
- A major focus is on extensive custom engine development. Kaze states, "almost all of this engine here is my engine at this point," with only Mario's core physics and some actions remaining from vanilla SM64. This includes custom rendering, animations (quaternions), camera, collision, and even reworking the N64 operating system (Libultra).
- The development strategy is iterative and non-linear; areas are not fully completed before moving on, to allow for adjustments as other parts of the game take shape ("because when we work on the other areas we will likely have to adjust this one again").
- Specific current tasks include designing coin collection for the overworld, implementing environmental features like a volcano, and developing complex mechanics like the dynamic fog for the ghost ship area.
- Skyboxes are custom-made 3D models, not using the standard Mario 64 system.
- Work involves significant problem-solving for N64-era technical limitations, such as creating convincing volumetric-looking fog.

## Personal Insights
- Kaze Emanuar is driven by passion for "Return to Yoshi's Island," stating, "this one here is not any paid work at all this is just me working because of passion." This is contrasted with other commissioned projects he undertakes.
- He has strong opinions on game design, believing that "sometimes the part that people least like about the game are also the parts that are most necessary to make the game's design work."
- Kaze expresses frustration with inefficiencies in existing software and code, such as "lip ultra is dog shit unoptimized piece of shit code" and issues with NVIDIA Broadcast.
- He reflects on personal challenges like aging and maintaining cognitive sharpness ("Sometimes I feel like I'm getting older and my brain doesn't work like it used to anymore").
- Kaze is open about the development process, including moments of feeling "burned out," and is willing to admit when initial ideas aren't perfect ("I think their design is a little not great...they're still not perfect").
- He believes that "only really bad programmers care about which programming language they use for most applications" unless performance is critical.

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: No direct mention of Badub's work or contributions in this specific transcript.
- Biobak:
    - Biobak is responsible for significant graphical reworks of the overworld and levels. Kaze mentions, "I'd like to see the Biobak rework of the overworld" and "Biobak is going to rework all levels here."
    - Biobak's work is considered a distinct phase; some features are planned "after Biobak's final rework."
    - The level "ZooZooZoo" has already received a rework from Biobak, making it look better.
- Zeina: No direct mention of Zeina's animation work in this transcript, though Kaze mentions the animation system itself is custom (using quaternions).
- Other Contributors:
    - **Rovard and Voicel:** Mentioned as beta testers for Kaze's other project, "Drug Boss Mario."
    - **Mushi:** A fellow modder in the community, not directly involved with RTYI in this transcript.
    - **Chat Participants (e.g., Dainy Delphox/Leena):** Actively engage with Kaze during the stream, offering suggestions and feedback on design problems (like the fog effect), which Kaze considers and sometimes incorporates.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Overworld Design & Navigation:**
    - A key goal is to make the overworld (specifically "part 1") more engaging with collectible coins that are "easy to collect" without "making it suck."
    - Designing intuitive ways for players to navigate complex terrain, considering players who might not know advanced techniques like wallkicks ("I fear that some people that are here will not even understand what a wallkick is").
    - Creating varied and natural-looking barriers instead of just cliffs, e.g., "giant fruit," "tree line," "bananas."
    - Managing the scale and connectivity of 15 overworld parts, ensuring they feel cohesive. Kaze mentions being "a little worried that you can't really see the yoshi shape of the old in the end."
- **Ghost Ship Fog Mechanic:**
    - A major challenge discussed is implementing a dynamic fog effect for the ghost ship area (Course 4 entrance). The fog needs to obscure the ship initially, clear up after the player activates a lighthouse, and be technically feasible.
    - The solution involves fog intensity changing based on camera angle relative to the ship and player proximity. Getting too close before unlocking results in a fade-to-white and respawn. "How it's going to work is, here's the full idea. You enter this area, and when you look at the ship, there's going to be very strong fog..."
- **"Course for submissions" (User-made courses):** These required at least one rework to improve their quality ("their design is a little not great...we have already reworked all of them once to make them less bad").
- **Engine and Technical Features:**
    - Implementing custom rendering for coins (not 2D sprites or simple 3D models), Mario, and skyboxes (custom 3D models).
    - Reworking Mario's walking and swimming mechanics for better control and interaction with terrain.
- **Tutorialization:** Kaze reflects on how Mario 64 teaches movement and is mindful of teaching players in RTYI.

## Business Aspects
- "Return to Yoshi's Island" is explicitly stated to be a passion project, not a commissioned work: "this one here is not any paid work at all this is just me working because of passion."
- Kaze mentions the technical changes needed if he "wanted this to be like legally sellable," including replacing Mario's assets and the sound engine, and further customizing the OS. This indicates an awareness of commercialization requirements, though not an explicit plan for RTYI.
- He notes that his other project, "Drug Boss Mario," *is* a commissioned game, highlighting that he does undertake paid ROM hacking work.
- For "Drug Boss Mario," he discusses a phased beta testing approach, initially limiting access to long-time community members to "minimize the chance of leaks."

## Key Quotes
- "Well, what you probably don't realize is that like almost all of this engine here is my engine at this point. The only really thing that's still left from the vanilla 64 is Mario's physics." (Highlights the technical ambition and scope of custom work)
- "Sometimes the part that people least like about the game are also the parts that are most necessary to make the game's design work." (Kaze's game design philosophy)
- "This one here [Return to Yoshi's Island] is not any paid work at all this is just me working because of passion." (Clarifies the motivation behind the project)
- "Why don't we finish one area before moving on to the next um because when we work on the other areas we will likely have to adjust this one again so if we do that we waste a shit ton of that's why we don't do that." (Explains his iterative development methodology)

## Potential Interview Topics
- The motivation and process behind developing such a heavily customized engine for a ROM hack, and how it enables his vision for "Return to Yoshi's Island."
- The collaborative workflow with Biobak: how are tasks divided, how is creative vision shared and aligned for level aesthetics and rework?
- Kaze's perspective on the balance between honoring the original Mario 64 feel and introducing new mechanics/themes from Yoshi's Island.
- Discussion on specific design challenges, like the ghost ship fog, and the iterative process of arriving at a solution, including community input.
- The long-term vision for "Return to Yoshi's Island": what does "completion" look like, and are there any aspirations beyond a fan project, given his thoughts on making it "legally sellable"?
