## Game Development Process
-   The game "Return to Yoshi's Island" (RTYI) is actively in development.
-   Current map completion is stated as "9%."
-   Significant content, including the "final Bowser" and "five side levels," is still missing.
-   Kaze is continuously upgrading the game engine alongside content creation (e.g., new sound effect features, shader improvements for water foam).
-   Work is being done on visual elements like water foam, shaders for environmental objects (palm trees), and model UV mapping (cannon).
-   Development involves iterative tweaking and problem-solving, especially for visual effects and engine features.
-   There's a focus on debugging and ensuring compatibility, though frustrations with certain emulators (like Parallel) exist.
-   Kaze mentions having stats tracking for playtime, jumps, deaths, damage taken, coins, and save states.

## Personal Insights
-   Kaze values his creative output highly, stating, "I mean, I myself as a human don't have much value, right? The values in what I make."
-   He is driven by personal interest and enjoyment in his projects: "I wouldn't want to work on a game that brings me no joy." This influences his project choices, such as his disinterest in making a Super Mario World hack due to his dislike for the game.
-   He expresses strong opinions on technical subjects, such as AI in game development ("I don't think AI really has much of a use case for me right now") and emulator quality.
-   Kaze shows a degree of transparency in his development process, discussing technical challenges and his thought process openly on stream.
-   He has a somewhat dark or conspiratorial sense of humor, referencing the CIA and his "message of pure schizophrenia."
-   He reflects on a near-death experience, which briefly touches on his thoughts about life's inherent value.

## Collaborator Information
-   Badub: No relevant information found in this transcript.
-   Biobak (Graphics Artist):
    -   Biobak is responsible for graphics and will likely rework Kaze's placeholder assets: "Well, Biobak is probably going to change it anyway, so don't worry if you don't like it right now."
    -   Kaze aims to make placeholder assets "semi-decent looking, so Biobak doesn't puke when he sees this."
    -   Biobak provides feedback or has preferences Kaze considers, e.g., "Yep, this is exactly what Biobak wanted" (referring to wave height reduction near shore).
-   Zeina (Animator/Visual Reference):
    -   Mentioned as sending Kaze pictures of a nice region, possibly for visual inspiration: "Zayna is sending me pictures. Yes. Look what a nice region we were in." (Animations not specifically mentioned in this transcript).
-   Other Contributors:
    -   **Lila:** Appears to be a highly knowledgeable individual in the chat who provides significant technical support, advice, and debugging help to Kaze throughout the stream (e.g., on shaders, Blender issues, engine features like material labels, and emulator bugs). Kaze frequently consults Lila: "Lila, isn't this supposed to work?"
    -   **Fazerna:** Has access to the "Return to Yoshi's Island" repository: "Oh yeah, Fazerna could do it too. There's like 10 people that have access to Return to Yoshi's Island."
    -   **Falco:** Collaborated with Kaze to fix a bug related to the Parallel emulator for a previous RTYI demo release: "I worked with Falco to fix the bug that caused Parallel to crash on my ROM hack."
    -   **Miamek:** Gave Kaze advice regarding reworks, influencing Kaze's decision to proceed with certain changes: "That's true, Miamek, because you told me that it's fine to do that, and because you told me you had good ideas for it."

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
-   **Sound System Enhancement:** Kaze is working on a major feature to allow "two sound effects per bank can play at the same time," aiming to "seriously improve the sound effect quality." This has been "quite nasty to say the least."
-   **Water Foam Implementation:** A significant portion of the stream is dedicated to designing and implementing water foam effects. This involves decisions on UV mapping, vertex alpha, texture scrolling, matching foam to wave vertices, and making waves flatter near the shore. Challenges include pre-calculating wave height with limited vertex data storage.
-   **"Booloth" Sound Mystery:** Kaze explains his theory that the low-pitched "booloth" sound in BigBoo's Haunt (Mario 64) is part of the wind sound effect, revealed when the sound effect is cancelled or plays in full under specific conditions (like going through a door).
-   **Emulator Compatibility:** Kaze expresses significant frustration with the Parallel emulator, citing bugs that affected past RTYI releases and general usability issues. He prefers PJ64 1.6 for his own testing despite known vulnerabilities.
-   **Tooling and Engine Features:**
    -   Blender issues: Encountered a problem with a "UDIM" error preventing texture loading, and difficulties with UV mapping.
    -   Material Labels: Kaze discusses the need for material labels in the engine/tooling for shader work, expressing frustration with alternative "dogshit segment idea[s]."
-   **Graphics and Shaders:** Kaze works on improving shaders for objects like palm trees to achieve a "sun-kissed" look and better contrast.
-   **Memory Management:** Discusses a bug with the Parallel emulator where "you couldn't use the last byte in memory because of an off by one error," which affected his decompression routine.

## Business Aspects
-   **Release Date:** No projected release date is given; Kaze tells viewers, "You're gonna have to wait." and "Shouldn't be this hard to wait."
-   **Project Contingency:** Kaze has measures in place in case something happens to him: "There's like 10 people that have access to Return to Yoshi's Island. I also have a private repo with all the assets, so nothing would be lost if I died."
-   **Potential for Full-Time Development:** Kaze states he would "for sure, yes" work on game development full-time if he had enough patrons to support him.
-   **Monetization/Distribution:** No specific plans for selling the game are mentioned, but a hypothetical "What if I finished the game and then asked people to donate $50,000 before I release it?" is posed humorously. The project is a ROM hack, which typically has limitations on commercial distribution.
-   **Community Engagement:** The stream itself and Kaze's interactions with chat serve as a form of community engagement and progress update.

## Key Quotes
-   "Basically what I'm trying to do is make it so that two sound effects per bank can play at the same time. This would seriously improve the sound effect quality across the board." (Highlights a significant technical goal for RTYI)
-   "Well, Biobak is probably going to change it anyway, so don't worry if you don't like it right now. I'm not trying to put too much work into this, just like get this semi-decent looking, so Biobak doesn't puke when he sees this." (Illustrates the collaborative workflow and Kaze's iterative approach to graphics)
-   "There's like 10 people that have access to Return to Yoshi's Island. I also have a private repo with all the assets, so nothing would be lost if I died. But it's not like I am dying, so please, calm down." (Shows foresight for project preservation and a glimpse into his personal life concerns)
-   "The problem with me making a Mario World tag is that I don't like Mario World... And I wouldn't want to work on a game that brings me no joy." (Reveals Kaze's personal motivation and criteria for project selection)
