## Game Development Process
- The game "Return to Yoshi's Island" is actively in development, with Kaze working on level design, asset creation, mission structuring, and cutscenes live on stream.
- The project involves creating 15 courses, envisioned to be larger than the original Mario 64 courses.
- Kaze demonstrates an iterative workflow, switching between tasks such as roughing out level geometry (Wild West level), designing mission names and objectives (Oily Boily Bay), and creating/refining assets (pipes, cutscenes).
- Specific levels mentioned being worked on: a "Wild West" themed level (with a town and a surreal canyon sub-area) and "Oily Boily Bay" (an industrial, oil-rig-themed level).
- Milestones include roughing out level layouts, conceptualizing mission structures (e.g., a scavenger hunt), creating placeholder names for stars, and developing intro cutscenes synced to music.
- Technical aspects like collision maps, N64 performance optimization (e.g., model polycount), and ensuring the game fits on a standard 64MB N64 cartridge are considerations.
- Use of Fast64 plugin for Blender to N64 model conversion is mentioned.

## Personal Insights
- Kaze believes that "inoffensive easy platformers with no frustration" can be highly successful, citing games like Spongebob Battle for Bikini Bottom and Mario Odyssey as examples of this philosophy.
- He emphasizes the importance of music in game design, particularly for timing cutscenes and setting the mood of levels.
- Kaze expresses a desire to create games he enjoys and is passionate about, rather than working on projects he doesn't care for.
- He reflects on the challenges and learning process, such as noting "It didn't take 10 years to make a demo. It took 12. It's way better," indicating a long-term commitment and growth.
- He shows a pragmatic side, aiming for player enjoyment and clarity in game design, such as making star names act as hints.

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub (Bad00p):**
    - The primary music composer for Kaze's levels. Kaze states, "He always makes the music for my levels. Nowadays at least."
    - Music by Badub is used to time cutscenes and inspire level design.
- **Biobak (Biomic/Biobak):**
    - A graphics artist responsible for finishing and polishing certain areas.
    - Mentioned tasks: "Biobak said he would finish this area [power generator in Oily Boily Bay]" and an unfinished area in the 8-bit pipe section of Oily Boily Bay.
    - Kaze mentions challenges in paying Biobak due to issues with PayPal, requiring him to use cryptocurrency.
- **Zeina (Zeyna/Zainer):**
    - Works on animations and 3D models.
    - Specifically mentioned to be "working on right now" on a "skull" model for the Wild West level.
    - Kaze also compliments a skeleton model shown by "Zainer" during the stream.
- **Other Contributors:**
    - **PyroJ:** Mentioned in the context of pipe models. Kaze references a conversation with him and considers using his pipe texture, suggesting PyroJ is also involved in ROM hacking or asset creation and may have contributed or shared assets.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Level Design Philosophy:** Aiming for enjoyable, accessible platforming, potentially inspired by "Mario Odyssey" in terms of player freedom and non-punishing design (e.g., stars don't boot you out).
- **Mission Structure:** Star names are designed to be hints for players (e.g., "The crane and the cannon" for a star in Oily Boily Bay). A scavenger hunt mechanic is planned for the Wild West level's canyon area.
- **Asset Creation & Aesthetics:** Significant time is spent on creating and refining assets like warp pipes to look good within N64 limitations, including texture work, shading, and color variations. Kaze discusses the importance of visual clarity, such as making differently colored pipes distinguishable, even considering colorblindness.
- **Technical Challenges:**
    - Working within N64 hardware constraints (e.g., 64MB cartridge limit, optimizing models).
    - Debugging crashes and unexpected behavior (e.g., when implementing colored pipes).
    - Syncing cutscene camera movements precisely to music beats.
- **Specific Level Features:**
    - **Oily Boily Bay:** Includes elements like a large Bowser statue to be "beheaded," a cannon, a crane, a power generator area, red coin scaffolds, and an 8-bit pipe leading to a Smash 64-style level.
    - **Wild West Level:** Features a town area (milk bar, Koopa bank, sheriff's office) and a surreal canyon area with symbolic Wild West objects (giant shotgun, wheel, skull, hoof iron) used for platforming and a scavenger hunt. Colored pipes will serve as shortcuts.

## Business Aspects
- **Monetization/Distribution:** Kaze explicitly states the game will be open source and released for free: "Yes, the game will be open source... I unfortunately cannot monetize this I have to release it for free or I will get murdered."
- **Marketing/Visibility:** Kaze notes his streams are getting more viewers, attributing it partly to dual streaming on Twitch and YouTube, which increases project visibility and community engagement.

## Key Quotes
- "I have this theory... that if you make a game that is just not offensive to the player, just like an inoffensive easy platformer with no frustration, no friction, just like easily solvable everything, people will fucking love it." (Reveals Kaze's core design philosophy for this project).
- "The most important part of the cutscene for me is that it's fitting to the music. So, which beat do we cut it on? That's the question." (Highlights the strong integration of music into the design process).
- "This area is gonna have mostly just canyons but inside the canyons there's gonna be Wild West references Just things that are symbolic for it... Mario's goal in this area is gonna be to find the treasure." (Outlines a creative level concept and mission design).

## Potential Interview Topics
- **Kaze's Vision for "Return to Yoshi's Island":** Explore his overarching goals for the game, how it aims to differentiate itself from other Mario 64 ROM hacks, and the core experience he wants to deliver to players, stemming from his "inoffensive platformer" theory.
- **The Collaborative Workflow:** Delve into how Kaze manages and integrates contributions from Badub, Biobak, Zeina, and potentially others. How are creative visions aligned, and what are the challenges and rewards of this collaborative model for a passion project?
- **Balancing Ambition with N64 Limitations:** Discuss the specific technical and design challenges of creating a large-scale game on the Mario 64 decompilation, how decisions are made to work within N64 constraints (e.g., cartridge size, processing power), and any innovative solutions developed.
- **Designing "Oily Boily Bay" and the "Wild West" Level:** A deeper dive into the creative process, inspirations, and specific gameplay mechanics planned for these distinct levels, including the 8-bit pipe concept and the scavenger hunt.
- **The Role of Open Source and Community:** Discuss the decision to make the game open source and free, Kaze's relationship with the ROM hacking community, and how community feedback (e.g., via streams) influences development.
