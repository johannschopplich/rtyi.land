## Game Development Process
- Currently focused on designing and implementing a sub-area for a level (referred to as "Arts and Crafts stage" or "cardboard level"), which involves platforming over a void/lava on falling platforms.
- Key mechanics being implemented/refined in this area:
    - Two main platform designs that can be scaled and colored.
    - Saws between platforms that activate when the player gets close, forcing fast movement.
    - The platforms themselves fall after a certain trigger or proximity.
- Iterating on level layout, platform placement, scaling (using "B Berms"), and visual elements (textures, random colors for platforms).
- A "Chorus 1 demo" is still planned and will include a hidden N64 version of Delfino Plaza as an unlockable.
- Working on fixing bugs like "underflow" and "overflow" errors, and addressing asset scaling issues between Blender and the game engine.
- Considering environmental aesthetics, such as a "black and white" or "painted" look for certain areas, while being mindful of issues like texture repetition.
- Experimenting with new movement mechanics, such as a "long jump to force a front flip."

## Personal Insights
- Kaze's primary passion is game development itself; creating YouTube videos is seen as a way to make money to support this passion, rather than a passion in itself.
- He has strong opinions on game design, preferring fewer explicit options for players and valuing speedruns that remain recognizable to casual gameplay.
- He is candid about the frustrations and tedious aspects of development (e.g., "Doing this right now kind of sucks and I don't like it," referring to a specific task).
- He enjoys discussing the technical aspects of his work, like optimizations he has found.
- He is critical of design choices in other popular games (e.g., his critique of *Tears of the Kingdom*'s puzzle design and overpowered solutions).
- He expresses confidence in his own Mario 64 gameplay skills.

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: No specific mention of current contributions in this transcript.
- Biobak: No specific mention of current contributions in this transcript.
- Zeina: Mentioned in a personal context ("Zeina takes so long out of bed"), implying a close daily life connection. The prompt implies she works on animations, but this transcript doesn't detail her current game contributions.
- Other Contributors:
    - **Sauron:** Mentioned as a potential source of technical errors Kaze encounters ("If it's Sauron's fault then I won't even mention them..."). This suggests Sauron is involved in a technical capacity, perhaps developing tools or engine components Kaze uses.
    - **Lila (also referred to as Lina):** A prominent viewer in the chat who Kaze interacts with frequently, often in a teasing manner regarding bug reports or comments. Seems to be an active community member providing feedback.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Decisions:**
    - Implementing a specific level concept: a race-like experience across falling cardboard platforms with saws, over lava or an abyss.
    - Using two primary platform types with variable scaling and color for visual variety and design flexibility.
    - Introducing a new jump mechanic (long jump into a front flip).
    - Making the environment for the current sub-area "arbitrary," possibly with a black and white or painted aesthetic.
    - Hiding a significant piece of content (Delfino Plaza N64) in the upcoming demo.
- **Challenges:**
    - **Technical Bugs:** Encountering and fixing "underflow" and "overflow" errors.
    - **Asset Pipeline:** Significant discrepancies in how objects (especially scaled ones) appear in Blender versus the Mario 64 engine ("Dude how is this so fucked there's clearly a large difference...").
    - **Visuals:** Finding a good solution for floor textures to avoid excessive repetition, especially with a "painted" style.
    - **Mechanics Implementation:** Ensuring complex interactions work as intended (e.g., bombs correctly navigating turns on a conveyor).
    - **Emulator Issues:** Dealing with quirks and bugs in emulators used for development and testing (e.g., Parallel Launcher not rendering coins correctly for him).
    - **Difficulty Balancing:** Adjusting platform spacing and timing to be challenging but not unfairly punishing.

## Business Aspects
- **Monetization/Funding:** Kaze explicitly states that making YouTube videos is "a way to make money" to support his primary goal of making the game.
- **Marketing/Promotion:** He uses YouTube streaming and video uploads to engage with an audience and test content ideas (e.g., the BLJ video was an experiment). He monitors video performance (views).
- **Release/Distribution:** A "Chorus 1 demo" is a planned release. He also speculates on potential speedrun times for the final game, indicating thought towards its post-release life.

## Key Quotes
- "My passion is not making YouTube videos it is making the video [game]... Making YouTube videos, for me, that's just a way to make money." (Clarifies his motivations and priorities).
- "So the idea is I have these two platform designs and I can place these platforms as I want around the level. And there's going to be saws between the platforms. And when you get close enough to a saw, the saw starts going. So you do have to constantly move pretty fast to not die in this level." (Explains a core design philosophy for a current level).
- "Dude how is this so fucked there's clearly a large difference Between how all of this is applied in blender versus in Mario 64 That is so weird." (Highlights a significant technical challenge in the development pipeline).

## Potential Interview Topics
- **The Philosophy Behind "Return to Yoshi's Island's" Difficulty:** Explore Kaze's approach to challenge in game design, particularly in the context of ROM hacking and his desire to push Mario 64 mechanics.
- **Creative Process in Level Design:** Ask about his methods for designing levels like the "Arts and Crafts" stage – how much is planned vs. discovered through iteration, and how he balances technical constraints with creative vision.
- **The Role of the "Decompilation Project" in His Work:** Discuss how the Mario 64 decompilation project has enabled or influenced his ability to create "Return to Yoshi's Island" and implement novel mechanics.
- **Managing Community and Development:** Inquire about how he balances active community engagement during live development streams with focused, solitary development work, and how community feedback impacts the game.
- **Future Vision for Kaze Emanuar as a Creator:** Beyond "Return to Yoshi's Island," what are his broader ambitions as a game developer, and how does he see his unique N64 development skills evolving?
