## Game Development Process
- The project is in a refinement and bug-fixing stage. Kaze is working on older levels that were broken by previous "engine updates."
- A major current task is implementing shaders and environmental effects, specifically fog, across the overworld to establish a specific mood.
- The goal for the stream was to "make some progress in the overworld" and "finish the first round of adding shaders."
- Kaze is actively working on new gameplay elements, such as creating bouncy "grape" platforms from scratch, including their models, colors, physics, and sound effects.
- There is a focus on preparing the repository for easier exporting and ensuring the game will run well on original N64 hardware.

## Personal Insights
- Kaze finds satisfaction in the less glamorous parts of development, stating, "it's actually really fun to work on bug fixes."
- He has a strong artistic vision for the game's atmosphere, at one point musing about making the overworld feel "dead," potentially by removing textures and automating Mario's movement to create a specific experience.
- He expresses a high standard for quality, critiquing other major game franchises (like Pokémon and Sonic) for lacking quality or innovation, which reflects his own development philosophy.
- He shows a desire to make the development process more efficient, mentioning, "I love this new system with the bitflex this is so convenient."

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: No relevant information found.
- Biobak: No relevant information found.
- Zeina: Kaze mentions watching the show "BNA" with someone named "Zayna," but no contributions to the game project itself are specified in this transcript.
- Other Contributors:
  - **sarin:** Credited with creating something "so cool" for the "retro section" of the final level.
  - **Mrs. Case (Kaze's partner):** Is actively working on game assets. She is "currently still working on the Penguin Town for course 13."
  - **Lila:** A knowledgeable member of the community active in the stream chat. Kaze engages with her on technical topics (like fog implementation) and jokes with her, suggesting a role as a trusted tester or sounding board.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Atmospheric Fog System:** A key challenge is implementing a dynamic fog system. The goal is to have the world fade to white as the player approaches a specific ship, but only after a certain "lighthouse" objective is completed. The technical challenge lies in making the fog appear correctly from all distances and under different conditions without graphical glitches. Kaze iterates on this by adjusting fog start distances and programming a custom "fog controller."
- **Fixing Legacy Issues:** A recurring problem is that engine updates have broken older assets. Kaze mentions issues with "decals" and an "ugly fence" that needs replacement because a once-static camera is now dynamic.
- **Overworld Mood:** Kaze is making deliberate choices to create a unique, somber atmosphere. He says, "I was thinking the entire world should just be dead," which is a guiding principle for the overworld's visual design.
- **New Gameplay Mechanics:** Kaze designs and implements a new "grape" platforming object. He makes decisions on its shape, its bouncy properties, its visual look (using prim colors and textures), and its sound design ("squishy sound").

## Business Aspects
- **Community Engagement/Marketing:** Kaze maintains a regular YouTube upload schedule to keep his audience engaged, mentioning plans for videos "on this saturday and then another another video on um shit when is it the 14th of next month."
- **Platform/Distribution:** He confirms the game is being developed with original hardware in mind, stating, "this is gonna run well on N64. So on N64, you're guaranteed to have a good experience." This is a key feature for his target audience.

## Key Quotes
- "These old levels are going to become a lot more playable soon because we broke them over time with engine updates so making them playable again is very cool." (This quote encapsulates the current development phase of refining and fixing the existing game.)
- "I was thinking the entire world should just be dead. I'm thinking of also removing the textures and then also I think Mario should move automatically so you don't even have to play the game here." (This highlights Kaze's strong, unconventional artistic vision for the game's atmosphere.)
- "I will now refuse to play a Pokémon game until we get that quality again... I am doing this to improve society for all of us. This is how gamers think." (A humorous but telling quote revealing his high standards and passion for quality in game design, which he applies to his own project.)

## Potential Interview Topics
- **The "Dead World" Philosophy:** Explore the artistic intent behind the overworld's design. What emotions or experiences is he trying to evoke by making it "dead" and foggy? How does this tie into the game's narrative or themes?
- **Balancing Innovation and Legacy:** The game is built on the SM64 decompilation but is also a new creation. How does he balance the process of creating new engine features versus fixing old levels and assets that those new features break?
- **The Role of Collaboration and Community:** Discuss how contributions from collaborators like "sarin" and "Mrs. Case," and real-time feedback from knowledgeable community members like "Lila," shape the final product.
- **Designing for N64 Hardware in the Modern Era:** What are the unique challenges and creative opportunities that come from specifically targeting original N64 hardware for a new, complex game in the 2020s?
- **Defining Quality in a ROM Hack:** Kaze has strong opinions on what makes a game "good." Ask him how he defines quality for "Return to Yoshi's Island" and what specific elements (gameplay, atmosphere, technical performance) he is prioritizing to meet his own high standards.
