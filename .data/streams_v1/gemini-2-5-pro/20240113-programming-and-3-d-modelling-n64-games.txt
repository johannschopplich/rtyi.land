## Game Development Process
-   Active development on multiple significant levels, including a new Western-themed saloon area and a substantial rework of the pirate ship level (Course 5/"Chris5").
-   The development follows an iterative cycle: assets and level designs (often from collaborators like Biomech) are reviewed, tested, and technically adapted by Kaze for N64 compatibility.
-   A strong emphasis is placed on optimizing for N64 hardware, involving constant adjustments to texture formats, polygon counts, rendering techniques, and overall performance.
-   Kaze is developing a custom, optimized engine for the game, which he plans to release publicly alongside the hack.
-   Debugging and troubleshooting, particularly when integrating new or revised assets, form a significant part of the daily development work. For example, Kaze spends a considerable amount of time diagnosing and fixing a crash after importing Biomech's updated pirate ship model.
-   Levels are being revisited and overhauled; the pirate ship, originally made "three years ago," is undergoing a complete visual and structural rework.

## Personal Insights
-   Kaze highly values creating a specific "vibe" and atmosphere in levels, often discussing lighting, textures, and music to achieve the desired mood (e.g., a "dark" saloon, a "ghost ship").
-   He expresses clear opinions on game design principles, such as the appropriate density of NPCs, the importance of intuitive puzzle design ("This is good because we are showing a cool idea to the player... Difficulty here is unnecessary"), and maintaining visual consistency.
-   Frustration is evident with N64 technical limitations and the repetitive nature of some tasks (e.g., fixing texture formats, dealing with captchas), but he also shows dedication to overcoming these hurdles.
-   He appears to enjoy the creative problem-solving aspects of development, particularly in making ambitious visual ideas work on the N64.
-   Kaze maintains an open development process by live-streaming his work and interacting with his audience, incorporating their feedback or reactions into his commentary.

## Collaborator Information
-   **Biomech (referred to as "Biobak" or "Biomech"):** The primary 3D artist and level designer for significant parts of the game. Biomech is responsible for the extensive rework of the pirate ship level (Course 5), providing new models, textures, lighting, and level layouts. Kaze meticulously reviews Biomech's detailed changelogs and assets, making necessary technical adjustments (e.g., texture formats, polygon optimization, layer assignments) to ensure N64 compatibility and performance. The stream heavily features Kaze going through Biomech's Blender file and list of changes.
-   **Badoob (Badoob):** The composer for the game. Kaze mentions waiting for a saloon theme from Badoob and later reviews a submitted track, providing feedback that it's "too much like the zoo song" and not quite the vibe he's looking for, but notes Badoob is already working on changes.
-   **Zeina (Zayn):** Mentioned briefly in the context of animations ("zayn i just scrubbed last week the hell how are you doing this"), suggesting ongoing work on animations for the game.
-   **Other Contributors:**
    *   "Someone on Twitter": Sent Kaze a cactus model used in the Western-themed level.
    *   Kaze also mentions sharing his custom engine with "some of the other hackers" in the community.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
-   **NPC Density and Dialogue:** A recurring challenge is balancing the desire for lively, populated environments with the practical difficulty of writing meaningful dialogue for numerous NPCs and potential performance impacts on the N64. Kaze states, "it's very difficult to come up with good text for like a million npcs."
-   **Lighting and Atmosphere:** Significant effort is invested in creating specific moods using lighting (e.g., dark saloons, shiny lamps on the pirate ship, glowing goo). This often requires custom solutions and careful management of N64 rendering capabilities, such as avoiding expensive clear colors.
-   **N64 Technical Limitations:** A core challenge is making modern game design ambitions fit N64 constraints. This includes:
    *   Texture management (formats like CI4, RGBA16, IA8, resolution limits, and memory).
    *   Polygon budgets ("A thousand seven hundred triangles only. That's good.").
    *   Rendering performance (dealing with overdraw, Z-sorting issues for transparent or layered objects, and the performance cost of certain effects).
    *   Kaze frequently has to modify collaborator Biomech's detailed models and textures to work efficiently.
-   **Level Reworks and Iteration:** Older levels are being significantly overhauled. The pirate ship (Course 5) is a prime example, with Biomech providing a near-total redesign that Kaze then integrates and refines.
-   **Gameplay Mechanics & Puzzles:** New interactive elements are discussed, such as a jail cell that visually fills up as players capture outlaws, a bouncy plank on the pirate ship potentially leading to a collectible, and environmental puzzles like a pushable shelf revealing a secret. Kaze emphasizes making puzzles intuitive rather than overly difficult.
-   **Visual Cohesion:** Kaze is attentive to maintaining a consistent art style, critiquing textures or models that "look very out of style" or don't fit the established aesthetic.

## Business Aspects
-   **Open Source Release:** Kaze explicitly states his intention to release the game and its custom engine as open source: "yeah yeah when i release this hack my engine will be public i'll make the hack open source like all of it at the same time."
-   **Community Engagement:** While not direct funding, Kaze engages with his audience through streaming (Twitch and YouTube simultaneously), sharing progress, and has a "Kaze Clips YouTube channel." This serves as a form of community building and informal marketing.
-   No relevant information found regarding traditional funding, sales plans, or formal marketing campaigns (as expected for a ROM hack).

## Key Quotes
-   "this game on purpose doesn't have a clear color because applying the clear color takes around three milliseconds which is like 10 percent of the render time of a frame so doing a clear color is gonna be very very expensive for you at 64." (Highlights the deep technical considerations and N64-specific optimizations).
-   "Biobak has been hyping this one up for a while... Oh god, this is so different. Holy shit, everything is different. How did he do it?... first of all, dude, this is fucking sick looking. Look at this. Oh my god." (Showcases Kaze's reaction to Biomech's significant contributions and the iterative nature of their collaboration on level design).
-   "yeah yeah when i release this hack my engine will be public i'll make the hack open source like all of it at the same time." (Clearly states the plan for the project's release and its contribution back to the modding community).

## Potential Interview Topics
1.  **The Kaze-Biomech Collaboration:** Delve deeper into the dynamic of their collaboration. How do they align on vision? What is the typical workflow for a level rework like the pirate ship, from concept to N64 integration? What are the unique challenges and benefits of this remote artistic-technical partnership?
2.  **Pushing N64 Boundaries:** Explore Kaze's philosophy and motivation for developing such a technically advanced ROM hack on aging hardware. What specific N64 limitations does he find most challenging or interesting to overcome?
3.  **Open Source Philosophy:** Discuss the decision to make "Return to Yoshi's Island" and its engine open source. What impact does he hope this will have on the SM64 modding community? What are the pros and cons he foresees?
4.  **Evolution of "Return to Yoshi's Island":** How has the overall vision for the game changed from its inception to its current state, especially with major reworks of older content and the development of a custom engine?
5.  **Creative Problem Solving with Technical Constraints:** Ask for more examples of how N64 limitations have directly influenced or forced creative solutions in level design, gameplay mechanics, or visual presentation beyond what was discussed for the pirate ship.
