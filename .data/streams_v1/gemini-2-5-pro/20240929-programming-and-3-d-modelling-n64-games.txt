## Game Development Process
- The game, "Return to Yoshi's Island," is in a late stage of development, with Kaze working on the 14th of 15 planned main courses (out of approximately 30 total levels).
- Recent focus includes developing new enemy types (Thimble Guys, Bert the Bashful) for these later courses, including their AI, animations, and unique mechanics.
- A significant graphical rework of Course 1 (an earlier level) by collaborator Biomech is being reviewed and integrated.
- An upcoming major milestone is the release of a game demo, for which Kaze is preparing promotional material (Patreon post).
- The game will feature approximately 135 main stars and 45 "Yoshi Stars," which are special missions with unique restrictions (e.g., A-press limits).
- Kaze is also planning future YouTube content, including a re-release of "The Missing Link" with updates.

## Personal Insights
- **Kaze's vision for the overworld:** He emphasizes the importance of the overworld encompassing the entirety of Yoshi's Island, offering a 360° view and encouraging exploration of every "nook or cranny."
    - *"I was thinking for the overworld. It is super important that the overworld is the entirety of Yoshi's Island. It is important that you get like a 360° round view of the beach next to Yoshi's Island. So it feels like you can actually explore the entire island."*
- **Critique of Badoob's music for a level:** While appreciative of the effort, Kaze feels a submitted track doesn't quite fit the "adventure" vibe of the level and lacks a hummable melody.
    - *"For me It doesn't fit the vibe. Feels more like A beach at sunset. Not like a complete adventure, you know. And I'm also kinda missing the The melody that you can hum along to."*
- **Pragmatism on naming:** Kaze admits he doesn't personally care much about names for things but acknowledges their importance for public communication and avoiding confusion.
    - *"Truth be told, i'm not someone who cares about names for things i know what it does and it's good enough for me but i will need a name to tell people on what it is..."*
- **On Large Language Models (LLMs):** Kaze expresses skepticism about the current utility of LLMs beyond being a "better Google."
    - *"I have talked to a company that makes a thing to gather data for AI... And since I talked to them, I have just gotten 100% sure that all large language models are just garbage."*

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub (Composer):**
    - Created a song for the current level Kaze is working on. Kaze solicits feedback from the stream chat and offers his own critique regarding its thematic fit.
    - *"This is the song that Badoob made for this level..."*
- **Biomech/Biobak (Graphics Artist):**
    - Responsible for a significant graphical rework of Course 1, including visual enhancements and optimizations (reducing tris and materials).
    - Kaze reviews Biomech's work in detail, discusses integrating it, and notes the need to sometimes fix texture formats from Biomech's files.
    - *"Let's check out Biobak's rework... Quick facts, 220 fewer tries, 7 fewer materials, that is insane."*
    - *"Oh yeah, Biomech, can you send me a cool screenshot of the level? I wanna make a Patreon post about the demo releasing soon."*
- **Xena (Mentioned as Zeina in prompt):**
    - The transcript only mentions Kaze playing Minecraft with "Xena." No direct contributions to "Return to Yoshi's Island" are detailed in this specific transcript.
    - *"I have started playing Minecraft for the first time recently with Xena."*
- **Other Contributors:**
    - **Retro:** Mentioned as a collaborator whose work or task completion is awaited before Kaze can import certain things related to Biomech's rework.
        - *"Thoughts on checking out the rework today and importing it later when retro is done."*

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Thimble Guy Mechanics & Aesthetics:**
    - **Challenge:** Designing their defeat. Squishing them would contradict their hard, thimble-like nature.
        - *"The thing is, if we make them squish, it wouldn't look like a thimble anymore. Because a thimble is hard material."*
    - **Solution:** Making them behave like "Bullies" from Mario 64, where Mario must knock them off platforms.
        - *"I was thinking they should work more like bully fights where you kick them off the thing."*
    - **Challenge:** Implementing a dynamic light reflection (shine) on their thimble hats, which involved significant debugging due to a compiler-related variable shadowing issue.
        - *"And I need to make it so that the light reflection on the hat properly moves when you turn the camera."* (Followed by extensive debugging)
- **Bert the Bashful (Painted Egg Enemy) Design:**
    - **Goal:** Create an enemy that looks "handcrafted" and like a "painted egg." Initial designs felt a bit "cheap."
        - *"I like him, but he doesn't look very handcrafted. Yeah, I like him to look like a painted egg. But the sharp cutout here is kind of ruining that."*
    - **Behavior:** Designed to jump aggressively and bounce Mario back upon contact, making them dangerous near pits or death floors, aligning with their behavior in Yoshi's Island.
        - *"And when he touches you, he doesn't deal damage. He bounces you back... And because there's so much depth floor here, that makes them really, really dangerous."*
- **Level Naming:**
    - **Challenge:** Finding a suitable name for the current crafty-themed level.
    - **Suggestions/Considerations:** "Handmade Heights" and "Paper Craft Peaks" were liked by Kaze. He considers alliteration and rhyme.
        - *"Handmade heights and paper craft peaks. Those were the two I liked."*
- **Overworld Concept:**
    - **Design Choice:** The overworld should be the entirety of Yoshi's Island, explorable in 360 degrees, with progression unlocking deeper areas of the island.

## Business Aspects
- **Marketing and Promotion:**
    - Kaze plans to create a Patreon post to announce the upcoming demo release.
        - *"I wanna make a Patreon post about the demo releasing soon."*
    - He considers making more "Mario 64 facts" videos for his YouTube channel to gain broader viewership.
        - *"I was thinking of making more like Mario 64 facts videos if the BLJ one does well... I think that's the kind of slop that YouTube viewers love and I think we can get famous that way."*
- **Release and Distribution:**
    - A demo of "Return to Yoshi's Island" is planned to be released soon.
    - Kaze entertains the idea of releasing the game's Original Soundtrack (OST) on a physical cartridge, potentially as merchandise.
        - *"I was actually thinking of just releasing R.T.Y.I. Together with an OST cartridge... Because then we could sell it too As merch."*
- **Legal Considerations:**
    - Kaze is aware of Nintendo's stance on fan projects (mentioning his "Missing Link" video being taken down) and plans to consult a lawyer before releasing "Return to Yoshi's Island."
        - *"But I will probably talk to a lawyer Before I release R.T.Y.I."*

## Key Quotes
- *"It's going to be like 30 levels in total, but 15 main courses and we're on the 14th."* (Provides a clear indication of project scope and progress).
- *"I was thinking for the overworld. It is super important that the overworld is the entirety of Yoshi's Island... So it feels like you can actually explore the entire island."* (Highlights a key design ambition for the game).
- *"And this is why you don't trust your fucking compiler. You look at the assembly and then you find it out. Fuck you, GCC."* (Illustrates a moment of intense debugging and a developer's frustration/triumph).
- *"But I will probably talk to a lawyer Before I release R.T.Y.I."* (Shows awareness of the potential legal landscape for fan projects).
