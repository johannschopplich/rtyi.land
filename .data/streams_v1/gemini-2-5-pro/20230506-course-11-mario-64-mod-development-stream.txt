## Game Development Process
- The stream focuses on the initial art style and visual theme definition for a new level, "Frantic Fleet Factory" (internally "Chris XI").
- Kaze starts with sketches and a basic layout idea, then iteratively experiments with textures, color schemes, and environmental elements (lava vs. oil).
- The process involves referencing other games (e.g., Mario Sunshine's Rico Harbor, Skyward Sword, Metal Harbor) for inspiration.
- Key development stages shown: conceptualization, visual prototyping in Blender, in-game testing, and refinement of effects and assets.
- There's a clear priority on establishing the level's aesthetic ("look and feel") before detailed construction begins.
- Kaze mentions the game will have 15 courses, and this level is Course 11.
- Discussion of a "zoo level" previously worked on, highlighting iterative learning about visual aspects like saturation.

## Personal Insights
- Kaze finds starting a level (defining its initial look and feel) to be the "most interesting but also the hardest part."
- He describes a common creative cycle: initial frustration where ideas seem like "dogshit," followed by a breakthrough moment where it feels like "the best thing ever."
- He expresses a strong opinion that finishing a major SM64 ROM hack requires immense dedication, jokingly stating one needs to be "mentally ill" to undertake such a project for free.
- Kaze values conciseness in communication.
- He openly admits to using "clickbait" titles for his YouTube videos for engagement.

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: Not directly named in this transcript as the composer for "Return to Yoshi's Island." However, Kaze discusses desired musical themes for the level ("evil, bowser, construction") and mentions standards for music contributions, implying collaboration with a composer.
- Biobak: Actively contributes to visual design. Kaze takes Biobak's suggestions seriously, such as trying "black water with orange highlights" for the oil, and credits him with helping with "level layouts" or "level visuals."
- Zeina: Mentioned personally (writing wedding thank you cards, made pizza). Her role as an animator for the project is not detailed in this specific transcript, though implied by her known involvement in Kaze's projects.
- Other Contributors:
    - **Chat:** The livestream chat provides real-time feedback and suggestions, some of which Kaze considers or implements (e.g., ideas for the oil effect, color schemes).
    - **"Many, many people"**: Credited generally for "text just..." which likely refers to existing ripped assets or community tools used.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Level Theme Evolution:** The level concept shifts significantly from a construction zone on a volcano with lava to an offshore oil rig with a sea of oil. This change was driven by a desire for more color and a less "boring" or "monocolored" aesthetic.
- **Visual Effects for Oil:** A significant portion of the stream is dedicated to creating a dynamic, rainbow-reflective oil slick effect, involving complex shader work and iteration to get the look right (e.g., "clown vomit water" at one point).
- **Color Palette:** Extensive discussion and experimentation with color schemes to make the level visually appealing and distinct, moving from desaturated volcano colors to considerations of purple-orange-blue, and finally settling on a purple/yellow theme for platforms over dark oil.
- **Technical Limitations (N64):** Constant awareness of N64 hardware constraints, particularly polygon counts ("We might have to rethink the way that the elements are in this level... without making it so many polygons that's gonna lag on the n64"), draw distance, and texture memory. This impacts level structure and asset design.
- **Platform Design:** 고민 on how to design the main platforms, referencing Rico Harbor and Metal Harbor, and focusing on creating modular, visually interesting platform assets in Blender.
- **Level Layout and Structure:** Initial idea of a Rico Harbor-like layout. Later, with the oil rig theme, discussion of distinct areas, a "power generator building," and potentially using pipes to transition between sections to manage complexity and performance. The idea of an "extremely vertical area" is mentioned.
- **Enemy Integration:** Consideration of adding "looking bullies" as enemies that would fit the construction/industrial theme.
- **Yoshi Coin Placement:** Brief discussion on the planned locations for Yoshi Coins within the level, tied to mission objectives and specific areas like "Bowser's office" and "sewers."
- **Narrative Context:** The level is where Bowser builds his airships, and the player arrives after destroying his fleet in a previous Bowser level, adding a story connection.

## Business Aspects
- **Monetization:** Kaze mentions a viewer's donation and his own failure to properly set up a donation system. He explicitly states he doesn't think he can sell the ROM hack ("I don't think I can [release it on a shop]").
- **Marketing/Promotion:** Kaze is creating YouTube content, such as a video titled "Mario64's movement is not perfect," which he calls "good clickbait." This serves as a form of community engagement and indirect promotion for his work.
- **No plans for commercial release:** The nature of it being a ROM hack using Nintendo's IP prevents commercialization.

## Key Quotes
- "So I always find this to be the most interesting but also the hardest part of making a level and that is getting the start." (Reflecting on the creative process)
- "See, that's always how it goes. You start making a level and you feel like, wow, this is dogshit, this is garbage, this is not working out at all. And then you get a few ideas and suddenly it's like, ah, shit, this is gonna be the best thing ever." (Describing the emotional arc of level design)
- "Today stream is dedicated to making sure that the level can look good. That's always our first priority before we start making the level. We decide something where platforming can be then we look how we can theme this in a way that looks good with nice colors." (Highlighting the design philosophy for level creation)
- "Basically, this is going to be where Bowser builds all his airships. And this is especially funny, because this is course 11. And in the second Bowser level, which is the level right before this, you destroy his entire fleet, right? So now you go back to where the ships were actually built." (Explaining the level's narrative context)
