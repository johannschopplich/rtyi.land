## Game Development Process
- All 15 core courses for "Return to Yoshi's Island" are complete.
- Current development is heavily focused on designing and structuring the overworld, particularly how players progress through and unlock later sections (Parts 10-15).
- Kaze is working on implementing specific unlock mechanisms and gating content to prevent players from being overwhelmed.
- The game is intended to be a seamless, interconnected open world with no loading zones between areas.
- A new pause menu with an animated "unrolling map" feature is planned.
- Beta testing for player behavior and design feedback is a recognized need.

## Personal Insights
- Kaze is highly focused on the player experience, aiming for "cool" moments and intuitive design.
- He has a strong design philosophy that favors player freedom, especially for main progression, preferring overworld events or broader achievements over specific, arbitrary tasks to unlock main paths.
- He values immersive design where barriers feel genuine rather than artificial game restrictions.
- Kaze expresses excitement for innovative features like the animated world map and unique NPC interactions.
- He uses self-deprecating humor (e.g., about his map's appearance) but shows clear passion for the project.

- Zeina: No specific contributions or interactions mentioned in this transcript.
- Other Contributors:
    - **Martisti:** Working on a "Greek garden level" which is planned for the third overworld area (near Course 10). Kaze mentions Martisti's level looks "super cool" and is considering how its geometry might inspire solutions for overworld connections.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Major Challenge:** Structuring player progression for Parts 10-15. The initial setup allows access to too many areas at once, which Kaze wants to restrict to avoid overwhelming the player.
- **Solution Brainstorming for Progression:**
    - Initial ideas included star barriers or requiring completion of specific levels.
    - Kaze leans towards "Overworld Events" triggered by broader player progress (e.g., X stars collected) to unlock new areas.
    - Specific event ideas:
        - **Bone Dragon:** An initially hostile dragon in the lava area that can be befriended by fixing a problem (e.g., a cavity), then helps the player access a new area and potentially offers a star for a "gold tooth" quest. This is designed to subvert boss battle expectations.
        - **Yap Blocks & Kamek:** Using "Yap Blocks" (talking blocks from Yoshi's Island) to bar access to Part 13. A Kamek boss fight event would occur later in the game (e.g., in Part 5's area), and defeating Kamek would turn the (previously insulting/evil) Yap Blocks friendly, causing them to move and open the paths.
- **Seamless World Design:** A core goal is to have a fully interconnected overworld without loading screens, making the entire island feel like one large, explorable space.
- **Secret Back Entrance:** An idea for a secret back entrance to Course 1, potentially leading into a windmill with a small reward, designed to be a cool, purposeless discovery.
- **Pause Menu:** Decided to implement an unrolling map animation for the pause menu.
- **Target Audience:** Casual players looking for adventure and freedom.

## Business Aspects
- **Beta Testing:** Kaze is actively seeking beta testers to provide feedback on player behavior and design, rather than just bug testing. He's considering a Discord server for this.
- **Commissioned Work:** Kaze mentions "Drag Wars," a game he was commissioned to make, indicating he does paid game development work.
- **Release Version:** Currently, only an NTSC version is being worked on, though a PAL version might be possible later.
- **"Slop Video" Content:** Kaze notes the high engagement on his "slop videos" and considers making more due to YouTube analytics, a form of content strategy.

## Key Quotes
- "Okay, today we have a bit of an issue we need to solve. And that is the issue that once you unlock part 10, you can go to part 11, part 12, part 13, 14, and 15. And this is a bit much. For that reason, I want to lock part 13 and 15 away."
- "Yes, you look at him [Bone Dragon], you expect a boss battle, but do we really need a full boss battle? Isn't it way funnier and way more impactful if you don't get the boss battle you expect?"
- "The whole world is going to feel so alive. There's going to be events. Everything's connected. There's no loading zones. You just go from thing to thing. It's just going to feel like a gigantic open world. It's going to be insane, man."
- "I want people to feel like any barrier that they encounter is a genuine barrier and not just the game telling them. No."

## Potential Interview Topics
- **The Design Philosophy of Player Progression:** Explore Kaze's approach to guiding players through a large, open world without resorting to linear or arbitrary unlock conditions for main path progression. How does he balance freedom with structure?
- **Crafting Memorable Overworld Events:** Delve into the creation process for unique encounters like the Bone Dragon and the Kamek/Yap Block storyline. What is his goal with these events, and how does he ensure they enhance the feeling of a "living world"?
- **Subverting Expectations in Game Design:** Discuss the decision to make the Bone Dragon a potential friend rather than a traditional boss. What is the appeal of this design choice, and are there other instances where he plans to play with player assumptions?
- **Achieving a Seamless Open World in Mario 64:** Investigate the technical and design challenges of creating an interconnected overworld without loading zones on the N64 platform. What innovations or tricks is he employing?
- **Integrating Collaborative Work:** How does Kaze incorporate contributions like Martisti's level into his overarching vision? What is the dynamic of working with other creators on a project primarily driven by his own direction?
