## Game Development Process
- **Overall Progress:** The stream shows Kaze actively working on a specific level, focusing on a new enemy ("coin-stealing guy") and implementing its mechanics related to Yoshi Coins. He mentions this is the "last Yoshi coin in this level."
- **Major Milestones:**
    - Nearing completion of a level: "after this by the way we're done with the level all that will be missing is some animations then Zayna's currently working on and the sign."
    - By the end of the stream, Kaze states: "All right, all that's missing on the level here now It's a few animations that I'm not making the science that's in us making and then the condition of that I have to make Like the wood needs to make what sounds and stuff like that and some things need to be climbable But I think other than that we're all done."
- **Development Stages:** The stream captures a mix of feature implementation (enemy AI, dialogue, interactions), bug fixing (coin rendering, cutscene logic, enemy pathing, particle despawning), and integration of collaborator assets (animations, music).
- **Future Work:** After the current tasks, "it is time to make the collision work." The next stream will likely not be on "Course 12" (current level name?) anymore, implying moving to new content or bug-fixing.

## Personal Insights
- **Design Philosophy:** Kaze aims to create engaging mechanics. For example, Yoshi Coins are designed to be "obtained by interacting with the environment in like creative ways," inspired by Mario Sunshine, and to "fuel that like sense of exploration."
- **Frustrations:** He expresses significant frustration with unhelpful external resources like Stack Overflow ("biggest mistake of my life," "they just want to waste my time") and technical annoyances like a persistent GCC compiler "note."
- **Problem-Solving Approach:** Kaze demonstrates a hands-on, iterative approach to debugging and feature development, often working through issues live on stream.
- **Opinions on Game Elements:** He has strong opinions on game design, such as disliking how 100-coin stars are often implemented and wanting to improve upon that with Yoshi Coins.
- **Future Aspirations:** While passionate about ROM hacking, he acknowledges its financial limitations: "most likely it will be my own game made in Unreal Engine just cuz I have to think about the financial aspects as well."

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub (also referred to as "Doop"):**
    - Role: Composer.
    - Contribution: "Doop is also currently making a song for the Western dual scene I believe so that's gonna be very fun." He is also likely responsible for other music, as Kaze mentions wanting to "show you the hideout music."
- **Biobak:**
    - Role: Graphics artist/Level work.
    - Contribution: "Biobak still has some work to do after." Kaze also mentions potential graphical issues Biobak might address or that Kaze will fix himself, e.g., "the vertex colors on this are really dirty and bad oh we gotta fix that." Kaze notes for Biobak: "Biobak if you look at this level you will see a few issues like this around don't worry about it I'll fix those at the end."
- **Zeina:**
    - Role: Animator.
    - Contribution: "all that will be missing is some animations then Zayna's currently working on." Animations are needed for the coin-stealing enemy's "trip" and other elements to finalize the level.
- **Other Contributors:**
    - **Saschka Pity (Chat Member):** Suggested or was asked to help with translating dialogue into "cowboy" style for the coin-stealing enemy, though Kaze ultimately uses ChatGPT for this. "I'm gonna ask Saschka Pity to translate this to cowboy."
    - **Chat Community (General):** Viewers provide real-time feedback, suggestions (e.g., Leela suggesting names), and engage in Q&A, influencing small aspects or providing moral support.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Coin-Stealing Enemy:**
    - Mechanic: Steals coins from the player. If caught, says "no" and runs off, spawning a Yoshi Coin.
    - Easter Egg: Can be "killed" in a secret way.
    - Pity Mechanic: If the player has zero coins, the enemy says, "wow, you're broke. I take pity on you. Here's a Yoshi coin for you."
    - Dialogue: Kaze works on its dialogue, using ChatGPT to get a "cowboy" feel.
    - Challenges: Implementing its running-off behavior, coin-stealing animation/visuals, tripping animation, and debugging its cutscene.
- **Yoshi Coins:**
    - Purpose: Replacement for traditional 100-coin stars. "Yes the Yoshi coins are our replacement for the 100 coin stars."
    - Design Goal: To be obtained through creative interaction with the environment, not just collection. "Tying reward to that hopefully fuels that like sense of exploration."
    - Reward Structure: Collecting all Yoshi Coins in a level awards a star. "if you find all of them in a level you get a star basically."
- **Technical Challenges:**
    - GCC Compiler "Note": A persistent, non-critical but annoying message related to multi-threading and FP register usage on the N64 that Kaze struggles to resolve. "every time i compile the game i get this issue it's not a real bug it's just a note."
    - Bug Fixing: Numerous bugs addressed during the stream, including coins not rendering, cutscenes not ending correctly, enemy AI pathing ("Why is he so goddamn fast? Oh, because he moves twice."), particle despawning, and train mechanics.
    - Optimization: Reduced Pokey enemy raycasts from ~31 to 1. "seems kind of excessive, yeah, I reduced it to one."
- **Level Design:**
    - Train System: Implementing trains that follow paths, have sound render radiuses, and ensuring they work correctly across area transitions.
    - Ambient Audio: Plans to "go over the entire game at the end and make sure that the ambient everywhere is perfect."
    - Player Guidance: Using environmental cues and enemy behavior to pique player curiosity.

## Business Aspects
- **Monetization Issues:**
    - Patreon: Experienced 1.5 years of being unable to receive payments, which was recently resolved. "Guys can you believe that after one and a half years of being unable to get payments from Patreon, they finally made it so that my account works again?"
    - PayPal: Still experiences issues with PayPal, with funds being frozen. "And Paypal still doesn't work. Fun fact, any money you send me on Paypal, I can't use it."
    - Alternative Platforms: Recommends Ko-fi over Patreon. "do not use Patreon, use Ko-fi or something. They take a smaller cut and they're not as dogshit to work with."
- **Sponsorships:** Actively looking for YouTube sponsors for video content. "I'm looking for a YouTube sponsor and then as soon as I have to sponsor I'll upload this [clip]."
- **Future Financial Planning:** Considers financial viability for future projects, leaning towards original game development in Unreal Engine as ROM hacking is "not a very lucrative project."
- **Copy Protection:** Briefly mentions the idea of implementing copy protection against bootleg cartridges. "I do wanna put some copy protection on against would like hearts on this."

## Key Quotes
- "So this guy basically he steals your coins and if you catch him stealing your coins, he basically says no and then he will run off. This is gonna be the last Yoshi coin in this level and after that it is time to make the collision work." (Highlights specific enemy dev, Yoshi Coin importance, and next steps)
- "yes the Yoshi coins are our replacement for the 100 coin stars... the thing about the Mario Sunshine 100 coin stars is that you get them by interacting with the environment in like creative ways and that's how I want the Yoshi coins to work as well." (Explains design philosophy for a core collectible)
- "Guys if you ever wanna make a Patreon, do not use Patreon, use Ko-fi or something. They take a smaller cut and they're not as dogshit to work with." (Candid advice based on personal negative experiences with funding platforms)
- "most likely it will be my own game made in Unreal Engine just cuz I have to think about the financial aspects as well." (Shows long-term thinking and the financial realities of indie/ROM hack development)
