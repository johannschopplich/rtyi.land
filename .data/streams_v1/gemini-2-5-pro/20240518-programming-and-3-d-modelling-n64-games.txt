## Game Development Process
- **Overall Progress:** The ROM hack ("the hex") is stated to be "just slightly over 80% done."
- **Current Focus (as per stream):** Development of "Course 13," an ice castle level. This involves greyboxing, creating 3D models for platforming elements, programming their behavior, and refining visual effects.
- **Development Stage:** The stream shows a micro-level iterative design process for specific mechanics within a level that already has a "general outline." This suggests late-stage development where individual components are being polished.
- **Key Milestones Mentioned:**
    - Planning level themes: "We already have the level themes planned."
    - Completing 3 out of 5 areas (mentioned by a chatter, Kaze acknowledges: "The factories and say no, only the office and boss area to go... And those are the smallest areas. So, that sounds pretty promising.") *Self-correction: This quote "3 out of 5 areas done" refers to a chatter's own project, not RTYI directly, though Kaze engages with it. The "80% done" is Kaze's direct statement about his hack.*
    - Kaze is systematically working on platforming elements for the ice level: "make all the platforming pieces, all the 3D models for it. And then to make fun platforming with it."

## Personal Insights
- **Identity as a Creator:** Kaze reflects on being seen as a "YouTuber" versus a "game developer": "Is this actually what my life has been this whole time? I've just been a YouTuber, not a game developer."
- **Design Philosophy:** Expresses strong opinions on official Nintendo games (e.g., Mario 64 DS: "a terrible game"; Yoshi's Island remake: disliking forced character switching), which likely informs his own design choices for "Return to Yoshi's Island" to address perceived flaws.
- **Development Challenges & Self-Doubt:** Articulates the frustration and uncertainty inherent in the creative process, especially with visual effects: "I feel like I've looked at this [ice platform effect] for so long that anything that doesn't look completely jarring at this point looks fine to me... would I hate it? I don't know."
- **Bug Fixing Philosophy:** Believes some bugs might resolve themselves over time or be fixed accidentally during other development work: "sometimes bugs just randomly get fixed like that."
- **Personal Life Impact:** Mentions his impending fatherhood ("going to have a kid in like two months") as a factor influencing other commitments like F3.

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub (Composer):** No direct mention of Badub or specific music contributions for "Return to Yoshi's Island" in this transcript. Kaze does discuss stream music choices (Super Paper Mario OST, avoiding B3313) and mentions uploading his game's OST in the future.
- **Biobak (Graphics Artist):**
    - Actively contributes ideas and assets: "Biobak's appearing path thing, yes. I definitely want that in here."
    - Kaze directly interacts with and iterates on Biobak's work during the stream, specifically a `.blend` file for an ice effect: "Okay, I'll check the blend you sent me... Biobak, is this what you were thinking?"
    - Provides visual solutions and inspiration for elements like the cracking ice platform.
- **Zeina (Animations) / Eiza:** (Kaze uses "Zana" when discussing his child's name, and "Zeina" is a known collaborator. "Eiza" seems to be the same person).
    - Involved in a "special plan" for a release video for "the slide" (a feature in the game), which Eiza wants to be "like a little bit of a documentary thing almost."
    - Has animation plans for game features: "grind rails and we still kind of have an animation plan for those."
    - Kaze comments on her potential as a video editor but notes she might not know the deep technical details of his work.
- **Other Contributors:** No other distinct, named contributors for "Return to Yoshi's Island" are explicitly mentioned as actively developing parts of the game in this transcript. Chat members provide suggestions and feedback.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Level Design (Ice Castle - Course 13):**
    - Brainstorming specific platforming mechanics: "Ice waves that move forward," "An ice platform that cracks," "Wind gusts," "A spinning ice shard," "Ice path that appears as you get closer."
    - Prioritizing core mechanics: "The ice platform that cracks. The spinning ice shards. And the wind gusts, I think those are the most important ones."
- **Cracking Ice Platform Mechanic:**
    - **Challenge:** Significant time and effort spent on designing, modeling, texturing, and animating a cracking/disappearing ice platform to look and feel right within N64 limitations.
    - **Iteration:** Multiple attempts at textures, shader effects (alpha blending, primitive colors, dithering), and particle effects (triangles, mist).
    - **Solution (in progress):** A multi-stage effect involving texture changes for cracks, a dissolve animation using shader manipulation, and particle effects for shattering. The goal is a 3-step process: initial state, cracked state, and broken/dissolving state.
- **Exploit/Mechanic Removal:** Kaze mentions accidentally fixing/removing a triple jump exploit and is "50-50 on whether I want it in the game."
- **N64 Technical Constraints:** Constant awareness and working within the N64's graphical and processing limitations, evident in discussions about shaders, texture sizes, and animation performance.
- **Atmosphere/Aesthetics:** Focus on making elements visually appealing and fitting the ice theme (e.g., discussion on crack colors, particle effects, reflection maps).

## Business Aspects
- **Marketing & Promotion:**
    - Planning release videos for game features: "Eiza wanted it to make like a little bit of a documentary thing almost... And then I'm making the release video for the slide."
    - Consideration of community showcases: "Actually, I don't know if I can do an F3 this year." (F3 is a major ROM hacking showcase).
    - Creating supplementary content: Developing a "satisfying Mario 64 clips" video, with discussion on effective thumbnails and titles to engage viewers.
- **Funding:** No direct mention of funding for "Return to Yoshi's Island." ROM hacking is typically a non-commercial hobby.
- **Release/Distribution:** While no specific release date is given, the "80% done" and talk of release videos suggest it's progressing towards completion. Distribution is implicitly through community channels typical for ROM hacks.

## Key Quotes
- "The hex is just slightly over 80% done I would say." (Provides a clear status on the overall project).
- "So, what our next goal is going to be, I think it's going to make all the platforming pieces, all the 3D models for it. And then to make fun platforming with it." (Outlines his development approach for level elements).
- "I feel like I've looked at this [ice platform effect] for so long that anything that doesn't look completely jarring at this point looks fine to me... But like if I actually just play the game and I saw this effect, would I hate it? I don't know." (Captures the developer's struggle and self-doubt during intensive work).
- "Eiza wanted it to make like a little bit of a documentary thing almost. So, I'm waiting for that to be settled first. And then I'm making the release video for the slide." (Highlights collaborative promotional efforts and a unique approach to showcasing game features).
