## Game Development Process
- **Overall Progress:** Earlier levels are "most of everything is done," though some pending tasks remain. Active development is focused on specific levels, such as a "space city" area and a snow level.
- **Development Stages & Workflow:**
    - Platforming mechanics are implemented first for new areas (e.g., "platforming for the first star done" in one section).
    - Visual polish follows the core mechanics.
    - Iterative design is common, with experimentation on visual elements (lighting, model shapes, effects).
    - Specific features like a "space taxi" and a "gramophone-shaped concert hall" are being designed and implemented for the space city.
    - Story elements are integrated into level progression (e.g., Shy Guy behavior changing after a boss, unlocking new areas).
- **Current Focus (during stream):**
    - Designing and modeling elements for a space-themed level (concert hall, walkway, space taxi).
    - Working on lighting solutions and effects (e.g., floor-mounted lights, pulsating floor lights, fake reflections).
    - Discussing character models (Peach, Toad, Luigi, Yoshi boss) and their implementation.
    - Fixing bugs and refining existing level geometry (e.g., making a platforming section easier).
    - A crash occurred during the stream, leading to some loss of progress.

## Personal Insights
- **On Perception of His Work:** Kaze expresses frustration when his work's impressiveness is qualified by "he has no budget and he works alone," feeling it might diminish the achievement.
- **Creative Control & Project Integrity:** He has very strong opinions about how his projects are handled, exemplified by his staunch opposition to an unauthorized PC port of "Return to Yoshi's Island." He states, "If I had the ability to just like slip my fingers and the PC port would be out of existence, I would do it."
- **Pride in Technical Skill:** Kaze is confident in his technical abilities, particularly regarding the N64's rendering engine which he wrote/modified extensively ("It's pretty easy for me to do it because I wrote the rendering engine basically.").
- **Development Philosophy:** He values an iterative approach, trying out ideas and refining them. He also mentions working as efficiently as possible.
- **Relationship with Hating/Criticism:** "I like hating on things, but I don't like if other people join me and hating on those things. Because then I feel like a bully."
- **On his YouTube Content:** He notes his videos have become more like "computer science lectures in disguise" and wishes they were more approachable, hoping the upcoming shader video will be.

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub:**
    - Role: Composer.
    - Contribution: Responsible for the game's music. Kaze states, "Yeah Badoob is doing the music. I can't do music at all."
- **Biobak:**
    - Role: Graphics artist/Model polisher.
    - Contribution: "Biobak goes over my models. After I'm done. And polishes them up. Brings a lot of ideas. And new concepts to the table." Helps refine the visual quality of Kaze's 3D models. Mentioned as someone who will "bail me out" if Kaze's initial model work is rough.
- **Zeina (referred to as "Say not" or "you" in chat during relevant segments):**
    - Role: Art and Animations.
    - Contribution: Provided the idea/drawing for a "mutant Yoshi" boss. Created the Peach and Toad models for a snow level. Kaze mentions, "I think you also wanted to do the animation so I left that for you" regarding the Peach model.
- **Other Contributors:**
    - **Dory:** Kaze discusses a collaborative project (referred to as "our compact" or "our computer") where Dory handles the majority of the work (~70%), including graphics updates, new combiners, UV mapping, and programming. This appears to be a separate project from "Return to Yoshi's Island."
    - **Kaze's Video Editor:** Mentioned in the context of YouTube finances ("I had to pay my editor like $500"). Not a direct RTYI game contributor but supports Kaze's content creation.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Level Themes & Features:**
    - Space City Level: Designing a concert hall (potentially gramophone-shaped), a space taxi system for traversal, and unique walkways (e.g., glowing floor tiles).
    - Story-driven Progression: Shy Guys' behavior changes post-boss, unlocking new areas and transportation (flying cars).
- **Visual & Technical Challenges:**
    - Lighting: Experimenting with lamp placement to avoid clipping and achieve desired effects (e.g., floor-mounted lights shining upwards). Creating pulsating light effects on floors that also illuminate Mario.
    - Reflections: Implementing a "fake reflection" effect for stars on a wall due to N64 limitations ("We obviously do not have the computing power. To actually reflect the stars.").
    - Model Detail vs. Performance: Designing assets like the gramophone to be "fairly low poly" and fit the "spacey aesthetic."
- **Gameplay & Difficulty:**
    - Adjusting platforming sections to make them less difficult or more intuitive ("I need to make this easier.").
    - Managing camera controls: Kaze notes conflicting requests from players and believes the current system is "as good as it could possibly be" without a complete redesign.
- **Specific Asset Design:**
    - Flying cars for Shy Guys: Iterating on the design to make it look futuristic and car-like, while managing polycount.
    - Gramophone concert hall: Brainstorming and modeling a low-poly, space-themed gramophone structure.

## Business Aspects
- **Funding:**
    - Primary income for SM64 hacking comes from Patreon: "Patreon. That's the majority of my income. From bar 64 hacking."
    - Supplemental income from YouTube: His channel made $940 in a recent period, with $500 going to his video editor. He considers this "kinda like a side job."
- **Release/Distribution:**
    - No explicit release plans for RTYI mentioned, but strong opposition to a community-led PC port suggests he intends to control its release, likely as a traditional ROM hack.
    - He mentions if he had *his own* game to release on Steam, he probably would, distinguishing this from a fan-made port of his ROM hack.
- **Marketing:**
    - No direct marketing plans discussed for RTYI. His YouTube streams and videos serve as ongoing public showcases of development.
    - A joking remark about marketing a "moon game" ("we will turn this into Not Mario 64 and market the moon game I guess") seems unrelated to RTYI.

## Key Quotes
- "I'm trying to like get all the platforming done and then afterwards maybe polish up the visuals a little bit." (Illustrates development workflow)
- "Biobak goes over my models. After I'm done. And polishes them up. Brings a lot of ideas. And new concepts to the table." (Highlights collaborative visual refinement)
- "Personally, I am not doing shit. I have nothing to do with the PC port. I want nothing to do with the PC port. If I had the ability to just like slip my fingers and the PC port would be out of existence, I would do it." (Emphasizes strong stance on project integrity and distribution)

## Potential Interview Topics
