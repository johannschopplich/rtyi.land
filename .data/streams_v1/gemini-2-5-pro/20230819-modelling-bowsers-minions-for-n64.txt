## Game Development Process
- Currently in active development of a specific level, referred to as the "Bowser protest" level.
- Focus on level design, including populating areas with collectibles (coins) to improve feel and reduce "deadness."
- Significant time spent on environment design, particularly the background (ocean, skybox, fog), involving multiple iterations to achieve the desired look and performance on N64.
- Ongoing optimization efforts for N64, including addressing polygon counts, render areas, triangle sorting, collision maps, and backface culling.
- Debugging various technical issues, including graphical glitches (shading, UVs), memory corruption, and performance bottlenecks.
- Integration of custom assets, such as 3D models for switches and cranes.

## Personal Insights
- Kaze finds his most recent work to be his favorite: "my favorite one is always the most recent level I made."
- He expresses strong opinions on technical subjects, e.g., his preference for C over C++ ("I think C++ is just a shitty version of C... There's one good thing in C++ and that is templates.").
- He conveys confidence in his problem-solving abilities, often having an idea of a bug's cause: "If you see a bug in my game, then I will likely already know what the solution is."
- He shows a sense of humor and engagement with his audience.
- Kaze mentions having a full-time job as a programmer alongside this project: "I have a full-time job on the side. So that's why I don't have too much time to just work on this all the time."

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub (composer):** Implied as the OST composer from the initial "Mario Party for OST today" comment. Kaze also mentions planning to pay musicians for music rights: "I was offering to pay the musicians as well, for like the rights to the music, once everything's done."
- **Biobak (graphics artist):** Provides 3D models (e.g., "Purple floor switch") and graphical assets. Kaze directly interacts with Biobak during the stream, importing his models and discussing visual designs like the skybox gradient. ("I will import your model right now... This is so much better than the one we had before.")
- **Zeina (animator):** Responsible for animations. Her absence was noted as a reason a character animation wasn't finished: "Unfortunately Zeina's gone today. Otherwise, she maybe would have finished the animation for the guy here."
- **Other Contributors:**
    - **Wiseguy:** Credited for creating the "Matrix Stack Fix," a tool used for implementing world lighting in Mario 64.
    - **Lila (chatter):** Actively provides real-time feedback, technical suggestions, and engages in discussions, influencing Kaze's immediate troubleshooting and design considerations (e.g., pointing out a shading issue, discussing Twitter monetization).

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Level Atmosphere & Population:** Conscious effort to make levels feel alive by adding elements like coins, addressing "dead" spaces.
- **Background & Skybox Design:** A major focus of the stream. Kaze iterated extensively on creating a convincing and performant ocean background, struggling with techniques like NBG (non-scrolling background), fog placement, culling, and texture scrolling before settling on a 3D model approach with dynamic positioning. ("I think the NBG is just not the possible here... I think the water has to be in the 3d model There's no way around it.")
- **N64 Performance Optimization:** A recurring challenge. Decisions are constantly weighed against N64 hardware limitations, including polygon counts ("This is an 8000 polygon level"), rendering techniques, and frame rates.
- **Asset Design and Integration:** Decisions on crane colors and switch models involved aesthetic choices and technical considerations (poly count, UV mapping). Biobak's improved switch model was adopted.
- **Bug Fixing:** Encountered and worked on various bugs, from visual glitches ("Why is it still not sharp") to more severe issues like potential memory corruption ("There's some memory corruption somewhere").
- **Lighting:** Discussed the challenge of world lighting in vanilla Mario 64 and the use of Wiseguy's "Matrix Stack Fix."

## Business Aspects
- **Merchandise Ideas:** Kaze discussed a merch company approaching him, leading to ideas for selling custom N64 boxes (without the ROM, for legality) and instruction booklets for "Return to Yoshi's Island" and other games. ("Dude, when I sell RGYI, I could just sell the box without the ROM, and it'd be legal.")
- **OST Sales:** Considered making a ROM that is just the Original Sound Track (OST) and selling that.
- **Humorous Speculation:** Jokes about becoming "millionaires" and forming a "full ROM making company" if merch sales are successful.
- **Twitter Monetization:** Briefly discussed Twitter's monetization program, though mostly in a skeptical and humorous way.
- **Paying Collaborators:** Mentioned offering to pay musicians for the rights to their music.

## Key Quotes
- "This is an 8000 polygon level. No render areas. We didn't even sort the triangles yet. Sorting the triangles will also give us a big performance boost." (Highlights the technical ambition and optimization process)
- "Dude, when I sell RGYI, I could just sell the box without the ROM, and it'd be legal. And then I would also make a ROM that's just the OST and sell that. Dude, we're gonna be fucking millionaires." (Shows entrepreneurial ideas and Kaze's characteristic humor)
- "I think the NBG is just not the possible here... I think the water has to be in the 3d model There's no way around it." (Illustrates the iterative problem-solving and making tough design choices after experimentation)

## Potential Interview Topics
- Explore the overall creative vision for "Return to Yoshi's Island" and how the "Bowser protest" level exemplifies Kaze's design philosophy for the game.
- Delve deeper into the collaborative dynamics with Biobak, Zeina, and Badub, including how creative ideas are exchanged and integrated into the project.
- Discuss Kaze's approach to balancing artistic ambition with the technical limitations of the N64, particularly the challenges and breakthroughs in environment and background design.
- Unpack the journey of identifying and overcoming significant technical hurdles, such as performance optimization and complex bug fixing (e.g., the N64 stability fix for RTYI).
- Elaborate on the seriousness and feasibility of the merchandise and OST distribution plans, and Kaze's broader thoughts on the sustainability of large-scale ROM hacking projects.
