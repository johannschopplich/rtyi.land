## Game Development Process
-   Ongoing iterative work on specific game areas, focusing on visual improvements (colors, skybox, thematic elements like the "birdhouse" concept) and level design.
-   A major upcoming milestone is the planned release of a public demo featuring "Course 1." This demo is intended to gather player feedback specifically on new physics and camera systems.
-   The demo release is tentatively scheduled within 3-8 weeks from the stream date, with an accompanying questionnaire (Google Doc) for players.
-   Existing content (like Course 1) is being polished and refined in preparation for the demo.
-   Kaze maintains a YouTube video production schedule, with an editor assisting, to share progress and build anticipation, aligning video releases with development milestones like the demo.
-   Debugging of N64 code is done using NEMU, which allows viewing assembly code.

## Personal Insights
-   Kaze is highly self-critical of his work, constantly evaluating and seeking to improve visual aesthetics and gameplay feel (e.g., "something about the colours here just look really good, I think this is really colourful, but the colours don't really pop").
-   He values thematic consistency, ensuring elements fit the "Yoshi's Island" motif.
-   Kaze expresses a strong desire for player feedback to validate and refine game mechanics, particularly core elements like physics and camera controls ("I want more data on gameplay... So that when I release the full game, we know for sure people like the camera and the physics.").
-   He openly shares personal reflections, including moments of self-doubt, concerns about cognitive function ("I've started to feel like my brain is really stupid"), and the impact of personal life (e.g., having a small child makes planning difficult).
-   He has a clear vision for how certain mechanics should feel, leading to detailed adjustments (e.g., the sliding speed soft cap).

## Collaborator Information
-   **Badub (composer):** While not explicitly named as the composer for the music played during *this* stream, Kaze praises the music ("I love this music too, the music's so good"), and Badub is his known long-term collaborator for music.
-   **Biobak (graphics artist, referred to as "Biomech" or "Biobak" in transcript):** Actively engaged in discussion with Kaze during the stream, providing feedback on visuals. Kaze seeks Biobak's opinion on graphical elements ("oh are you sure you don't want this Biobak, I think this looks really good now"). This indicates Biobak's involvement in the game's art and visual design.
-   **Zeina (animations):** No relevant information found in this transcript.
-   **Other Contributors:**
    -   **Violet:** Credited with an idea regarding level aesthetics ("this was Violet's idea, maybe the colours are ok but can be better" - referring to "Minecraft blocks").
    -   **Lila3TV (Lila/Leela):** A very active chat participant who Kaze frequently interacts with. Provides real-time reactions, suggestions (e.g., "Use RS" for emulators), and engages in banter. Kaze playfully asks her to "fix" Blender issues.
    -   **Editor (unnamed):** Kaze mentions having an editor who helps produce his YouTube videos, allowing for more frequent uploads.
    -   **"Redacted" (chat member):** Suggested a "cannon that goes to the sky" idea for level traversal.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
-   **Visual Design Iteration:** Significant time spent discussing and attempting to improve the visual appeal of a specific area, including colors, skybox (making it "Yoshi's Island related"), and overall theme (transforming an area into a "birdhouse"). Challenges include color matching, avoiding "clone vomit," and ensuring elements look cohesive.
-   **Mechanics Refinement:**
    -   **Sliding:** Updated sliding mechanics from vanilla Mario 64, implementing a soft cap at 95 speed instead of a hard cap at 100, to allow players to maintain momentum better.
    -   **Level Traversal/Progression:** Extensive discussion and live experimentation on replacing a simple pipe/hard-to-find slide with a new, more thematic mechanic for reaching a high area. This evolved into a "growing flower/vine" concept from Yoshi's Island. Challenges included:
        -   Making the interaction intuitive for players (how to signal it can be pulled/activated).
        -   Ensuring the climbing process isn't tedious, leading to the idea of an automatically spinning/upwards moving plant.
        -   Technical implementation of the growth animation and visual fading.
-   **Collectible System:** Replacing the traditional 100-coin star with a system of collecting six Yoshi Coins, which can be gathered at any time during other missions without losing progress.
-   **Tooling Challenges:** Encountering and troubleshooting issues with Blender (snapping behavior, edge splitting, vertex manipulation) and emulators (RS emulator flickering and crashing).
-   **Technical Graphics Issues:** Dealing with drawing order for transparent objects and attempting different methods to achieve desired visual effects like "dimmer layers" or fading objects into fog.

## Business Aspects
-   The game is explicitly a non-commercial ROM hack ("I will send you 0.01% of the money the game makes off of sales, which is zero").
-   The planned demo release serves as a method for gathering crucial player feedback and building community engagement, rather than for sales.
-   Kaze's YouTube channel and video releases are the primary means of "marketing" (i.e., raising awareness and sharing progress) and are strategically timed with development milestones like the demo.

## Key Quotes
-   "the skybox is so much better than before, and it's now Yoshi's Island related, which is very very good." (On achieving thematic consistency and visual improvement)
-   "I want more data on gameplay. I want more feedback for how people think the physics work and how the camera works and stuff like that. So that when I release the full game, we know for sure people like the camera and the physics." (On the purpose of the upcoming demo)
-   "We should have this guy [flower bud enemy] in the game anyway. Because he's from Yoshi's Island. And we're returning to Yoshi's Island. We'll have him here. And then you just jump on the leaves." (On incorporating thematic elements and brainstorming new mechanics)

## Potential Interview Topics
-   **The Core Vision of "Return to Yoshi's Island":** Explore Kaze's primary inspirations from Yoshi's Island and how he's translating those 2D concepts and feelings into a 3D Mario 64 environment. Discuss the origin of the project.
-   **Iterative Design and Community Feedback Loop:** Delve into Kaze's iterative design philosophy, how he approaches problem-solving for level design and mechanics (e.g., the birdhouse area, the flower vine), and specifically how he plans to use the demo feedback to shape the final game.
-   **Collaborative Dynamics in ROM Hacking:** Discuss the nature of collaboration with artists like Biobak, idea contributors like Violet, and music composers like Badub. Explore the role and impact of the live stream community and figures like Lila3TV on the development process.
-   **Overcoming Technical and Creative Obstacles:** Ask about the most significant challenges (technical limitations of N64, tool-related frustrations, design puzzles like player guidance) encountered while developing "Return to Yoshi's Island" and his strategies for tackling them.
-   **Integrating Yoshi's Island Mechanics:** Focus on specific design choices like the Yoshi Coin system or the planned growing flower mechanic, and the thought process behind adapting or creating these elements to fit both the Yoshi's Island theme and Mario 64 gameplay.
