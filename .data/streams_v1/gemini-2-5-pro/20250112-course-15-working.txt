## Game Development Process
- Current focus is on Course 15, specifically the factory level and its boss fight.
- The boss fight conceptualization and mechanics are actively being designed and iterated upon.
- A previous demo was released primarily to gather feedback on Mario's physics and camera controls.
- Development involves iterative design, where ideas are discussed, implemented, and refined (e.g., boss mechanics changing from destructive to healing).
- Kaze is actively working on level geometry, texturing, lighting, and enemy design for this course.
- There's an ongoing effort to balance visual detail with the N64's technical limitations and performance targets (e.g., 30 FPS).

## Personal Insights
- Kaze is highly self-critical of his own work and often seeks inspiration from other developers (e.g., "Dario").
- He expresses a strong passion for N64 development and its unique constraints, preferring it over modern platforms like the PC port for his own projects.
- He voices frustration with community pressure regarding the PC port of Mario 64, stating he avoids it partly out of "pure stubbornness" due to how insistent people have been.
- Kaze shows vulnerability regarding the growing audience on his "second channel," feeling it's becoming too public for its intended informal nature.
- He values creative freedom and making a "cool N64 game" above potential monetary gain.
- He reflects on the difficulty of achieving certain visual effects (like good reflections) on the N64.

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub (composer):** No specific mention of Badub's contributions to "Return to Yoshi's Island" in this transcript.
- **Biobak (graphics artist):**
    - Actively collaborates with Kaze on the boss fight concept for Course 15 ("me and Biobak we have been talking about a little bit the boss fight").
    - Provides visual ideas and drawings for the boss ("Biobak did draw something here but he sent me this idea here").
- **Zeina (animations):** No specific mention of Zeina's contributions in this transcript.
- **Other Contributors:**
    - **Dario:** A fellow developer whose visual work Kaze admires and uses as a benchmark or inspiration ("Dario made such a nice version of this").
    - **"asa" (chat member):** Provided a texture that Kaze implemented and liked for a building ("asa's texture actually made it look good").
    - **Alox:** Mentioned in relation to a potential co-op project ("X-Corp") and the PC port; Kaze directs inquiries about X-Corp to Alox.
    - **Rome_leader / Romeo King:** Mentioned as a potential source for 3D assets ("you can get them from romeo king and conglomerate that should be pretty safe").

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Boss Design (Mutated Yoshi):**
    - Initial ideas included a tentacle monster, then a mutated Yoshi with multiple tongues.
    - The concept evolved into a "heal the boss" mechanic: the Yoshi is mutated (cancerous growths/tumors), and the player destroys these tumors to cure it. This aligns with Yoshis being friendly and Sky Guys (local inhabitants) being the antagonists.
    - The boss will have attacks like ground pounds creating shockwaves, a tongue attack (licking/eating Mario), rolling into a ball, teleporting via black holes, and spitting acid puddles.
    - Baby Yoshis in the level will also have growths that the player can destroy, teaching the mechanic and having them react positively.
- **Visuals & Technical Limitations:**
    - Struggling to create convincing reflective surfaces without using N-Gons or mipmaps, due to N64 texture and combiner limitations.
    - Balancing detailed textures with performance and avoiding repetitiveness (e.g., i4 vs. i8 texture formats, color banding).
    - Ensuring platforming elements remain clear and playable despite visual details (e.g., judging slope angles).
- **Level & Arena Design (Course 15 Factory):**
    - Designing the boss arena with a hexagon-like pattern for movement and engagement.
    - Implementing lighting and atmospheric effects to enhance the factory setting.
    - The lore involves "Sky Guys" (not Shy Guys) who are scared of the mutated Yoshi boss.
- **Demo Strategy:** The demo was intentionally limited to Course 1-1 to focus feedback on core mechanics (physics, camera) and avoid revealing too much content.
- **Power-ups:** The game will feature power-ups like the Ice Cap, Wing Cap, Cloud Cap, and Bomb Cap. The Metal Cap is excluded due to Kaze's dislike of its "key-like" function.

## Business Aspects
- No direct mention of funding.
- The release of a demo served to gather feedback, which can indirectly act as community engagement/marketing.
- Kaze acknowledges that using the PC port might be financially beneficial ("I would probably make a good amount of money if I used the PC part for my stuff") but states his primary motivation is creative, not monetary ("I just want to make a cool N64 game").
- He is aware of his audience size and expresses some concern about his "second channel" becoming too popular for its informal nature.

## Key Quotes
- "The boss fight is basically the thing we have to like do next or plan out next so that's why the factory is there." (Shows current development focus)
- "But instead of killing the Yoshi you heal it oh, it's an interesting idea... yeah, actually that makes a lot more sense cuz like the sky guys are like the enemies, right So obviously you wouldn't want to help them and the Yoshi's are your friends... I think we'll do that." (Highlights a key design shift and rationale)
- "People have been so insistent and annoying about the PC port. That at this point, out of pure stubbornness, I want nothing to do with it... I just want to make a cool N64 game." (Explains his stance on the PC port and his primary motivation)
- "I'm trying to make this look somewhat reflective without actually using an nth map because if i use an nth map i can't use a texture and if i can't use a texture then there's no detail and looks like shit that's what i'm trying to do." (Illustrates the technical problem-solving process)

## Potential Interview Topics
- Explore the collaborative process with Biobak in designing the mutated Yoshi boss, from initial concepts to the "healing" mechanic. How are creative differences navigated?
- Discuss Kaze's philosophy on working within the N64's limitations. How do these constraints fuel creativity versus creating frustration, particularly in achieving desired visual styles?
- Delve into the decision to create a pacifistic boss resolution (healing Yoshi). How does this tie into the broader themes and narrative of "Return to Yoshi's Island"?
- Kaze's relationship with the ROM hacking community: How does he balance leveraging its positive aspects (feedback, shared resources, inspiration) with managing pressure and maintaining his artistic vision?
- What are Kaze's ultimate aspirations for "Return to Yoshi's Island"? What experience does he hope to deliver to players, and what does this project personally mean to him as a creator?
