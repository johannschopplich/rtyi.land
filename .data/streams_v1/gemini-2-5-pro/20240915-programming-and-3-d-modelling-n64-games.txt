## Game Development Process
- **Overall Progress:** The game "Return to Yoshi's Island" is in active development, with Kaze currently working on "Course 14," a craft-themed level. The game is planned to have 15 main courses ("quests"). Course 15 is reportedly "halfway done" with assets already programmed.
- **Major Milestones/Stages:**
    - **Level Design:** Focus on Course 14, involving asset creation (cardboard elements, lamps), enemy concepts (scissors), and environmental design (backgrounds, death floors).
    - **Demo Preparation:** A demo is planned, which will include a remake of "Course 1" being handled by Biobak.
    - **Remaining Work:** Side levels, an overworld, and the final Bowser level are still to be completed after the main courses.
    - **Optimization:** Ongoing efforts to optimize performance for N64 hardware, including addressing crashes and frame rate issues. Kaze notes that Course 14 "is gonna be very difficult to make run well on N64 because of how open it is."
    - **Asset Programming:** Assets for Course 15 were programmed based on a "slide deck" made with Eiza.

## Personal Insights
- **Passion for Game Development:** Kaze explicitly states, "For me, YouTube at this point. This the job part and like making the game is the fun part." This highlights his primary enjoyment in the creation process itself.
- **Perfectionism and Aesthetic Vision:** He shows a strong desire for visual quality and thematic coherence, frequently commenting on whether things "look good" or "unfinished." For example, "I don't want this to look unfinished, you know," regarding level elements.
- **Meticulousness in Content Creation:** When discussing a potential YouTube video ("why everyone was wrong about the N64"), he expresses caution: "I don't want to get it wrong, because it's very easy to get that wrong." This shows a commitment to accuracy.
- **Openness with Community:** Kaze openly discusses his development process, challenges, and even his YouTube video strategy with his streaming audience, valuing their input.

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub (composer):** No relevant information found in this transcript.
- **Biobak (graphics artist):**
    - Actively working on a "Course 1 remake" intended for the game's demo.
    - Contributes design ideas; Kaze mentions, "Biobak was suggesting that there would be like... That this whole thing would be inside a paper cylinder. And the paper cylinder is gonna have stuff drawn onto it. And I think that works really well."
- **Zeina (animations):** No relevant information found in this transcript.
- **Other Contributors:**
    - **Eiza:** Collaborated on a "slide deck" for Course 15, for which Kaze programmed assets. ("But quest 15 is also already halfway done because I already programmed all the assets for it, for the slide deck I made with Eiza.")
    - **Sauron:** Mentioned as "still working on RSP stuff," which informs Kaze's technical understanding of N64, though not directly for this game.
    - **YouTube Editor (unnamed):** Kaze mentions, "Yes, I have an editor now. It's not myself anymore," indicating he has hired someone for his YouTube video production.
    - **Chat/Community:** Kaze frequently interacts with and considers suggestions from his stream chat for design elements and optimizations.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Thematic Level Design (Course 14 - Craft Level):**
    - All elements are made of cardboard and craft materials (e.g., cardboard bridges, mountains, lamps).
    - Enemy ideas include scissors, tape, and glue mechanics.
    - Significant effort in creating appropriate textures for glue, paper, and backgrounds.
- **Death Floor Design:** A recurring challenge is making death floors clear and intuitive without breaking the aesthetic. For Course 14, he wants to avoid it looking like a "giant table" that implies a safe bottom area.
- **N64 Hardware Limitations:**
    - **Performance:** Constant struggle with frame rates, overdraw, and polycounts, especially in open levels. ("This level is gonna be very difficult to make run well on N64 because of how open it is.")
    - **Visual Effects:** Experimenting with "fake normal maps" to achieve a shiny paint look on N64.
    - **Technical Issues:** Dealing with Z-fighting, collision bugs (game crash mentioned due to "too many collision notes").
- **Iterative Design Process:** Kaze frequently tests and iterates on visual elements like textures for glue ("This is not cum stains, this is glue. Let me just make sure it actually looks like this in game. Looks like fuck."), backgrounds, and floor designs (trying paper water, aluminum foil, gift wrap paper).
- **Player Perception:** Concern that certain designs might mislead players (e.g., a desk-like floor suggesting it's walkable).
- **Background and Skybox:** Detailed discussion on creating a suitable background for the craft level, settling on a paper cylinder with drawn-on elements, and an "infinitely far away background" room (Toad House style) to contain the scene.

## Business Aspects
- **YouTube as a Job:** Kaze clearly views his YouTube channel as his primary work. ("For me, YouTube at this point. This the job part...")
- **Content Strategy and Monetization:** He actively tracks video performance ("This newest video... It's doing so well... This might be a 1 million view banger.") and plans future video content with audience engagement and algorithm appeal in mind ("I think the algorithm on YouTube likes a lot if you have like 30 minute videos").
- **Outsourcing:** Hired a video editor to help with YouTube production, indicating a business decision to scale or manage workload.
- **Marketing/Release (Indirect):** The demo featuring Biobak's Course 1 remake suggests a step towards showcasing the game. Discussion of re-releasing "Missing Link" also touches on distribution.

## Key Quotes
- "For me, YouTube at this point. This the job part and like making the game is the fun part." (Reveals motivation and passion)
- "The one reason I want to maybe not make this course be on a giant table is that if I do that, it looks like you can go to the bottom. And I want there to be a death floor. So maybe we need to innovate a different way to make a death floor look." (Highlights a specific design challenge and iterative thinking)
- "Oh yes, we're only at quest 14 out of 15. But of course there's some side levels missing, the overworld and the bowser level. But quest 15 is also already halfway done because I already programmed all the assets for it, for the slide deck I made with Eiza." (Provides a clear status update on game progress)
