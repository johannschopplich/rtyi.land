## Game Development Process
- The game is stated to be approximately 75% complete ("75 mean Quick 64. Yeah").
- Current focus includes integrating character assets (models, animations like Wiggler's) and programming their behavior.
- Development of specific levels and quests is ongoing, such as "Bowser's office," the "Union Mission" involving a strike and a "strike breaker" boss, and the "Wild West Valley" level.
- Work includes reworking existing levels for visual and performance improvements (e.g., the "Biobak" level).
- Implementation of new game systems like an options menu and Yoshi Coins (replacing 100-coin stars) is in progress.
- A significant amount of dialogue is being written and implemented (169 dialogues mentioned, more than double SM64).

## Personal Insights
- Kaze expresses a long-standing enjoyment of core Mario mechanics ("Dude ever since I was little I loved stomping Koopas").
- He reflects on the potential negative impact of AI on human creativity and purpose ("It's like why even try if something better can be done without any effort?").
- He is pragmatic about the risks involved in ROM hacking, such as timing game releases to avoid Nintendo takedowns ("I like to release my games around September and Just because that's the time where it's like least likely Nintendo's gonna take them down").
- He shows a desire to create unique and atmospheric experiences, focusing on level design and narrative elements like the "Union Mission."
- Kaze is candid about the challenges of development, including debugging and working within technical limitations.

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub (Composer):**
    - Provided a new song for the second Bowser level.
    - The music is designed with dynamic layers ("disable two channels and you get an indoors version and you can enable another channel to get an outdoors version") for atmospheric effect.
- **Biobak (Graphics Artist/Designer):**
    - Contributes 3D models and level design ideas.
    - Kaze consults with Biobak on concepts like the "conspiracy theory Yoshi room" and the aesthetics of the "child's room" level.
    - Described as "not a programmer. He does some 3D modeling on the air."
- **Zeina (Animator):**
    - Provides character animations, specifically mentioned for Wiggler (e.g., walk, jump, angry poses, stomping off).
    - Kaze was in the process of importing and integrating Zeina's new Wiggler animations during the stream.
- **Other Contributors:**
    - **Pileback:** Provided an "assessment" or suggestion for the "child's room model" area.
    - **Legwood:** Edits Kaze's YouTube Shorts.
    - **Chat members (general):** Kaze frequently interacts with chat, sometimes incorporating their suggestions or answering their questions related to game design. Lila is a frequently interacting chat member.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Level Reworks:** The "Biobak" level was significantly changed to feel more "vast" and "near infinite" with an improved cloud ocean and lighting.
- **Camera System:** Dealing with camera issues in tight spaces (like the elevator) is a challenge. Planned solutions include sphere collision for the camera and potentially fixed camera angles in specific locations.
- **Hitbox Design:** Approximating complex character shapes (like Wiggler) with N64's limited cylindrical hitboxes requires creative solutions ("What if he's just two cylinders like this?").
- **Quest/Narrative Design:** The "Union Mission" features a multi-stage narrative where minions strike, Bowser sends a "strike breaker," the plaza becomes ominous, and a boss (oil monster) attacks Mario.
- **Debugging:** A significant portion of the stream shows Kaze actively debugging various issues, such as elevator mechanics, object positioning (Toxboxes), and texture/animation glitches (Wiggler's face with Fast64).
- **Wiggler's Interactive Dialogue:** Wiggler's dialogue will change based on which parts of the construction site Mario has interfered with, serving as a hint system.
- **Technical Limitations:** Constant need to work within the N64's constraints regarding performance, rendering, and object complexity.

## Business Aspects
- **Release Strategy:** Kaze prefers releasing games around September, believing it's a time when Nintendo is less likely to issue takedowns.
- **Monetization/Distribution:**
    - He will not sell physical cartridges due to legal risks ("if I do I will get sued to shit").
    - He might sell merchandise like game boxes and instruction booklets, which could include a QR code for downloading the ROM (not from him directly).
- **Marketing:**
    - Uses YouTube Shorts for promotion, paying an editor ($5 per short).
    - Analyzes the cost-effectiveness of Shorts, noting they are not consistently profitable but hopes for viral hits.
- **Personal Finances:** Mentions personal financial situation (low income affecting house loan eligibility) which could indirectly influence his work setup.

- "I'm not gonna make a physical cartridge because if I do I will get sued to shit. But I might make a box and an instruction booklet and all that and I'm probably gonna sell those as merch." (On release and monetization plans)
