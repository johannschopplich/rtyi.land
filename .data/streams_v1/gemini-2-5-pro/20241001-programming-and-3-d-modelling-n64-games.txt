## Game Development Process
- **Current Focus:** Reworking "Chris 1" (Course 1) in preparation for a demo release. This involves integrating graphical updates, fixing rendering issues, optimizing performance, and importing updated actors.
- **Development Stages Mentioned:**
    - Fixing level geometry and rendering for Area 1.
    - Importing actors (models, animations).
    - Creating/implementing actor behaviors.
    - Performance benchmarking and optimization.
    - Bug fixing related to new asset integration.
- **Overall Progress:** The game has progressed significantly, with Kaze mentioning "we are in course 14," though the stream focuses on Course 1. The ROM size is nearing 64MB, a soft limit Kaze considers for N64 authenticity.
- **Milestones:**
    - Completion of Biobak's rework for Chris 1.
    - Upcoming demo release (planned to be just one stage).
    - Implementation of new physics features (e.g., Mario's nose).

## Personal Insights
- **On N64 Authenticity:** "But if you go over 64 MB, are you really still making an N64 game? I mean, you could argue you're making an N64 game because it runs on N64. But at the same time, it's kind of lame, right? It's like you're going beyond what they were able to do at the time. It just feels like cheating to me."
- **Pride in Visual Quality:** "I think I'm pretty sure this already is the prettiest N64 game there is. I don't think you can really make an argument against that."
- **Motivation for Streaming & Development:** "You need to realize my streams is like minimum effort. Really I just stream because I want to stream and because I like having people be able to give me feedback on this." He also mentions modding makes some money via YouTube/Patreon but it's not his main job.
- **Sharing Knowledge:** Kaze considers making a YouTube series analyzing the courses in "Return to Yoshi's Island" to share his thought processes and potentially gain insights.
- **Perfectionism & Problem Solving:** Spends considerable time fine-tuning details, optimizing, and debugging, often thinking aloud through complex technical issues.

## Collaborator Information
- **Bandu (Composer):**
    - Is creating new music for the game. Kaze plays some of Bandu's new tracks during the stream.
    - Music includes variations for different biomes within the game.
    - Quote: "Come to think of it, I actually have a new song as well. The thing of it though, Bandu made a bunch of new music."
- **Biobak (Graphics Artist - referred to as "Biobak" in transcript):**
    - Provided the graphical rework for "Chris 1" (Course 1).
    - Supplies updated 3D models and textures for various actors (Yoshi Egg, Goomba King, Spiked Goomba, Bouncy Flower, Bunny Goomba, Rabbits, Paragoomba, Retro Flag, Retro Pipe).
    - Makes design requests, e.g., for an "infinitely far background."
    - Kaze notes Biobak isn't modeling directly on N64, so Kaze handles N64-specific adjustments and bug fixing for imported assets.
    - Quote: "Today we are working on the rework of Chris 1 that Biobak just finished." / "This Biobak is not modeling directly on the N64, he's not gonna know what's going on."
- **Zeina (Animations):**
    - Not explicitly mentioned by the name "Zeina" in this transcript as the animator.
    - Animation work is discussed: Biobak provides some updated animations with models (e.g., Spiked Goomba's "Updated jump animation"). Kaze works on implementing and fixing animation playback ("I'm not animating correctly at all," "Fix spike Goomba animations").
    - The specific contributions of "Zeina" to animations are not detailed in this particular transcript.
- **Other Contributors:**
    - **Lina (Cat face Lina):** A community member Kaze consults on Blender and model merging issues ("Cat face Lina, do you remember what order Blenda will add these elements to her model, depending on how I merge?").
    - **Leela:** A chat participant Kaze engages with on technical details.
    - Various chat users (MariLuigi, VTARC, Sara, etc.) who interact and provide an audience.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Rendering & Optimization:**
    - Major challenge: Correctly ordering mesh elements and managing layout layers (especially "layout 0") for optimal rendering and to prevent visual glitches. ("Yeah, you can tell the drawing order here is pretty fucked").
    - Performance is a constant concern, with Kaze benchmarking FPS and CPU idle time after changes.
- **Asset Integration:**
    - Significant time is spent importing Biobak's models and fixing issues that arise, such as incorrect scaling, animation problems, or material properties not translating perfectly to N64. ("Every time I watch the game it's buggy, yeah? We literally just imported the rework of the course, of course there's gonna be some bugs").
- **New Features & Mechanics:**
    - Implemented "rigid body physics, or soft body physics" for Mario's nose.
    - Designing a spinning sun flare effect.
    - Planning changes to the Goomba King fight.
    - Yoshi Egg actor designed to spawn a coin star.
- **Level Design (Chris 1 specific):**
    - Implementing an "infinitely far background" as per Biobak's request.
    - Adjusting the position and appearance of elements like the sun and clouds.
    - Reworking actor placements and appearances within the level.
- **Working within N64 Limitations:**
    - Dealing with ROM size (approaching 64MB).
    - Adapting modern 3D assets for the N64's rendering capabilities (e.g., texture formats, lighting).
    - Kaze mentions specific N64 technical details like vertex buffers, RDP, and cycle types.

## Business Aspects
- **Funding:** "Modding makes me some amount of money through YouTube and Patreon. But it's not even half of what my normal job makes."
- **Release Plans:**
    - A demo release is planned, focusing on "Chris 1" (Course 1).
    - "The demo will just be one stage, nothing more."
- **Marketing:** No specific marketing campaigns discussed beyond his ongoing YouTube streaming and Patreon.

## Key Quotes
- "Today we are working on the rework of Chris 1 that Biobak just finished We're going to have to start first so we can do the demo release." (Highlights immediate goal and collaboration)
- "I think I'm pretty sure this already is the prettiest N64 game there is. I don't think you can really make an argument against that." (Shows ambition and pride in the project's quality)
- "This Biobak is not modeling directly on the N64, he's not gonna know what's going on. He doesn't know what's going to break and what won't." (Illustrates a core challenge of integrating externally created assets)
- "My ROM by the way right now is around 63 MB. So we are reaching the upper limit of how big a ROM can get. Which is good because we are in course 14." (Indicates progress and consideration of platform constraints)
