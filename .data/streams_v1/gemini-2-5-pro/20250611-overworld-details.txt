## Game Development Process
- **Overall Progress:** The project is in a mature stage, with major courses near completion. Course 7 has been finished and sent out for beta testing. The focus is shifting towards connecting the world (overworld design), implementing side levels, and bug fixing.
- **Major Milestones:**
    - Course 7 is complete and confirmed to work on real N64 hardware.
    - Luigi's model has been successfully imported into the game, signaling a significant new character addition.
    - A new quality-of-life feature, the "exit course" dialog after collecting a star, has been implemented.
    - The team is actively working on the overworld, with plans for it to be a single, large, dynamically loading level.
- **Release Timeline:** A tentative completion goal is the "end of the year," though Kaze acknowledges this is optimistic and dependent on external factors like his employment status.
- **ROM Size:** The game is currently around 59.9 MB, with a target size of 64 MB, indicating it is nearing its content-complete size.

## Personal Insights
- Kaze expresses significant frustration with the technical tools, particularly new versions of Blender, which he finds resource-heavy and buggy. This often leads to him spending stream time troubleshooting rather than creating content.
- He has a very candid and unfiltered communication style, frequently going on tangents about non-gaming topics like his dislike for Windows 11, his opinion on targeted advertising, and his critiques of philosophy and politics.
- He shows a deep commitment to the project running on original hardware, frequently mentioning performance and testing on N64. This purist approach is a core part of his development philosophy.
- He appears to value the collaborative, real-time feedback from his community and contributors, even when it leads to arguments or "death threats" (used hyperbolically), as seen in his interactions with Lila.

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub:** No relevant information found.
- **Biobak:** No relevant information found.
- **Zeina:** No relevant information found.
- **Other Contributors:**
    - **Lila:** A key technical contributor, heavily involved with the "Fast64" toolchain. She provides real-time support and debugging help during the stream, develops new features for the renderer (like decal emulation), and engages in technical debates with Kaze about implementation and bugs. Her work is crucial for the 3D asset pipeline.
    - **Sauron:** Mentioned in the context of a feature ("pack normals"), implying they are a contributor to the underlying tools or engine.
    - **Wiseguy:** Mentioned as the creator of tools that will help get the game running on the Analogue Pocket platform.
    - **Spooky Allua:** Mentioned as the creator of a visual novel engine. This seems unrelated to RTYI but shows Kaze's awareness of other community projects.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Technical Challenges:**
    - A recurring bug caused by a "write all" setting in Blender's repo settings, which kept re-enabling itself and causing visual glitches like Mario's hair to disappear.
    - Severe performance issues with Blender 4.1, leading Kaze to install and switch to a custom "F64 renderer" developed by Lila to improve viewport speed.
    - Issues with transparent decals and texture rendering in the new F64 renderer, which don't perfectly match the in-game output.
- **Key Design Choices:**
    - **Dynamic Overworld:** The decision was made to eventually combine all overworld sections into one large, dynamically loading map to ensure elements (like a large tree) are visible from multiple areas seamlessly.
    - **Luigi's Inclusion:** Luigi has been added to the game, but his exact function is still undecided. Kaze mentions co-op as the "coolest option," but a single-player unlock is also a possibility.
    - **Side Levels:** These are planned as smaller, distinct missions that can be developed quickly ("a day or two at most"). One concept mentioned is an oil tanker infiltration mission that unlocks a new level, "Oily Body Bay."
    - **Placeholder Assets:** Kaze acknowledges that some assets, like specific trees, are placeholders and not intended for the final game, highlighting an iterative design process.

## Business Aspects
- **Monetization/Funding:** Kaze discusses the possibility of getting a sponsor for a future "F3" (a community game showcase event he organizes). He states this would be the easiest way to justify the cost of making the event, specifically to pay his editor. This is related to his community work, not directly funding RTYI's development.
- **Release/Distribution:** The game will be a ROM hack, distributed for free. There is discussion about ensuring compatibility with various platforms, including real N64 hardware and the Analogue Pocket, indicating a desire for wide accessibility within the retro community.

## Key Quotes
- **On the development philosophy:** "Don't worry, we're targeting real hardware. We need an OST for today. Any wishes?" (This quote demonstrates the dual focus on technical authenticity and casual, community-driven development).
- **On the ambitious scope:** "After your pass is done, I'm going to make this all into one big level that loads dynamically as you walk through it. Because there's going to be stuff like the tree here that's going to be visible from multiple sides." (This highlights a major technical and design goal for the game's overworld).
- **On the chaotic collaboration:** "Leela is not a miner. I can give her death threats all I want... Wait, maybe we have to take back the death threats. Wait, maybe Leela was right." (This exchange, while hyperbolic, perfectly encapsulates the often-comedic, frustrating, but ultimately productive relationship Kaze has with his key contributors).

## Potential Interview Topics
- **The Creator-Tool Dilemma:** Explore the tension between wanting to use the latest development tools and the frustrations they bring (bugs, performance). How has the reliance on community-developed tools like Fast64 shaped the project?
- **Designing the Dynamic World:** Delve deeper into the decision to create a dynamically loaded overworld. What were the technical and creative motivations behind this, and what challenges does it present for an N64 game?
- **The Role of Luigi:** Discuss the origins of adding Luigi to the game. Was this a long-term plan or a recent idea? Explore the potential for co-op multiplayer and the technical feasibility of implementing it within the SM64 engine.
- **Collaboration in the Modding Scene:** What does the collaborative process look like on a large-scale ROM hack? How do you manage contributions and resolve technical disagreements with remote collaborators like Lila in real-time?
- **The Finish Line:** With the game's scope being so large (~120 tracks, multiple side-levels), what is the strategy for finalizing content and bug-fixing? How does he maintain motivation when facing so many small, frustrating bugs?
