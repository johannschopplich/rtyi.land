## Game Development Process
- The game "Return to Yoshi's Island" is a ROM hack based on the Mario 64 decompilation.
- Kaze is currently working on "Course 11," an oil rig themed level, focusing on creating assets (platforms, cranes, etc.) and implementing their mechanics.
- The project is described as being in the "end game now," with Course 11 being one of the later levels.
- Development involves a cycle of asset creation, mechanic implementation, level design, testing (often live on stream and on N64 hardware), and significant debugging.
- Kaze is also working on optimizing the game, including making his own "optimized libultra" and backporting optimizations.
- Progress can be incremental and sometimes slow, with dependencies like animations for a boss fight ("buzzer boss fight") causing delays.
- Future planned levels include a comic book world, a wild west valley, and a casino world.
- There's consideration for a retro pipe stage in Course 11, potentially based on "Smash 64 board to platforms."

## Personal Insights
- Kaze Emanuar has a strong design philosophy, preferring to curate the player experience rather than offering many options for fundamental mechanics: "I'm kind of against giving players options. I think it's weird to give the player an option to like select how the fundamental thing like that works."
- He values player freedom and discovery: "I think games should be about experiencing freedom... I wanna make the decision myself. I don't want the dev telling me, hey, do this, please."
- Kaze admits to a development habit of not always thoroughly testing code immediately to save time, which sometimes leads to bugs appearing later: "See that's the thing with me. I never test my code. I just assume it works... And sometimes, months later, a bug just occurs."
- He draws inspiration from other games, notably *Super Mario Sunshine* (Rico Harbor for Course 11's visual style) and *Super Mario Odyssey* (for lighting improvements).
- He expresses frustration with ads on Twitch, which was a primary reason for moving his streams to YouTube.
- Kaze demonstrates a willingness to iterate on design elements, such as level colors and fog, until he is satisfied with the aesthetic and feel.

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: The composer for the game's Original Sound Track (OST). Kaze states, "All of the OST is custom made by Badub. So, it actually is not copyrighted. Well, actually, there are some remixes of Mario songs."
- Biobak: There is no direct mention of "Biobak" with this specific spelling in the transcript. A "Biobak" is mentioned once: "The red makes it look like running red ash. That was Biobak's idea." This was a color suggestion for a graphical element (barrels on the oil rig). This might be the graphics artist referred to, or another contributor.
- Zeina (also referred to as Zayna/Zeina in transcript, likely Kaze's wife/partner present during the stream): Works on animations for the game. She is shown working on Bowser's walk cycle during the stream. Kaze discusses animation details with her, such as head movement related to Bowser looking at Mario. Her animation work is important for progressing elements like boss fights.
- Other Contributors:
    - Lila: Appears to be a collaborator working on animation tools or the exporter. Kaze asks her about "quaternion animations" and mentions "stuff in the exporter."
    - Nata: Credited with making the "HD Worms Fortress" textures, which Kaze then fixed up.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Lighting System:** A significant change involved adding light coming from the camera, inspired by *Mario Odyssey*, to make the game look brighter and improve readability of Mario, especially in dark areas.
- **UI Design:** The breath meter for swimming was intentionally placed in the middle of the screen, above Mario, to ensure players notice it, as opposed to a less central UI position.
- **Player Guidance vs. Freedom:** Kaze is hesitant to add features like trajectory lines for cannons if they remove skill or the "sense of freedom," preferring players to discover and master mechanics.
- **Aesthetics and Atmosphere:** Significant time is spent on visual elements like fog (color, density) and the color palette of levels (e.g., the oil rig level's colors were iterated upon to avoid looking like lava and to achieve a more "rich" feel).
- **Bug Fixing and Technical Issues:** Recurring challenges include debugging game mechanics (e.g., broken ziplines, cannon reticle issues), addressing collision problems, and fixing visual glitches on N64 hardware related to changes like "clip ratio" adjustments. Kaze often debugs these live.
- **N64 Hardware Limitations:** Development includes testing on actual N64 hardware, leading to discoveries of performance issues (FPS drops) and graphical anomalies that need to be addressed.
- **Asset and Mechanic Design:** The stream shows the process of designing and implementing various platforming mechanics for Course 11, such as moving platforms, rotating cranes, and seesaws, including deciding against some ideas like "piles of dirt" on an oil rig.

## Business Aspects
- **Streaming Platform Choice:** Kaze explicitly states he switched from Twitch to YouTube for streaming due to Twitch's ad policy: "The reason I don't want to stream on Twitch anymore is that I find it personally unwatchable with all the ads."
- **Audience Engagement:** Kaze demonstrates awareness of YouTube algorithms and engagement tactics, such as intentionally including "mistakes" in his videos to encourage comments. ("I just said 37, because I thought someone would notice and comment on that for the algorithm.")
- **Release Timeline:** Kaze indicates the game will not be released "this year" (referring to the stream's context), as he wants to release it "when it's actually completely finished" and acknowledges he doesn't have unlimited time to work on it.
- **Monetization:** While not a commercial product, Kaze has YouTube channel memberships (a viewer becomes a member during the stream). There is no mention of direct funding for the game's development itself.

## Key Quotes
- "See, I'm kind of against giving players options. I think it's weird to give the player an option to like select how the fundamental thing like that works." (Reflects Kaze's design philosophy)
- "Basically, I added the light coming from the camera back... which makes the whole game look a lot brighter. Because I noticed the game is looking pretty dark." (Highlights a significant technical and design change)
- "So man it feels crazy that we're already in quest 11. We're actually just in the end game now for the mod." (Indicates project progress and Kaze's perspective on it)
- "See that's the thing with me. I never test my code. I just assume it works. And it saves me a lot of time. And usually it does. And sometimes, months later, a bug just occurs and it's like, yeah, now I have to prove that I didn't mess up." (Reveals his development approach)

## Potential Interview Topics
- Explore Kaze's overarching vision for "Return to Yoshi's Island" and how it differentiates itself from other SM64 ROM hacks or his previous projects.
- Delve into the collaborative process: How does Kaze manage and integrate contributions from Badub (music), Zeina (animations), and others like Lila or Nata? What are the dynamics of this distributed, informal team?
- Discuss the challenges and triumphs of heavily modifying the SM64 engine, including the development of an optimized libultra and pushing the N64 hardware's limits.
- Kaze's philosophy on game difficulty, player guidance, and freedom, and how these principles are specifically applied in "Return to Yoshi's Island."
- The impact of live-streaming the development process on Kaze's workflow, design decisions, and community engagement.
