## Game Development Process
- Kaze is actively working on preparing a demo for "Return to Yoshi's Island" (RTYI), though a release date is not set. He mentions getting it "mostly released ready off stream."
- Current development focus includes programming objects and designing a specific "space area" or "arcade" level, which involves implementing features like teleportation platforms, low gravity zones, and dynamic visual effects.
- Performance optimization is a key concern, with efforts to ensure the game runs well on original N64 hardware (aiming for 20-25 FPS in demanding scenes) and targeting 60 FPS on Steam Deck for a potential PC version.
- Kaze follows an iterative development approach: outlining level concepts, programming necessary elements, experimenting with placement and mechanics to find what is "fun," and then polishing.
- A significant part of the process involves replacing original Super Mario 64 code, which Kaze deems inefficient ("dog ass"), with his own optimized versions.
- The game is built upon the Mario 64 decompilation, allowing for deep engine modifications.
- Kaze mentions having "the overworld and 2 or 5 side levels" left for the demo, with most side levels being small.

## Personal Insights
- Kaze expresses a strong opinion on the inefficiency of Nintendo's original SM64 code, motivating him to rewrite parts of it for better performance.
- He reflects on game difficulty, stating, "I like putting super hard things in my games... The problem with that is that a lot of the time players do encounter it... So I wanna prevent that," indicating a desire to balance challenge with player accessibility.
- Kaze is contemplating the future of his work beyond ROM hacking, including the possibility of releasing an original IP version of RTYI: "What if, along with RTYI, I also release a game that is 90% the same content, but we replace all the Nintendo IP with our own?"
- He shows pride in achieving complex technical feats on the N64, such as running demanding levels on actual hardware: "Did you think this could run on the N64?"
- Kaze discusses his preference for low-level programming when necessary but also the desire to avoid it if higher-level solutions are viable and efficient.

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub (composer):** No direct mention or information about Badub's contributions in this transcript.
- **Biobak (graphics artist):**
    - Kaze mentions, "Considering Biobak is reworking all my stuff anyway. I should just leave it to him," specifically in the context of textures. This suggests Biobak is responsible for overhauling or finalizing the game's textures.
- **Zeina (animations/models/art):**
    - Zeina created a "carpenter" model: "What do you think of this carpenter that Zeina made?"
    - Zeina also designed a carpet texture: "By the way, what do you think of the carpet? I made this earlier today... Your cool carpet is right here, Zeina." (Kaze later says "I made this earlier today" referring to the carpet, but then attributes it to Zeina. It seems Zeina made the visual and Kaze implemented it, or there's slight confusion in the live commentary).
    - Zeina is also credited with "texts" in the game: "Also loving the text. The text are good, aren't they?"
- **Other Contributors:**
    - **Wiseguy:** Mentioned as someone Kaze trusts for work related to "N64 Recomp."
    - **UAD:** A past collaborator Kaze has worked with "a lot," mentioning using levels from Tonic Trouble in joint modding projects.
    - **Malon & Brodude:** Developers in the N64 community whose successful Kickstarter Kaze comments on, noting their high backer contribution average. Not direct RTYI collaborators but influences/peers.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Visual Style & Aesthetics:** Kaze is actively working on the visual style of levels, experimenting with textures (e.g., carpets, platform surfaces), lighting, and color palettes to achieve a specific "arcade-y" or "space" theme. He sometimes struggles with making elements fit, "I hate the yellow. Yellow is so fucking ugly, oh my god."
- **Level Mechanics:** Development of unique gameplay elements such as:
    - Teleportation platforms with custom animations (Mario scaling into the ground instead of using transparency).
    - Low gravity zones with distinct visual cues.
    - Dynamic lighting effects tied to platforms.
- **Technical Challenges & Bug Fixing:**
    - Dealing with rendering issues, such as a bridge not being visible or textures not displaying correctly ("Something doesn't make sense. It shouldn't be solid right now, but it is.").
    - Optimizing performance on N64 hardware, leading to decisions like disabling Mario's transparency to avoid graphical conflicts ("if I don't do this, then we have to use transparency, and I don't want to re-enable transparency on Mario's model, because it would mess with all my components").
    - Working around engine limitations and unexpected behaviors ("This is confusing because when I set the tile scroll here it worked fine.").
- **Original IP Adaptation:** A significant design consideration is how to adapt RTYI into a game with original IP, which would involve changing the main character, movement, and other Nintendo-specific elements. "Of course, I would change the movement and stuff like that too, so it would functionally be a different game."

## Business Aspects
- **Potential Commercial Release:** Kaze is seriously considering releasing a version of the game on Steam using "Recomp" (N64 Recompilation). This version would have all Nintendo IP replaced with original assets to be legally sellable. "That way we would legally own it. And I would maybe be able to use Recom to sell it on Steam or something."
- **IP and Rights:** Kaze is aware of the legal limitations of using Nintendo IP for profit. "To make a physical card, I would need the rights to Super Mario 64 first. I don't have them currently."
- **Demo Strategy:** Releasing a demo is seen as a valuable way to gather player feedback and improve the game. "Doing demos is a good way to get a lot of latest data, which is very important for making the game better."
- **Market Observation:** Kaze observes trends like Kickstarter successes in the N64 homebrew community (e.g., Malon & Brodude's project) and notes strategies like high-value backer tiers for personalized NPCs.
- **Demo Release Timing:** Kaze plans to delay the RTYI demo release to avoid clashing with another developer's (Robot's) Christmas release.

## Key Quotes
- "What if, along with RTYI, I also release a game that is 90% the same content, but we replace all the Nintendo IP with our own? That is the idea. And that way we would legally own it." (Highlights the dual-nature of the project and commercial ambitions).
- "There is some original Nintendo code left, but I am planning to replace it. Not even because I want to replace all the Nintendo code, just because the code is complete dog ass." (Shows his technical drive and rationale for deep engine changes).
- "First, I make an outline of the things I want in the level. Then I think about how I can make the level fun in the way that I envision. And then I program all the stuff that I want for that. And then I just start moving it around and see what's fun." (Explains his iterative game design philosophy).
