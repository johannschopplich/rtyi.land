## Game Development Process
- **Current Stage:** Nearing completion of all main courses, with Course 15 being the final one actively under development during the stream. Kaze mentions, "all the main courses will be finished. That will feel so good."
- **Next Phases:** Post-main course completion, the project will move into "polishing content," followed by extensive beta testing, fixing old levels, and then developing the overworld and side levels.
- **Specific Progress:**
    - Course 15 boss fight mechanics and visuals are being finalized and debugged.
    - The "inside of the rocket" sub-area in Course 15 is being detailed, including a multi-room spaceship layout (computer room, specimen room, engine room, observatory).
    - A "retro section" for Course 15, themed after Super Mario 64, is being planned, involving combining iconic elements from multiple SM64 levels.
- **Iterative Nature:** Development involves significant iteration, bug fixing (e.g., smoke effects, enemy spawning, BLJ crashes), and refinement of existing content. Kaze notes, "This is what happens when you keep changing the engine, all the levels just break," highlighting ongoing technical adjustments.
- **ROM Size:** The game is currently 58.8 MB, with Kaze aiming to keep it within a 64MB N64 cartridge limit, stating, "It does fit on a 64 megabyte cartridge. I'm making up my limits."

## Personal Insights
- **Design Philosophy:** Kaze has a clear vision for player experience, emphasizing "edging the player" by teasing rewards and creating anticipation. He strongly opposes adding excessive options, believing it clutters the game: "There's one thing where I will consistently disagree with the people asking for stuff and that is options... if I added everyone's request for options, I would have an option menu with 260 items and it would be shit."
- **Reflection on Work:** He acknowledges the demanding nature of the project and sometimes marvels at his own productivity: "Dude, it feels like I did so much stuff since the last time I streamed. How how was I so productive?"
- **Community Interaction:** Kaze actively engages with his chat for feedback and ideas ("What do you think?") but ultimately maintains creative control. He's candid about the limitations of feedback, especially in later stages: "a lot of the feedback I'm getting now is like either super nitpicky or contradicting another feedback I got."
- **Openness and Boundaries:** He has a clear policy on sharing his work: "If you are able to use my stuff without my help, then you're free to use it."

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub (Composer):** No specific current contributions to RTYI mentioned in this transcript. Kaze mentions "The first track there is always really fun custom music" generally, and discusses composers for a different game (Last Impact).
- **Biobak (Graphics Artist):**
    - Responsible for 3D models and graphics, including the main boss model ("I purposefully did not fully import it yet because I figured Biobak had changes to it").
    - Provides feedback on visual elements, such as UV mapping issues in the spaceship level ("There's cogs here, but you cannot see the cogs because the UV mapping is sucky as Biobak said").
- **Zeina (Animator):**
    - Works on animations for game elements, such as the "baby Yoshis" in the Course 15 boss fight ("Zayna's currently animating them. So hopefully they will be better once they are animated.").
- **Other Contributors:**
    - **Hazer:** Guest author working on a "little side level," described as "sliding on wind and there's flowers everywhere. It's very pastel colored."
    - **Martiste:** Guest author for "a few of the levels."
    - **Azawaza:** Designed a level shown on stream, noted for its "very pastel color, very Yoshi's Island" aesthetic. Kaze mentions, "This is what he's planned for this game."
    - **Unnamed individual:** Contracted to create YouTube shorts for Kaze's channel for $5 per short.
    - **HooliKaleb (Community Member):** Offered to convert .skp files (SketchUp models of SM64 levels) to .obj for Kaze to use in the retro section.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Boss Design Iteration (Course 15):**
    - Initial concept for the mutated Yoshi boss involved "tumors," which was changed to "mushrooms" after feedback that tumors were "way too disgusting."
    - The boss arena concept evolved significantly from a "stupid factory" to a destructible planet, an idea suggested by a viewer which Kaze embraced: "Planet is cooler." This involves complex visual effects like the planet breaking apart.
- **Level Mechanics:**
    - Implementation of platforms that "get hot periodically" requiring timed movement.
    - Designing the spaceship interior with a sense of discovery and progression through distinct themed rooms (computer, specimen, engine, observatory).
- **Retro Section (Mario 64 Themed):**
    - Initial idea was to include all main SM64 areas, but this was deemed "too big." The scope was narrowed down to "snippets" or "highlights" from selected courses (e.g., Bob-omb Battlefield bridge, Whomp's Fortress tower, Jolly Roger Bay boat elements, Cool Cool Mountain cabin/slide, etc.).
    - Challenge of converting old SM64 level rips (.skp files) for use.
- **Technical Challenges:**
    - Ongoing bug fixing: visual glitches (e.g., sparks, smoke effects not rendering correctly), animation issues (portal animation broken), gameplay bugs (BLJ crashes).
    - Engine modifications leading to older content breaking: "This is what happens when you keep changing the engine, all the levels just break."
    - Performance optimization: Ensuring effects like smoke are not too resource-intensive ("make it only render if it's actually in view"), and being mindful of rendering costs for elements like "small splashes on the floor."
- **Swimming Mechanics:** Kaze feels standard Mario 64 swimming isn't ideal for RTYI's smaller water areas and aims for more direct control.

## Business Aspects
- **Monetization/Funding:**
    - Kaze accepts donations, expressing a preference for PayPal over YouTube due to YouTube taking a "large cut."
    - He outsourced the creation of YouTube shorts for his main channel at a rate of "$5 per short."
- **Marketing/Distribution:**
    - While not explicitly commercial, Kaze is mindful of the ROM size ("58.8 megabytes"), keeping it within a self-imposed 64MB limit, relevant for potential N64 hardware play.
    - Demo feedback is considered, though Kaze feels he has received most of the useful feedback for the current demo.

## Key Quotes
- "Oh my God, dude, all the main courses will be finished. That will feel so good." (Reflecting on a major development milestone).
- "I've come to realize that it's very important to constantly edge the player. So that's what we're doing." (Explaining a core game design philosophy).
- "That would also be lower poly than my whole stupid factory here. And I hate that I have this whole factory here actually... Planet is cooler." (On making a significant design change based on a better idea).
- "This is what happens when you keep changing the engine, all the levels just break." (On the challenges of iterative development and engine modification).
