## Game Development Process
-   Currently working on "Course 11" (internally referred to as "Bozo's Tower" or "Oily Boily Bay").
-   Engaged in significant reworking and improvement of earlier game content, including Course 1 (Deep Dives Through the Dorms, Turtle Street, Deep Sea Dive, Bomb Cat's Secret) and the Mario Bros. 3-themed retro 3D section in N-Curse 2.
-   The game has undergone substantial changes from its demo version, with levels being completely reworked for better design, higher framerates, and improved camera behavior.
-   Kaze maintains a "to-do list" and is systematically going through it, fixing random issues and making improvements from early courses up to recent content.
-   Development involves iterating on level design (e.g., widening walls for camera, adjusting slide mechanics), gameplay mechanics (e.g., breath meter duration), and visual elements (e.g., textures for Bozo's Tower).
-   Performance considerations on N64 hardware are a factor, with Kaze noting that the overworld is approaching its limit for adding more elements without lag.

## Personal Insights
-   Kaze is deeply passionate about ROM hacking and game development, willing to work "70-hour weeks" balancing this project with his full-time job as a video game programmer.
-   He has a strong vision for the game, aiming to create something substantial and high-quality that is "not just a meme" and will have long-term appeal.
-   He holds firm opinions on programming fundamentals, advocating for learning assembly before C for a proper understanding.
-   Kaze values world-building and creating interesting settings in games and fiction.
-   He acknowledges his workflow involves remembering a lot of details and having a strong vision, which can lead to arguments but also contributes to his effectiveness.

## Collaborator Information
-   **Badub (composer):** No relevant information found in this transcript.
-   **Biobak (referred to as Biobak in transcript - graphics artist):**
    -   Collaborated extensively with Kaze on UI elements, particularly the power meter (health meter).
    -   Engaged in an iterative design process ("a lot of back and forth") to achieve specific color accuracy and visual appeal for sprites, aiming to prevent unwanted brightness shifts.
    -   Provided new assets for the power meter and a Bowser logo for "Bozo's Tower."
-   **Zeina (referred to as Zayna in transcript - user noted as animator, but role not detailed in this transcript):**
    -   Kaze's partner, present during the stream and participates in personal conversations (e.g., rescuing a bird, plans for board games).
    -   Her direct animation contributions to "Return to Yoshi's Island" are not specifically detailed in this transcript.
-   **Other Contributors:**
    -   **Lila:** Provided a "new quaternion system" that could enable smoother Mario animations. Kaze also showed her the new UI pop-in animation.
    -   **UED:** A past collaborator who Kaze worked with, noted for a strong love of Banjo-Kazooie games, which influenced some past hack designs.
    -   Stream chat members (various names mentioned): Provide suggestions (e.g., level names like "Oily Boily Bay") and engage in discussions.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
-   **Camera Improvements:** A recurring challenge. Solutions include redesigning levels (e.g., wider walls in N-Curse 2 retro section) and exploring new microcode to disable near clipping. New camera controls were also implemented (C-button rotation, D-pad slow rotate, R to center).
-   **Level Reworks:** Significant portions of the game, including early levels and retro sections, have been completely remade to improve gameplay, visuals, and address issues like camera squishing.
-   **Breath Meter Mechanics:** The duration was intentionally made shorter than vanilla Mario 64 to prevent players from too freely exploring underwater areas without utilizing Koopa shells, thus guiding the intended gameplay.
-   **UI Design & Implementation:**
    -   Detailed iteration on power meter visuals with Biobak to ensure color consistency.
    -   Implemented new power meter sprites and added animations like scaling in on appearance and smooth refilling.
    -   The breath meter uses a technique involving alpha thresholds on textures to create a smooth circular progress effect.
-   **Level Naming:** An iterative process, with Kaze eventually settling on "Oily Boily Bay" as a temporary (but liked) name for Course 11, preferring names that are alliterative or rhyme.
-   **Performance on N64:** Kaze is mindful of N64 limitations, particularly RDP (Reality Display Processor) and potential lag in graphically intensive areas like the overworld as more content is added.
-   **New Feature Idea:** A dream inspired a new side-feature: hiding three Toads in the overworlds, who, when collected, will play a song.
-   **Bozo's Tower (Course 11 / Oily Boily Bay) Design:**
    -   Conceptualized as a corporate office/oil rig for Bowser.
    -   Specific gameplay elements planned: an entry point, Star 1 area, a "minion strike," a boss fight involving knocking Bowser's head off, and a sequence where a giant owl block (Bowser strike breaker) eats the player.
    -   Ongoing work on texturing and adding a Bowser logo to the tower.

## Business Aspects
-   Kaze explicitly states that "ROM making is not that lucrative."
-   He has a full-time job as a programmer at a video game company, which "pays my bills."
-   "Return to Yoshi's Island" is a passion project, not developed with primary commercial intent. No specific marketing, funding, or release/distribution plans beyond community streams are mentioned.

## Key Quotes
-   "I've been making improvements to the game this week. Just like going back, fixing all the random stuff... I basically just went over my to-do list from course 1 all the way up until recent." (On his development focus)
-   "You might say I'm stuck up for actually making sure that my game is not just a meme, but... this is what I want in my life. I want a game that keeps me occupied for the long term." (On his quality standards and motivation)
-   "Me and Biobak, we went through a lot of back and forth to get these colors exactly right. Because I didn't want the brightness to increase from blue to green." (Illustrating collaborative detail)

## Potential Interview Topics
-   **The "Why" Behind the Grind:** Explore Kaze's deep-seated motivations for dedicating immense personal time to a non-commercial ROM hack while managing a full-time game development career.
-   **Evolution from Demo to Final Vision:** Discuss the significant reworking of early content. What were the key learnings or shifts in design philosophy that prompted these large-scale changes from the initial demo?
