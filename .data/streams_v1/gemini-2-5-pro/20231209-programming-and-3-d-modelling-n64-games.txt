## Game Development Process
- The game "Return to Yoshi's Island" is actively in development, with significant progress made on multiple courses (Course 9, 10, and 11 mentioned as substantially completed during a hiatus from Twitch).
- Kaze is currently working on a course tentatively named "Oily Boily Bay."
- A key feature is the inclusion of "retro bit sections" in each of the 15 main courses, inspired by games from the N64 era or earlier. The current focus is on a "Board the Platforms" (from Smash 64) retro section.
- New engine features have been implemented, including 16 different floor surface types (grass, water, stone, mud, wood, steel, glass, leaves, squishy, grates) with distinct properties.
- Future planned retro levels include inspirations from Mario Paint, Dr. Mario, and Super Mario Land 1.
- Other planned major level themes include Wild West Valley (with boss fights), a potential music level, an oversized casino level, and a comic book-themed world.

## Personal Insights
- Kaze expresses hope to release the game in 2024 but acknowledges uncertainty: "Game of the year 2024, I hope I can release it 2024, I don't actually know."
- He is candid about his creative process, including moments of frustration and self-criticism: "I think this was not a good idea... I hate this. That looks so bad." Followed by renewed enthusiasm for new ideas: "I have THE idea. The best one yet."
- Kaze is proud of the project's progress and enjoys sharing it with his audience: "Dude, yeah, I'm so happy with the new redesign. You guys miss like all of course 10, course 9, course 11."
- He reflects on his streaming platform choices and audience engagement strategies, indicating a pragmatic approach to his online presence.
- He has a strong vision for specific aesthetics and gameplay feelings, particularly for the retro sections, striving to make them "look like a high-quality version" of the originals.

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub:**
    - Role: Composer.
    - Contribution: Has created songs for "all these areas" in the game. Kaze praises the music: "And the songs are a banger."
- **Biobak:**
    - No relevant information found in this transcript regarding Biobak's contributions as a graphics artist.
- **Zeina (Zayna):**
    - The transcript mentions Zeina/Zayna primarily as a viewer Kaze knows ("I see a message from Zeina"), a close acquaintance (references to watching movies together, a personal joke), and a colleague at "Gears for Breakfast."
    - The prompt lists Zeina for animations, but this transcript does not detail her specific animation contributions to "Return to Yoshi's Island."
- **Other Contributors:**
    - **Lila/Lilo:** A frequent and recognized chat member who provides feedback and engages in discussions with Kaze. Appears to be part of the inner circle/testing community.
    - The general Twitch and YouTube chat community: Provides real-time feedback, asks questions, and offers moral support/engagement, which Kaze acknowledges and sometimes responds to by adjusting development or explaining decisions.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Retro Level Design:** A major focus is adapting 2D or older 3D game concepts (like Smash 64's "Board the Platforms") into fully 3D playable sections within the Mario 64 engine. This involves significant creative and technical problem-solving.
    - Challenge: Creating the "Board the Platforms" background involved multiple iterations, from considering 3D spheres to squares, then to projecting textures onto a large UV sphere to balance visual fidelity with performance. "The question is, how do we best make this background work?"
- **Technical Hurdles:**
    - **Performance:** Constant concern, especially with transparency and complex visual effects. "This is gonna need so much performance."
    - **Rendering Issues:** Dealing with Fast64's specific rendering of transparency. "Fast 64 doesn't render transparency right."
    - **Memory Management:** Encountering potential memory limitations in levels. "We might be running low on memory in this level."
    - **Bugs:** Diagnosing and fixing graphical glitches, such as an issue with a pipe ("I think there's a lava bubble spawning inside the pipe") and unexpected character behavior ("Why can't I move? Is it because of all these condition triangles?").
- **Surface Interaction System:** Implementing a system with 16 distinct floor types, each with different properties ("Every surface has a type that is a bunch of different flags on what should be active").
- **Camera System:** Discussed refining the player-controlled camera, balancing responsiveness for precise adjustments versus smooth movement for general use.
- **Level Layout and Platforming:** Actively designing platforming sequences for the "Board the Platforms" section, focusing on jump distances, platform movement, and overall flow, using a "block out technique" initially.

## Business Aspects
- **Release Goal:** Kaze hopes for a 2024 release but is not certain.
- **Marketing/Promotion:** He recognizes the value of virality for discoverability: "Yeah, that's what you want. You want the virality of your video being sent to other people."
- **Audience Engagement:** Uses multistreaming to Twitch and YouTube to maximize reach and engagement, even joking about making the communities "fight" for more interaction.
- **Monetization (Streaming):** Receives donations and subscriptions through Twitch and YouTube, which support his streaming activities. No direct funding model for the game development itself is explicitly discussed beyond this.
- **Patreon:** Mentioned in the context of a viewer asking about one-time donations, indicating it's a platform Kaze uses, though details of its use for project funding are not elaborated.

## Key Quotes
- "Every surface has a type that is a bunch of different flags on what should be active on and currently we are working on oily boily bay." (Highlights technical depth and current focus)
- "The idea for the Board the Platforms is gonna be like, you spawn here, and then you're gonna be going around. We do need to get the art style right first." (Shows the blend of gameplay concept and aesthetic importance)
- "I'm making it myself, so I thought I could explain this." (Emphasizes his hands-on approach and willingness to share the process)
- "Dude, the comments on this video are so insanely positive. And this video is doing super well. I think people are sending this to their friends and be like, holy shit, look at this N64 game." (Acknowledges positive reception and the impact of his work)
