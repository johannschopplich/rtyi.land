## Game Development Process
- **Current Focus (Pyramid Level):** Kaze has finished the layout for a "pyramid thing" (a desert pyramid level, part of a larger cardboard-themed stage) and is moving on to texturing. This level is undergoing significant iteration, with an initial design being scrapped in favor of a new concept involving a central room with multiple exits and instant warps.
- **Overall Progress:** The game "Return to Yoshi's Island" is reportedly in its later stages, with Kaze mentioning, "can you believe we're like on the last two courses it's crazy."
- **Projected Timeline:** Main content completion is anticipated for 2025, to be followed by beta testing and bug fixing. Kaze states, "2025, we're probably going to finish all the main content in 2025, but there's still beta left. Testing and bug fixing to be done keep in mind this is like quest 14 so like the main I mean I do have had people test individual levels but the official playlist has not started yet."
- **Engine and Tools:** Kaze is using his own engine, "Kanki," and Blender with a script called "Fast64" to export assets to N64 formats.
- **Development Philosophy:** The process is highly iterative, involving testing, player feedback (from stream chat), and willingness to discard and rework significant portions of levels.

## Personal Insights
- **On Design Complexity:** Kaze acknowledges some designs are "dangerous" or potentially confusing for players initially: "I Don't think this is a bad design. I think it's like confusing at first And it might be something that the players won't understand at first But it's like you go through it once and I think then you will understand it." He later revises the pyramid design to be more manageable.
- **Desire for Innovation:** He expresses a desire to create novel experiences: "I wanted to try something new," when discussing moving away from a more common central room design.
- **Self-Awareness of Development Risks:** Kaze is aware of the potential for Nintendo to take down the game, referring to it as a "calculated risk."
- **Player Experience as a Priority:** He frequently considers how players will perceive and navigate levels, particularly concerning difficulty, confusion, and camera angles. "The one thing I'm actually most worried about in this area is the camera."
- **On Free vs. Paid Games:** "the fact that this game doesn't cost money in a way that's really bad news for us if you have a paid video game you have an investment... if the first level is not good you're not invested right."

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub (Composer):** No relevant information found in this transcript.
- **Biobak (Graphics Artist):**
    - Involved in refining visual elements. Kaze mentions a model: "I know it looks poofy right now but Biobak said it's gonna move it so I'm not worrying about it for now."
    - Biobak also seems to interact in chat, with Kaze acknowledging one of his ideas: "you had the same idea by a mic nice nice nice." (Kaze often refers to Biobak as "biomic" or "Biobak" seemingly interchangeably).
- **Zeina (Animations):** Zeina is mentioned multiple times in personal anecdotes by Kaze (e.g., regarding a broken pitcher, Halloween, living situation). However, her specific contributions to "Return to Yoshi's Island" as an animator are not detailed in this transcript.
- **Other Contributors:**
    - **UD:** Mentioned for ripping models from "Glava" that were then used in Mario 64: "I ripped some models or UD ripped some models from Glava and we put them into Mario 64 though."

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Pyramid Level Redesign:**
    - **Initial Concept:** A maze-like structure where "everything connects back to the main path." This was playtested but Kaze was unsure about it ("not sure if I like it or hate it"). Concerns included players getting lost and needing to repeat the entire maze if they missed collectibles.
    - **Challenge:** "you might go through the entire maze without collecting all eight coins, right that's actually the most likely outcome and Then you need to do it again, basically." Also, difficulty in easily returning to the top.
    - **Revised Concept (influenced by chat):** A central room with two stories and multiple exits (initially four, possibly more), with some paths being one-way and others in-and-out, incorporating "instant warps" to navigate. "One central room with two stories and for four exits And then every exit is a red coin or maybe more than four."
- **Camera Issues:** A significant and recurring challenge, especially in enclosed or complex geometric spaces. "The one thing I'm actually most worried about in this area is the camera... The only issue I have with here is that the camera a lot of the time is poopy So that's something I really need to look out for."
- **Player Navigation and Accessibility:** Designing intuitive paths and clear objectives within complex levels. For example, ensuring players can easily get back to key areas or understand the flow of interconnected tunnels.
- **Staircase Design:** Fine-tuning whether stairs can be walked up or require jumping to balance challenge and player frustration.
- **Collectible Placement:** Strategic placement of items like Yoshi coins and red coins to guide players and ensure exploration.

## Business Aspects
- **Nintendo Takedown Risk:** Kaze is highly aware of the possibility of Nintendo issuing a takedown notice for the ROM hack. He discusses it openly: "how long do you think this game will be up before nintendo takes it down... I don't know if Nintendo really would want to kill me though that for me honestly that that's like a toss-up still."
- **Release Strategy Considerations:** To potentially mitigate immediate takedown, he considers releasing a "copyright free trailer" alongside or shortly after the game's upload, a tactic used previously.
- **Monetization (or lack thereof):** The game will be free. Kaze notes this impacts player investment: "the fact that this game doesn't cost money in a way that's really bad news for us... if the first level is not good you're not invested right."
- **No Direct Funding Mentioned:** The transcript does not contain information about funding sources for the project.

## Key Quotes
- "So I finished a layout for the whole pyramid thing and now we're moving on to texturing... I Did run through this before to test the gameplay and I'm not sure if I like it or hate it It's kind of interesting It does feel maze like but because everything connects back to the main path it's like not that bad." (Illustrates iterative design and initial uncertainty)
- "Sucks I did all this but most of this is reusable. So it's fine. It's fine. It's fine." (On discarding a significant amount of work for the pyramid level, showing resilience and pragmatism)
- "I want the player to easily be able to get back up here and not have to go the entire way up the pyramid again So if there was a place here that caught you and put you back up that would be perfect." (Highlights focus on player experience and addressing design flaws)
- "it still sucks it was a calculated risk I still wanted to do it" (Regarding the potential Nintendo takedown and his determination to create the game)
