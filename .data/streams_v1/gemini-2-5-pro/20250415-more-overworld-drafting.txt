## Game Development Process
-   Currently in the "overworld drafting" phase, focusing on designing events and secret stars.
-   Significant effort recently dedicated to "fixing up Mario 64's audio engine," which Kaze describes as a major refactoring task.
-   The "first draft of all levels is done."
-   Remaining major tasks before release include: finishing the overworld, completing the sound engine refactor, refactoring the operating system, conducting beta tests for every level, incorporating beta testing feedback, waiting for Biobak to finish level reworks, creating side levels, and a "big round of bug fixes."
-   The game is planned to have around 180 stars, with potential to increase to 200. Currently, 177 stars are planned.
-   Kaze is tracking down a bug that only appears after the N64 has been running for six and a half days.

## Personal Insights
-   Kaze expresses strong negative opinions about the original Mario 64 audio engine, calling it "fucked" and "dogshit," believing it was poorly written and overly redundant.
-   He believes that simply adding many cool mechanics does not necessarily result in a good game: "I Know it is tempting to look at the game you're making and to be like Let's throw in every cool mechanic that I know of But I don't think that gets you a good game."
-   He acknowledges the challenges and frustrations of development, describing the audio code refactoring as something that's "gonna drive me insane."
-   Kaze is aware of potential backlash from the Nintendo community for criticizing Mario 64: "If I make a video called the Mario 64 audio system is fucked, people will fucking kill me."
-   He finds some YouTube comments annoying: "Dude the comments under my newest video have been so annoying God I need to strangle someone."

## Collaborator Information
-   **Badub (Badoob):**
    -   The composer for the "Return to Yoshi's Island" OST.
    -   Has created "almost 20 songs for the overworld" ("RTYI overworld pack") designed to transition seamlessly into each other.
    -   Has also created "a shit ton of sound effects" for the overworld (e.g., rain, seagulls, jungle, creature, ocean waves).
    -   Kaze listens to Badoob's compositions during the stream to see if they fit the overworld.
-   **Biobak (Biobak):**
    -   A graphics artist involved in "level reworks." The team is waiting for Biobak to finish these.
    -   Kaze discusses ideas with Biobak, for example, for a "conspiracy Yoshi house level" which Biobak had apparently made.
    -   Mentioned in the context of a potential "bonus level" (Bowser's yacht).
-   **Zeina (Zayna):**
    -   Works on animations and detailed level work.
    -   "One area in Course 13 missing because Zeyna wanted to work on it. And she has been putting a lot of detail on there."
-   **Other Contributors:**
    -   **Death Wizard:** Mentioned for creating a bug sheet detailing issues with the Mario 64 audio engine across different game versions (JP, US, PAL, Shindou).
    -   **Okayo:** Kaze's video editor. Mentioned in the context of making YouTube content creation easier.
    -   **Squarespace:** A sponsor for Kaze's YouTube videos, indirectly supporting the project's funding.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
-   **Overworld Design:**
    -   Focus on creating numerous events and secret stars to make the overworld feel alive.
    -   Aiming for approximately 50,000 polygons for the overworld.
    -   Music will fade into each other seamlessly when moving between areas.
    -   Overworld events are intended to have permanent effects (e.g., Yoshi farmer planting a Piranha Plant after Shy Guys attack).
-   **Star Count:** Debating between 180 (current plan) and 200 stars for the final game, with Kaze noting it's easy to add more lower-quality secret stars.
-   **Audio System:**
    -   Using a mix of streamed music (sounds better, performs better, but large file size) and sequenced music for the game's ~120 songs.
    -   Major undertaking to refactor the original Mario 64 audio engine due to its perceived flaws and inefficiencies (e.g., "float multiplication with a value close to one on every single node... every single audio tick").
-   **Day/Night Cycle:** Considered for the overworld but rejected due to the difficulty of implementing it well (dynamically changing vertex colors) and lack of clear purpose, despite acknowledging its coolness in games like Majora's Mask.
-   **Character Reappearance & Development:** Characters from levels may reappear in the overworld with new dialogues or roles after level completion (e.g., Boshi having a character arc).
-   **Feature Creep:** Kaze is wary of adding features just because they are cool, preferring a focused design.
-   **Technical Limitations:** Working within N64 constraints, dealing with bugs like one that takes 6.5 days to manifest.
-   **Player Guidance:** Designing intuitive ways for players to find secrets or progress (e.g., the Elder Yoshi in the dojo providing hints).
-   **Item-Carrying Missions:** Generally avoided as Kaze believes "carrying items just isn't fun."

## Business Aspects
-   **Funding:** The project is supported through Kaze's YouTube content, which includes sponsorships (e.g., Squarespace) and allows him to "pay the people that help me."
-   **Marketing/Distribution:** The game will be distributed as a patch. Kaze's YouTube videos about the development also serve as a form of marketing.
-   **Nintendo Takedown Contingency:**
    -   Kaze is aware of the risk of Nintendo issuing a cease and desist.
    -   His stated plan if this happens: "I will remove Mario from the game. And the Goombas. And the Yoshis. And I will make them my own characters. And then instead of a romhack, I will release a video game."
    -   He jokingly (and perhaps half-seriously) considers the PR and financial potential of a legal battle with Nintendo, referencing Epic Games vs. Apple.
    -   He notes that out of over a hundred projects, only one game (The Missing Link, not a Mario hack) and some videos were taken down, and videos he fought for were reinstated.

## Key Quotes

-   "our mission is to come up with more events and secret stars for the overworld... I'm thinking maybe we just say fuck it and put 40 secret stars in your world." (Illustrates the brainstorming and scope definition for the overworld)
-   "I Know it is tempting to look at the game you're making and to be like Let's throw in every cool mechanic that I know of But I don't think that gets you a good game." (Kaze's game design philosophy)
-   "In a Season Assist [Cease and Desist], what will you do? I will remove Mario from the game. And the Goombas. And the Yoshis. And I will make them my own characters. And then instead of a romhack, I will release a video game." (Contingency plan for Nintendo action)
