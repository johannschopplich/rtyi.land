## Game Development Process
- The game "Return to Yoshi's Island" (RTYI) is in a late stage of development, with the overworld design being a primary focus.
- Main courses (15 of them) are largely complete, though some are awaiting visual reworks by collaborator Biobak.
- Side levels are among the remaining tasks.
- The overworld is designed as one huge, seamless map.
- Kaze employs an iterative design process, especially for the overworld, where major layout changes occur before visual finalization ("And this is why we don't finish any visuals yet. It's because I make changes like this and that would ruin everything.").
- The game runs at 60 FPS on actual N64 hardware, with options like widescreen support.
- A key milestone is completing the "first draft of the overworld," with a goal to finish it within the next week or two from the stream's date.

## Personal Insights
- Kaze aims to create a game world that feels "alive" and "always-changing" through features like overworld events.
- He enjoys designing elements that "tease" the player, like a visible but initially inaccessible star ("I like the idea of there being a star visible the whole time you play the game, and you have no idea how to get to it.").
- He has strong opinions on game design, such as the utility of in-game currency ("we definitely need to add things that you can buy, otherwise you're gonna go your whole life collecting coins not knowing what they're for") and the nature of "chaos" hacks.
- He reflects on the expense of video editing for his YouTube channel, which supports his work indirectly.
- He expresses a desire for permanence in game changes resulting from player actions ("events need to be something you beat and then they give you a star. And then that permanently changes the overworld in some way.").

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub:** The composer for the game. He is currently "working with music a little bit trying to figure out what would work for the overworld."
- **Biobak:** A graphics artist responsible for significant visual reworks of levels. Kaze mentions levels looking "a lot better now" after Biobak's rework and that some levels are "still awaiting Biomech's rework." Biobak's work influences Kaze's timing for creating collision maps. Kaze also notes that Biobak "can change the collision while reworking but i don't think he does and it's not recommended he does."
- **Zeina:** Mentioned for cutting Kaze's hair. Kaze also looks for concept art possibly made by "Xena" (likely Zeina) for a gondola component, suggesting she contributes to art/design.
- **Other Contributors:**
    - **Aza:** Working on a side level dedicated to "crazy daisies."
    - **Lincoln:** Drew a thumbnail for one of Kaze's videos.
    - **Alok:** Mentioned as someone who might port a feature ("Minx") related to development.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Wing Cap Level Entrance:** A major design challenge is how players will access the Wing Cap level.
    - The initial idea of using a Cloud Cap was rejected because "the cloud cap is break all the visuals it's gonna make it so you can see all the magic happening and i i hate that." It would require too many restrictions on level modeling.
    - Alternative solutions brainstormed include: an overworld event (e.g., pirates attacking, then a sunken ship appears), a purchasable entrance, climbing a tree and bouncing, a chukster, or a "baby Yoshi crypt" in the Yoshi room shrinking the player.
    - The chosen solution involves the Yoshi room having a "baby Yoshi crypt" that warps the player, with the associated Yoshi Coin being obtainable via balloons blown by a Toad or held by Seals during different game "Acts."
- **Overworld Connectivity & Immersion:**
    - Strong emphasis on making the overworld seamless ("the entire overworld is going to be one huge map that's going to be seamless").
    - Ensuring thematic and physical connections between levels (e.g., Wing Cap level being above Koopa Wave Cove).
    - Avoiding designs that allow players to see "behind the curtain" or break immersion.
- **Coin Utility:** A conscious effort to make coins valuable by adding shops and purchasable items/access (e.g., paying 200 coins to a Bob-omb to use a cannon).
- **Overworld Events:** Designed to make Yoshi's Island feel dynamic and alive. These events are one-time occurrences that permanently change the overworld and reward a star.
- **Bowser Fight Arena:** Designing an area in the overworld that serves as a late-game Bowser fight arena without looking obviously like one early on. The solution involves an "apple tree garden" (or "melon garden") that becomes wilted and whose trees are destroyed during the fight, with thorn bushes appearing to block exits.
- **Player Overwhelm:** Concern about unlocking too many areas at once after a major story point, potentially causing "choice paralysis." This leads to considering ways to gate access to some later parts.

## Business Aspects
- Kaze finances his YouTube video editing through "sponsor deals."
- He plans to make a "video essay" about RTYI upon its release, suggesting a marketing/promotional strategy.
- There's an underlying awareness and concern about potential legal repercussions from Nintendo for creating a fan game ("Nintendo might just murder me.").
- No direct funding for RTYI itself is mentioned, but the YouTube channel which promotes it is supported by sponsorships.

## Key Quotes
- "The idea is that these [overworld events] really make Yoshi's Island feel alive, and like it's an always-changing island with things always going on."
- "having the cloudcap in the overworld is going to be awkward because what if you just go to a previous part and then you know break the world geometry and look over the walls and see nothing so i don't like that."
- "It's almost finished. What even left to do other than the overworld? Just some side levels. But yeah, the overworld is pretty much the last part."
- "I like the idea of there being a star visible the whole time you play the game, and you have no idea how to get to it. And then later you unlock it somehow. Yep, that looks great. That's such a tease."
