## Game Development Process
- **Overall Progress Tracker:** Kaze has created and shared a public RTYI Progress Tracker (a spreadsheet) to show the completion percentage of each course and other game elements. He notes that most courses are between 75% and 100% complete, though reworks are still possible.
- **Beta Testing:** The game is in a beta testing phase. Course 4 has just undergone its first beta test, which revealed a "very frustrating bug" causing softlocks and issues with a "plane mission." This feedback is now driving the next stage of development for that course.
- **Iterative Reworks:** Levels are not considered "final" even when playable. Kaze mentions that his collaborator, Biobak, may decide to rework courses that Kaze currently considers finished, highlighting an iterative and collaborative refinement process.
- **Tool-Related Delays:** Progress is sometimes hindered by bugs in external tools, specifically "Fast64." A lighting bug ("not yellow and red anymore") persists, and Kaze is waiting on the tool's developers for a fix, as he cannot solve it himself.

## Personal Insights
- **Art vs. Commerce:** Kaze expresses a clear conflict between his passion for game development and the financial necessity of creating YouTube content. He states he hates making videos but does it because "it's good money," which funds his ability to work on passion projects like RTYI.
- **Game Design Philosophy:** Kaze is critical of games he perceives as "just chores" (citing *Bully* and *Harvest Moon*). He believes games should be a "series of interesting choices" and values creative expression and player agency over repetitive tasks.
- **Views on Modern Gaming:** He is skeptical of the need for constant hardware upgrades, arguing that "console software was good enough ten years ago." He believes focusing on a single hardware generation would lead to "better games... cheaper games... [and] more games," and that art style should be a deliberate choice, not just a chase for realism.

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub:** Mentioned as the source for some of the new sound effects being implemented in the game, made possible by a completely remade sound engine.
- **Biobak:** (Also referred to as "Vileback" and "Biobak" in chat). A key collaborator responsible for graphics and level reworks. Kaze states that 90% of Biobak's work is updating graphics, but he also makes simple gameplay changes. Kaze is waiting for Biobak to get his "hands on this" level to make it look "a lot better." They have known each other for about 10 years.
- **Zeina:** No relevant information found.
- **Other Contributors:**
    - **Lyska:** Mentioned in relation to "the good PC port" (referred to as "recombination"). Kaze communicates with her about the project and community feedback.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Atmosphere and Sound Design:** Kaze is adding new ambient sounds (propellers, windmills) to make the world feel "so much more alive." The game's main theme has also been incorporated into the new overworld song.
- **Level Art and Blending:** A significant portion of the stream is dedicated to finding the right aesthetic for a volcanic island. This involves selecting appropriate rock textures, creating visual consistency, and using transparent decals to blend different ground types (e.g., grass to dirt) smoothly.
- **Gameplay Mission Rework:** The "plane mission" in Course 4 was poorly received in beta testing ("the plane mission sucks"). Kaze and Biobak have already discussed it and have a "decent idea to damage control it," indicating a willingness to scrap or overhaul core gameplay mechanics based on feedback.
- **Player Guidance and Level Boundaries:** Kaze debates making the tops of cliffs grassy. He decides against it initially because "it's going to look reachable," showing a careful consideration for how environmental design guides the player and manages expectations.

## Business Aspects
- **Monetization Strategy:** Kaze's primary income stream appears to be his YouTube channel. He feels his bi-weekly video upload schedule, while consisting of content he sometimes perceives as "nonsense," is what "does well on YouTube" and provides the "good money" needed to survive and fund his game development.
- **Release Strategy:** There is no set release date. Kaze is audibly frustrated by the question and has created the progress tracker to manage community expectations. The official stance is, "It's going to release when it's done."
- **Intellectual Property and Piracy:** Kaze is aware of a bootleg industry that sells his ROM hacks on cartridges, estimating they have made over a million dollars from his work. He actively avoids making his games easily flashable to physical cartridges because he is "a little scared that Nintendo is going to murder me for that."

## Key Quotes
- **On Balancing Passion and Work:** "Yeah, unfortunately I am a real human in the real world and I do need to collect money to survive. I know it sucks. I wish I could just say fuck it and only work on my hacks too."
- **On Development Philosophy:** "You guys should not see inefficient development practices as like, man, they didn't optimize it. This game sucks. You should see it as like, okay, they cut a lot of corners to produce this game cheaper."
- **On Managing Community Expectations:** "I mean, I get like from an individual perspective. It's like a very innocent thing to ask for a release date... But with like the mass of people asking that question, it is extremely annoying."

## Potential Interview Topics
1.  **The Creator's Dilemma:** Explore the tension between creating content for an algorithm (YouTube videos) and pursuing a personal passion project (RTYI). How does he balance the time, energy, and creative mindset required for both?
2.  **The Collaborative Process:** Delve into the working relationship with Biobak. How are creative decisions made when one person handles the core design and another handles the graphical polish? How are disagreements resolved, and can you provide an example of how Biobak's input significantly changed a level?
3.  **Designing for an N64 Feel:** Kaze has strong opinions on N64-era design. How does this philosophy specifically manifest in "Return to Yoshi's Island"? What modern conventions does he intentionally avoid, and what "stupid bullshit" from the original Mario 64 has he been happy to leave behind?
4.  **Community as a Double-Edged Sword:** Discuss the role of the community in development. How has live feedback from streams and beta tests shaped the game, and how does he manage the pressure and repetitive questions (like release dates) that come with a public-facing development process?
5.  **Navigating the ROM Hacking Scene:** Ask about the legal and ethical gray areas of ROM hacking. How does the threat of Nintendo's legal action and the reality of third-party bootleggers profiting from his work affect his design choices and distribution plans?
