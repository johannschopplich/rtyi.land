## Game Development Process
- Course 1 is considered complete after recent reworks.
- Actively working on Course 14, including designing new missions, assets, and music integration.
- Hub world development is planned for the very end of the project.
- Course 15 is already partially developed with existing assets.
- The development process is iterative, with Kaze frequently revisiting and reworking levels and features (e.g., Course 1, bridge texture in "bunny brush woods," paper airplane mission in Course 14).
- Performance optimization is an ongoing concern, especially for visually complex levels like Course 14, involving techniques like culling and addressing overdraw.
- Kaze often works on features off-stream (e.g., googly eyes on enemies) and then showcases or discusses them.
- Real hardware testing (N64) is part of the process to check frame rates and visual fidelity.

## Personal Insights
- Kaze describes himself as a "7 out of 10" designer and acknowledges that his initial ideas aren't always the best, emphasizing an iterative approach.
- He strongly prefers reworking levels to achieve higher quality, even if it means more effort, rather than leaving "the worst level" in the game.
- Kaze values player freedom and immersion, aiming to create experiences that allow players to "experience freedom and immersion."
- He expresses strong opinions on game design, art style, and even critiques other game developers (e.g., Game Freak).
- He shows a self-aware sense of humor regarding his own process and potential external perceptions (e.g., Nintendo takedowns).
- He believes contrast in gameplay (e.g., restricted movement followed by Wing Cap freedom) amplifies positive feelings for the player.

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub:** Composer for the game. Created "so many new songs" for Course 14, with dynamic music where instruments fade in and out depending on the player's location within different "biomes" of the level. Kaze communicates with him via messages.
- **Biobak:** Graphics artist and level designer. Contributed the idea for paper fortune teller enemies ("Chubby Chai guys" as thimbles). Known for reworking levels and improving performance despite adding more content. Kaze also mentions Biobak's font.
- **Zeina(b):** Animator. Tasked with creating a new icon for Mario (presumably the player icon or a HUD element), as the current one is temporary. Also made changes to Mario's crouch animation.
- **Other Contributors:**
    - **"a big":** Created textures for the new font implemented in the game.
    - **Lera:** 3D modeler. Contributed models for the game, including a target holder (designed to look plant-like). Offered to make a paper airplane model and received feedback on its design from Kaze.
    - **Stream Chat:** Kaze actively engages with his chat, sometimes incorporating their suggestions (e.g., "ball push pins" from Yoshi's Island for marking spots, confetti for cannons).

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Art Style & Asset Design:** Significant time spent discussing and iterating on the bridge texture in "bunny brush woods" to make it fit the level's aesthetic. Similar detailed attention was given to creating an accurate 3D model of a folded paper airplane, including UV mapping.
- **Mission Design (Course 14):**
    - Original "Paper Airplane" star mission (collect 5 silver stars mid-flight) was critiqued by Kaze as feeling "pointless" and "stiff."
    - Proposed solution: Introduce a Wing Cap or Cloud Cap in Act 6, allowing free flight over the entire level, transforming the play experience. The paper airplane might be repurposed for a simpler task.
    - Designing challenges for the Wing Cap: Considering a "sign hunt" leading to different spots, using "X" marks on the ground, or timed challenges.
    - A key challenge is ensuring Wing Cap-exclusive areas don't become overly frustrating if the player falls and has to restart a long sequence. Cannons are considered as a way to regain height/momentum.
    - New idea: Using shootable targets (potentially held by "bubble blower" like structures that rip when flown through) instead of silver stars for a Wing Cap mission.
- **Enemy Design:** Adding googly eyes to enemies that look at the player. Biobak's idea for "Chubby Chai guys" (thimbles) as paper fortune teller enemies that spawn and attack.
- **Camera System:** Kaze encountered and debugged issues with the flying camera, particularly its auto-rotation and tilt behavior.
- **N64 Limitations:** Working within the constraints of N64 hardware, such as rules for animated skeletons (bones must point up, no roll, hierarchical attachment). Texture size and color depth limitations (e.g., 16x16 intensity alpha 8).

## Business Aspects
- No relevant information found. The stream focuses entirely on the creative and technical aspects of development.

## Key Quotes
- "I know people sometimes give me shit for putting reworks of my level in, but would you rather just have the worst level? I think I much prefer this, to be honest." (Reflects Kaze's commitment to quality and iterative design).
- "I also love the contrast this gives you between normal gameplay and gameplay with the wing cap, because contrast is really what amplifies your feeling and by having a strong contrast between non-free and free parts, the freedom is going to feel more freedom, you know what I mean?" (Explains his design philosophy for the Wing Cap feature in Course 14).
- "It's not just my game, you are helping a lot on it. It's just the the other texture just doesn't fit in the architecture, if you ask me." (Acknowledges community/collaborator contributions while asserting his design vision).

## Potential Interview Topics
1.  **The Iterative Design Philosophy:** Explore Kaze's approach to reworking levels (like Course 1 and the bridge in Course 14). Why is this iterative process crucial for "Return to Yoshi's Island," and how does he decide when a rework is necessary versus "good enough"?
2.  **Collaborative Dynamics:** Discuss how Kaze manages and integrates contributions from various artists (Badub, Biobak, Zeina, Lera, "a big"). How are creative differences handled, and how does collaboration shape the game's direction?
3.  **Designing for "Freedom" within Constraints:** The Wing Cap concept for Course 14 aims to provide a feeling of freedom. Delve into how Kaze balances this design goal with the technical limitations of the N64 platform and the need for structured gameplay challenges.
4.  **Evolution of a Level (Course 14):** Using Course 14 as an example, trace the evolution of its design, from initial concepts for stars/missions, through critiques (like the paper airplane), to the development of new mechanics (Wing Cap, target shooting).
5.  **Community Influence on Development:** Kaze often interacts with his stream chat. How has this live feedback loop and the incorporation of community ideas (like Biobak's fortune teller enemies or chat suggestions) impacted the development of "Return to Yoshi's Island"?
