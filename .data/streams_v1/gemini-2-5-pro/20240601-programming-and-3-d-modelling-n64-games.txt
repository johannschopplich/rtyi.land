## Game Development Process
- The stream focuses on the level design of an "Ice Castle" for "Return to Yoshi's Island."
- Current stage involves "grey-boxing" or "blocking out" the level, prioritizing platforming mechanics, level flow, and connections between areas before detailed visual work. Kaze states: "Our task for the day is to make the platforming good. And then after we made the platforming good. We can make the visuals good."
- Iterative development is evident: Kaze builds sections, tests them, identifies issues (e.g., camera, jump difficulty, layout dead-ends), and refines them live.
- Progress includes defining objectives (star locations) and ensuring the overall structure of the castle level functions as intended (e.g., "recap all the stars real quick and see if we have a decent layout now").
- Specific mechanics being implemented and tested include slide jumps, momentum jumps, snowball puzzles, and a "mirror Mario" wall-kick concept inspired by chat.
- Consideration of N64 hardware limitations is constant, particularly regarding rendering complexity (e.g., "I don't want to render that many Mario's") and memory ("stay within the 64 megabytes limit").
- Plans to import "Sauron's Trace," a performance analysis tool, to help optimize the game.

## Personal Insights
- Kaze emphasizes designing for a specific "feeling": "I think making a game is all about designing a feeling that you want the player to have." This guides his acceptance or rejection of design ideas.
- He aims for a difficulty level comparable to vanilla Mario 64 but with more consistent controls: "Difficulty probably around vanilla Mario 64... But the controls in this game are a lot more consistent."
- His philosophy on difficulty includes player agency: "the game is as difficult as you make it... the game is as difficult as you are brave."
- Kaze expresses a preference for simple and effective programming: "Programming is something you do to build something. The act of it itself should be as simple as possible."
- He has a clear stance on source code release: "I released the source code whenever my mods done because if I release it before then I dig my whole mod so I don't want that." This is to ensure the mod is experienced as a complete product.
- He discusses his work process, including how streaming can help with focus, despite the dual task of working and engaging chat.

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub (composer):** No relevant information found in this transcript.
- **Biobak (graphics artist):** Referred to as "Biobak" in chat and "Biobak" when Kaze considers his graphical idea. Biobak/Biobak suggested a texture/effect for bottomless pits: "Let's give Biobak's idea and try here..."
- **Zeina (animations):** Greeted in chat ("Hello Zaina"), but no specific contributions to "Return to Yoshi's Island" are detailed in this transcript.
- **Other Contributors:**
    - **Dan:** Mentioned as someone Kaze talked to about materials/shaders: "I was playing with materials a little bit more after talking to Dan."
    - **Eiza:** Collaborated with Kaze on past projects ("Royal Skyrim game," "Scuttlebug hack"), where Eiza handled much of his own art/models, and Kaze did programming, shaders, and slides. Eiza's models were used in the "Scuttlebug" hack.
    - **Sauron:** Developed a performance tracing tool ("Sauron's Trace") that Kaze plans to integrate.
    - **Easy As Pie:** Created the N64 GCC (compiler) fork that Kaze uses.
    - **Lila (chat mod):** Shared a video about a neural network running on N64, sparking a discussion.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Camera Issues:** A recurring challenge is camera behavior, especially in tight indoor spaces or during complex platforming. "Which the camera here still sucks. But I'm going to fix that."
- **Level Layout and Flow:** Significant time is spent ensuring areas connect logically, players can navigate intuitively, and dead-ends or overly frustrating sections are addressed. This includes adding ways back to main areas and adjusting geometry when "running out of level... physical space."
- **Visuals vs. Performance:** Balancing desired visual effects (e.g., ice materials, mirror reflections, special pit textures) with N64 capabilities. Kaze experiments with effects but is mindful of performance ("I don't want to render that many Mario's").
- **Thematic Consistency:** Decisions are made to align with the "Ice Castle" theme, such as changing proposed jail cells to "frozen walls and there's people behind the frozen walls" based on chat feedback.
- **Mechanic Integration:** Exploring how different mechanics (slides, momentum jumps, wind effects, potential "mirror Mario") can be combined and used effectively within the level.
- **Player Guidance and Difficulty:** Adjusting "leap of faith" jumps to be less punishing, and ensuring difficulty stems from skill rather than obscure design. The goal is "vanilla Mario 64" difficulty but with more reliable controls.
- **Iterative Problem Solving:** When a section is not working ("Okay, that jump is entirely impossible. That jump is just never going to happen. I guess you can do that. Yeah, this section sucks."), Kaze immediately works on redesigning or tweaking it.

## Business Aspects
- **Source Code Release Strategy:** Kaze plans to release the source code for "Return to Yoshi's Island" only after the mod is completed to maintain the integrity of the project and how it's first experienced.
- **Monetization of Past Projects/Channel:** Kaze mentions selling a physical cartridge of a previous fan project ("Valuigi's Tango Stand cartridge, which netted me $600") and views tools like the RetroBlaster as an "investment" for his YouTube channel, which is his primary platform for showcasing work.
- **Professional Work:** Kaze mentions he is "actually already working in Unreal Engine 5 for a different company," indicating separate professional game development activities.
- No direct marketing, specific funding, or distribution plans for "Return to Yoshi's Island" itself are discussed in this transcript beyond the eventual source code release.
