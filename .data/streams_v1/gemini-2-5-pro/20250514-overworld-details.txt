## Game Development Process
- The project is in a mature stage, with a focus on refining specific levels, polishing visuals, and fixing bugs based on user feedback.
- A significant milestone, "beta test 1 of course 4" (the zoo level), has been completed. Feedback from this test is actively being used to improve the level, such as reworking a "plane mission."
- The development process involves moving from basic, flat geometry ("grey-boxing") to detailed environmental art passes, adding shaders, textures, and complex models like new bridges and forests.
- The game's scope is substantial, noted by the fact it has approximately 480 dialogue boxes, which is about three times the amount in the original Super Mario 64.

## Personal Insights
- Kaze prioritizes player enjoyment and emergent fun over strict, utilitarian design. He believes some of the best design elements can be things that exist "just because fun" without a specific reward.
- He holds a player-centric view, believing that game lore and complex backstories should not interrupt the gameplay experience, as the player's primary interest is in playing the game, not reading lore.
- Kaze has strong, pragmatic opinions on development, such as his belief that the choice of programming language is less important than a programmer's actual skill.
- He shows a willingness to experiment and even implement features he's unsure about, using in-game testing to validate or discard ideas (e.g., the coins flying at the player).

## Collaborator Information
- **Badoop (Badoop):** The project's sound composer. Kaze has built a custom tool for Badoop to create sound effects directly for the game, indicating a close and tool-driven collaboration.
- **Biobak (Biomech):** A key contributor of ideas and potentially graphics. Kaze directly credits him with the "Trophy Building" idea and agrees to implement it, showing an open and collaborative design process. Biobak also gives feedback on Kaze's work during the stream.
- **Zeina (Zayna):** A texture artist for the project. Kaze uses her textures and mentions the possibility of requesting higher-resolution source files from her for better quality.
- **Other Contributors:**
    - **Okayo:** A long-term collaborator who seems invested in the public-facing success of the project's content.
    - **Kyle:** Collaborates on creating supplementary YouTube videos, such as one titled "Why was the N64 so blurry?"
    - **Lila:** A prominent member of the community/team, frequently addressed during the stream. Kaze jokingly delegates bug fixing to her, suggesting she may be involved in bug tracking or management.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Level Objective Rework:** A key decision was made to change a level's objective from a time limit to a damage-avoidance challenge. This was done to make the section "a lot more fun" based on an assessment of the previous design.
- **Visual Cohesion:** A major challenge highlighted is blending 2D background elements with 3D foreground models to create a convincing environment (specifically, the forest). Kaze struggles with texture resolution, color matching, and avoiding a "flat" look.
- **Player Guidance vs. Player Skill:** Kaze grapples with design ambiguity. He mentions a beta tester repeatedly running into unseen glass and dying, and he debates whether this is a design flaw that needs to be fixed or a fair "skill issue" for the player to overcome.
- **Technical Problem-Solving:** A recurring challenge is working within the N64's technical constraints (or the decompilation's recreation of them), such as dealing with rendering bugs, texture limitations, and performance issues like "triple overdraw fuckery." Kaze also battles with the quirks of his software tools (Blender, GIMP, Photoshop).

## Business Aspects
- **Sponsorship-Driven Content:** Kaze explicitly states that his ability to produce regular video content (which includes development streams) is tied to sponsorship deals, specifically mentioning Squarespace.
- **Influencer Marketing:** He is aware of his position as an influencer in the retro gaming community. He discusses the expectation of receiving review units of new hardware (like an N64 FPGA) from companies for free in exchange for creating content about them.
- **Video Promotion:** There is a clear focus on the YouTube performance of their content. Kaze celebrates a video reaching 800,000 views, a long-term goal for his collaborator Okayo.

## Key Quotes
- "peak game design is this guy i throw you maybe you hit the star there's no reason for this to exist it's just there because fun and you know people are gonna try this"
- "the level overall seems decent except the bugs sucked and the plane mission sucked so i think we can make a good game out of quest 4 which surprised me i thought quest 4 was kind of bad"
- "Just because you as the game designer cares about the lore, doesn't mean that the player is going to care... you don't want to interrupt the player to tell them a lore that they might not care about, right?"

## Potential Interview Topics
- **The Collaborative Ecosystem:** Explore the dynamics of working with a distributed team (Badoop, Biobak, Zayna). How are ideas pitched, integrated, and credited? How have the tools you've built for them changed the workflow?
- **Philosophy of "Fun":** Delve into the design principle of including elements "just because fun." How do you identify these opportunities, and how do you balance them against more structured, goal-oriented gameplay?
- **Interpreting Player Feedback:** Based on the "invisible glass" dilemma, discuss your process for analyzing player feedback. How do you distinguish between a design flaw that needs fixing and a challenge that is a fair test of a player's skill?
- **The Art of the N64 Aesthetic:** The stream heavily focused on creating a convincing forest. Can you elaborate on the artistic and technical process of blending 2D and 3D elements to create immersive worlds while respecting the N64's unique visual style and limitations?
- **Developer and Content Creator:** Discuss the balance between the creative pursuit of game development and the business realities of being a YouTube content creator who relies on sponsorships and audience engagement to fund the work.
