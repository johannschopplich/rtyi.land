## Game Development Process
- **Overall Progress:** The game "Return to Yoshi's Island" is actively in development. Kaze is working on multiple courses simultaneously.
    - **Course 13:** Mostly done, with Zeina working on finishing touches, particularly the outside area.
    - **Course 14 (Craft Level):** Currently in the asset creation and basic layout phase. Kaze is focusing on producing assets that fit the craft aesthetic (crayons, plastic cups, cardboard elements, etc.).
    - **Course 15:** Platforms are already designed; the next step is to import them and build the level structure.
- **Major Milestones & Stages:**
    - Asset production for new levels (Course 14).
    - Level layout and basic structuring ("make a very basic version of this level. And then we're going to add to it").
    - Iterative development: Ideas are prototyped and refined (e.g., adding a trace outline for a drawing-based star).
    - Future plans include a Bowser level and side levels.
    - A demo of the first course is tentatively planned for release "in the next two months, hopefully."
- **Technical Development:**
    - ROM size limit is set to 64MB.
    - Ongoing engine optimizations, including the recent import of F3DX3.
    - Performance is a key concern, with a target of at least 30 FPS on N64 hardware. Strategies include adjusting asset density (e.g., "reducing the amount of clouds").

## Personal Insights
- **On Sponsorships:** Kaze expresses a general aversion to advertisements and sponsorships unless he can approach them subversively ("fuck them over") or if he believes the product has genuine merit (e.g., Brilliant). He details a humorous, unconventional plan for a potential Raid Shadow Legends sponsored video.
- **On Game Design Philosophy:** Kaze mentions that for past projects like "Last Impact," his primary goal was to implement his ideas and make something "interesting," not necessarily "fun" in the conventional sense. He values not being "lazy" in executing his creative vision.
- **On Learning Game Development:** He advises aspiring developers to "make as many games as possible as fast as possible," acknowledging that early attempts will likely "suck ass," and this is part of the learning process.
- **On Future Goals:** Kaze sees increasing his YouTube presence as a way to generate income and build PR for his future original game projects, which he might release on platforms like Steam, potentially with an N64 version as a promotional tool.
- **On Content Creation:** He enjoys making YouTube videos and plans to produce more, particularly those similar to his successful "The problem with the grass in Mario 64" video, due to their popularity and potential for revenue.

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub:** No specific mention of Badub (composer) or their work in this transcript segment.
- **Biobak (also referred to as Biobak):**
    - A graphics artist expected to polish the visual aspects of levels ("It's probably gonna get a lot better once Biobak gets a sense on this").
    - Currently working on "Quiz 1" (presumably a level or section).
    - Kaze consults with him or considers his input on art direction.
- **Zeina (Zeina):**
    - Works on finishing level areas, specifically mentioned for the "outside area" of Course 13.
    - Handles animations.
    - Conducts playtesting; Kaze mentions she tested physics on a level and "managed to move pretty well."
    - Contributes to level design and potentially sketching ideas (e.g., for the overworld).
- **Other Contributors:**
    - **Sauraen:** Mentioned as working on RSP (Reality Signal Processor) optimization for the game engine, aiming to "come up with a lot of really cool things."
    - **Michi:** Kaze mentions wanting to ask ChatGPT why "Michi's code didn't work," implying a past technical contribution or issue.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Course 14 (Craft Level) Theme:** The level is designed with a "craft materials" aesthetic, featuring elements like crayons, paper cutouts, cardboard, plastic cups, and doodles. This theme is distinct from "Yoshi's Crafted World" but shares a similar vibe.
    - **Star Ideas for Course 14:**
        1.  Helping a Yoshi doodle protect apples from "squirrels" (squid-like craft creatures).
        2.  Reaching a Toad doodle on a mountain.
        3.  Bringing a yellow crayon to a Luigi doodle to draw a star on a piece of paper.
        4.  A platforming section inside a large cardboard box.
        5.  A weasel ball toy guarding a red coin area, leading to an 8-bit pipe to Mario Paint.
- **Asset Creation & Aesthetics:** Significant time is spent conceptualizing and creating assets like plastic cups (with reflective properties), cardboard trees, painted cardboard mountains, and push-pins for platforming. There's a focus on making these assets fit the craft theme and look good within N64 limitations.
- **Gameplay Mechanics:**
    - Interactive drawing for a star (Luigi crayon star).
    - Potential for platforming on push-pins.
    - Idea for a paper airplane Mario can ride.
    - Tilting platforms made of cardboard and toothpicks.
    - Googly eyes with physics for fortress enemies like Thwomps.
- **Challenges & Solutions:**
    - **Clarity of Mechanics:** For the crayon-drawing star, Kaze plans to add a "trace outline" to make the objective clearer.
    - **Performance vs. Visuals:** Balancing the density of elements (e.g., clouds) to maintain FPS on N64.
    - **Asset Design:** Finding the right textures and modeling techniques to achieve the desired "craft" look (e.g., for plastic cups, paper lanterns).
    - **Theme Consistency:** Deciding against including books in the craft level as they "don't really feel like craft material," unless purely for "funny titles."
    - **NPCs in Craft Level:** NPCs in Course 14 will be "very robotic" and "not real people," making a complex story for the course difficult.
- **Level Structure:** Kaze mentions making a basic version of a level first, then adding details. He also discusses ideas for an overworld based on "Yoshi's fruit islands."

## Business Aspects
- **Sponsorships:** Kaze is actively negotiating a sponsorship with Raid Shadow Legends. He has a specific, humorous, and somewhat subversive idea for the sponsored video content, aiming to provide minimal actual promotion for Raid while delivering extensive unrelated content (four hours of "every visible wall in Super Mario 64").
- **Monetization & PR:** He views his YouTube channel and content creation as a key source of income and a public relations tool for his game development work, including future original commercial games.
- **Future Commercial Game:** Kaze states he wouldn't make an N64 game from scratch for financial success, suggesting a Steam release would be more viable, with a potential N64 version serving as an "advertisement."
- **Approach to Ads:** He generally dislikes ads and sponsorships, only taking them if he can control the narrative, subvert expectations, or if he genuinely believes in the product's merit.

## Key Quotes
- "This is the craft level. It's made out of craft materials, the whole thing. I still need a funny crayon brand name. I was thinking Craytendo would be good." (Describing Course 14's theme and early design thoughts)
- "One star I have planned is that there will be a piece of paper on the floor and there will be ice drawn on it. And there will be a doodle of Luigi standing next to the piece of paper. And he will be like, man, if only I had a yellow crayon, I could draw a star... So you bring him a yellow crayon... you draw a star on the paper and you get a star for it." (Detailing an innovative star concept)
- "Generally, I never take sponsorships unless I can think of a way to like fuck them over... So typically I do not take any sponsorships unless it's like, you know, something I actually think has some merit to it." (On his philosophy regarding sponsorships)
- "when i made last impact really my thought was never can i make this fun it was always just i have an idea i'll put it in... my mindset was so much like i don't want to be some lazy dude who doesn't put the things he wanted this game in" (Reflecting on his past development approach)
