## Game Development Process
-   **Current Focus: Microcode Optimization:** A significant portion of development is currently dedicated to integrating and optimizing the F3DEX3 microcode, a custom N64 graphics microcode developed by Sauraen. The goal is to leverage its advanced features and improve performance for "Return to Yoshi's Island" (RTYI).
-   **Iterative Testing and Debugging:** The stream showcases an active debugging session involving Kaze and Sauraen, comparing performance metrics between F3DEX2, an older version of F3DEX3, and the latest F3DEX3 to diagnose why the new microcode is slower in RTYI. This involves commenting out code sections, analyzing performance counters (RSP/RDP time, FIFO waits), and live troubleshooting.
-   **Level Design Progress:** Level design is well underway. Kaze mentions working on a Mario Kart 64 themed "retro pipe" area, stating it's "course 12 out of 15," indicating substantial progress in level creation.
-   **Technical Integration Challenges:** Integrating F3DEX3 has introduced specific tasks, such as needing to update the game's lighting GBI (graphics binary interface) because "Mario has no colors right now is that we changed the GBI in FBDX3."

## Personal Insights
-   **Pragmatism in Tooling:** Kaze expresses a preference for familiar and reliable tools, even if older, stating about Project64 1.6, "It's just so convenient to use. Parallel still doesn't work for me. I just can't use it."
-   **Focus on Core Game Creation:** Kaze's primary desire is to develop the game itself, rather than get bogged down in emulator or peripheral tool development: "I don't want to lose everything. No, I do not want to make my own emulator. I just want to make my N64 game. Ideally, I wouldn't have to deal with emulators at all."
-   **Awareness of Community and Online Presence:** Kaze is aware of his audience and the demands of streaming, mentioning at the end, "I got to check all the fires of people complaining about the video."
-   **Openness to Experimentation:** Kaze is willing to engage in deep technical dives and experimentation live on stream to solve problems, as seen with the F3DEX3 debugging.

## Collaborator Information
-   **Sauraen (F3DEX3 Developer):**
    -   The primary collaborator featured in this transcript. Sauraen is the creator of the F3DEX3 microcode that Kaze is implementing in RTYI.
    -   He joined the stream to help Kaze diagnose performance issues with F3DEX3, explaining its architecture and guiding Kaze through debugging steps.
    -   Sauraen also created "Sec64," a tool Kaze uses for N64 music sequence formatting.
    -   He was previously director of "Triforce%," an Ocarina of Time arbitrary code execution project.
-   **Zeina (Animations):**
    -   Mentioned indirectly in the context of a past collaboration challenge: "Someone offered to do the animations in 2021 and they kept saying I'll do it, I'll do it, I'll do it and then they didn't do it. And that's why you don't do call-ups." This highlights a past difficulty in securing animation assets. No current positive contribution from Zeina is detailed in this transcript.
-   **Badub (Composer):** No relevant information found in this transcript.
-   **Biobak (Graphics Artist):** No relevant information found in this transcript.
-   **Other Contributors:**
    -   "Ruski": Mentioned briefly by Sauraen in the context of a "new boot code" potentially preventing unauthorized reproduction of ROM hacks, not as a direct RTYI contributor.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
-   **Performance-Oriented Lighting:** Kaze prioritizes performance and emulator compatibility. For RTYI, this means "everything here is vertex colored" for static environments. Dynamic lighting is used for actors ("I use world lighting But it's only for moving actors"), sometimes with multiple directional lights ("some levels have up to like Seven light sources active at the same time"). He explicitly avoids N64 point lights for broader compatibility: "No, absolutely not [using point lights] because I want to make sure and runs fine on emulators."
-   **F3DEX3 Performance Bottleneck:** The central challenge discussed is that the new F3DEX3 microcode, despite its intended benefits, is currently running significantly slower in RTYI than older microcodes. The stream is dedicated to identifying the cause of this discrepancy (e.g., "it is a 20% higher time. So that's a little crazy").
-   **Optimizing for High Vertex Counts:** The game features scenes with high vertex counts (e.g., "a scene that has 6600 vertices"). Optimizing the RSP (Reality Signal Processor) and RDP (Reality Display Processor) pipeline for such scenes is crucial.
-   **Retro-Themed Content:** RTYI includes "retro pipes," such as a level themed after Mario Kart 64's Calamari Desert, which involves recreating assets and a specific feel.
-   **Feature vs. Performance Trade-offs:** Discussion around F3DEX3's features like "occlusion plane" involves weighing their benefits against the potential performance cost per vertex.

## Business Aspects
-   **No Direct RTYI Business Plans:** The transcript does not contain explicit information about marketing strategies, funding models, or release/distribution plans specifically for "Return to Yoshi's Island."
-   **Community Donations:** Kaze acknowledges a donation during the stream ("Thank you for the donation, one of ShyGuy"), indicating some level of community financial support through streaming.
-   **Awareness of ROM Hack Commercialization:** Sauraen discusses the issue of unauthorized commercialization of ROM hacks, citing his experience with "The Missing Link" being sold as reproduction cartridges: "...somebody is just taking our stuff and selling it... I also saw online stores that had like a hundred thousand sales of like people's romhacks they literally made millions of of that." This reflects an awareness of the broader ecosystem and its challenges.
-   **Media Presence:** Kaze notes Sauraen's feature on "Gamers Nexus," showing an awareness of media attention within the N64/modding community.

## Key Quotes
-   Kaze Emanuar: "The problem is, f3d-ex3 on my game runs significantly slower. So we need to fix that." (Highlights the central technical challenge being addressed).
-   Sauraen: "My name is Sauraen. I am a person making F3DEX3 custom microcode for N64, which Kaza is trying to use in Return to Yoshi's Island." (Introduces a key collaborator and the technology at the heart of the discussion).
-   Kaze Emanuar: "No, absolutely not [using point lights in RTYI] because I want to make sure and runs fine on emulators. So I stick to just my f3dx... everything here is vertex colored." (Explains a core design philosophy driven by performance and compatibility).

## Potential Interview Topics
-   **The Vision for F3DEX3 in RTYI:** Explore Kaze's initial reasons for adopting F3DEX3, the features he hopes to leverage, and how the current performance challenges are impacting his development roadmap and expectations.
-   **Balancing Innovation with N64 Limitations:** Discuss Kaze's approach to pushing the boundaries of what's possible on N64 hardware (e.g., with custom microcode, complex scenes) while maintaining playability and performance, especially concerning emulator compatibility.
-   **Collaboration in ROM Hacking:** Delve into the nature of Kaze's collaboration with technical experts like Sauraen. How do these partnerships form? What are the dynamics, benefits, and challenges of relying on community-developed tools and expertise?
-   **Design Philosophy for "Return to Yoshi's Island":** Ask Kaze about the overall artistic and gameplay vision for RTYI. How do technical decisions (like the lighting model or microcode choice) support or influence this creative vision? What inspired the "retro pipe" concept?
-   **Navigating the ROM Hacking Ecosystem:** Inquire about Kaze's perspective on the broader ROM hacking community, the ethics of creating and distributing hacks, his views on unauthorized commercialization, and his personal motivations for undertaking such large-scale fan projects.
