## Game Development Process
- The project is at a stage where major environmental areas are being built out. Kaze is transitioning from finishing the first area ("Chachendas in part one") to starting work on the second.
- The development process is fluid and iterative. A task like designing a volcano can lead to a spontaneous, deep brainstorming session for an entirely new character arc and minigame.
- There is a clear sense of prioritization. Core world-building and gameplay mechanics are being tackled now, while certain tasks like importing a new Mario cap model are intentionally postponed until the "end of the project."
- Kaze is actively creating new, custom shaders (e.g., the "rescale combiner") to achieve specific visual effects on N64 hardware, demonstrating a deep technical involvement in asset creation.

## Personal Insights
- Kaze's core design philosophy is to create a game that makes the player "feel something," which he contrasts with games he perceives as "soulless" or "pointless," like *Yooka-Laylee*.
- He has a strong vision for a dynamic and evolving game world. The concept that "The island goes through permanent change as you're on it" is a central, guiding principle for the project.
- He values emergent, surprising game events. He wants to implement triggers that feel random to the player, making "the island feel alive."
- Kaze has a cynical view of modern pop culture and philosophy, stating, "I'll be honest, I know very little about pop culture or philosophy or something like that. I think it is all stupid." This suggests a focus on personal, first-principles-based creativity.

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub:** No relevant information found.
- **Biobak:**
    - Biobak is the primary graphics artist, responsible for polishing and refining the visual elements of the game.
    - The workflow involves Kaze implementing initial ideas and shaders, with the understanding that "Biobak will polish it up and make it look better." Biobak also remakes assets, such as the Goombas.
- **Zeina:** No relevant information found. (Note: A "Zayna" or "Zeina" is mentioned, but only in a personal context related to being in the same house, not in a professional, collaborative context.)
- **Other Contributors:**
    - The **live stream chat community** acts as a collective collaborator. They provide suggestions (e.g., the volcano erupting) and feedback that directly influence the game's design in real-time.
    - **Caleb White** is mentioned in a joking context ("Unthankful for Caleb White's VRM for you"), suggesting he may have provided a VRM (virtual reality model) for Kaze's streaming avatar.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Technical Challenges:** Development is frequently hindered by bugs in the primary tool, "Fast64" (also referred to as Frost64). These bugs affect visual elements like opacity, lighting, and decal rendering, forcing Kaze to work around them or postpone fixes. He is sometimes reluctant to try potential fixes that might introduce other, more significant issues.
- **World Design:** A key design principle is creating a dynamic world. A major event brainstormed is a volcano eruption that is triggered by player progression (e.g., reaching a certain star count). This event permanently alters the landscape of the first area, adding a new stone platform and an NPC.
- **Character/Quest Design:** The stream documents the complete evolution of a quest idea. It begins with a standard bully boss fight, evolves into a "lame" idea of the bully offering demolition services, and culminates in a unique and creative concept: the reformed bully pursuing his dream of becoming a singer, resulting in a rhythm-based minigame for the player.
- **Gameplay vs. Overworld:** There is a clear distinction between designing in-level boss fights and designing overworld interactions. Kaze prioritizes making the overworld star quest "fun" and meaningful over perfecting the initial boss fight, stating, "We don't try to make a good boss fight, we try to make a good overworld right now."

## Business Aspects
- The project appears to be at least partially funded through direct community support via live stream monetization. Kaze acknowledges receiving donations and subscriptions during the stream (e.g., "thank you for the free 5 pounds," "thank you for the 100 bits").
- There is no mention of traditional publishers, marketing plans, or a formal release schedule.

## Key Quotes
- **On Design Philosophy:** "The purpose of any art piece really is to make you feel something, right? And you kind of have to take all the elements and turn them in a way where the feeling you want the player to experience becomes real."
- **On World Building:** "Yes! The island goes through permanent change as you're on it... I'm thinking there should be a lot of really random triggers like that. Where people don't even know why it happened. It just seems like it randomly happens. And the island feels alive."
- **On Creative Process:** "Okay, I have a stupid idea. What if, on the long, his dream was to become a singer and he's like, I'm done being bad, I'm gonna pursue my dreams now and I'm gonna become a singer. And then there's a singing minigame."

## Potential Interview Topics
- **The "Living World" Philosophy:** Explore the origins and technical implementation of the core concept that "the island goes through permanent change." How does this idea influence level design and player progression on a macro scale?
- **Community-Driven Design:** Discuss the role of the live stream audience in the creative process. How does Kaze filter feedback, and can he point to specific moments, like the "volcano eruption" suggestion, that fundamentally shaped the game?
- **The Bully's Song:** Unpack the evolution of the reformed bully character, from a simple boss to a singing NPC. This serves as a perfect case study for the project's iterative and spontaneous design process.
- **Working Within (and Against) Limitations:** Delve into the challenges of using tools like Fast64. How do these technical hurdles and bugs force creative workarounds, and how does that impact the final product?
- **The Kaze/Biobak Workflow:** Detail the collaborative dynamic. How are tasks divided, and how does the two-phase process (Kaze's prototype, Biobak's polish) benefit the game's development and final look?
