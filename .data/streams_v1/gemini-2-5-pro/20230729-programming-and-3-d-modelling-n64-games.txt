## Game Development Process
- The game "Return to Yoshi's Island" is an N64 ROM hack. The stream shows work on the 11th course, an oil rig level.
- Kaze states there are "Four after this [levels until complete]" for the game.
- Current development focus is on the oil rig level, specifically:
    - Implementing Koopa Troopa NPC interactions and "trolls" (messing with them).
    - Designing and modeling a Wiggler character to act as an "overseer" who reacts to the player's actions.
    - Creating animations for characters like baby penguins (walking, waddle, dive) and the Wiggler.
    - Refining mechanics like glass shattering, ensuring they are visually convincing without complex physics simulations.
    - Working on NPC dialogue and reactions to player actions.
- A major milestone anticipated is finishing the first star/mission of the current oil rig level, involving the Wiggler and various Koopa interactions.
- The engine is described as "super optimized" to run on real N64 hardware.
- Skybox for the current level is a placeholder and will eventually be an "infinitely far background."

## Personal Insights
- Kaze reflects on his growth as a designer: "Back when I was making last impact I was just like whenever I had an idea i would just put it in almost like unfiltered and i would definitely like think more about what actually is worth putting in and less like just put stuff in you know... I should have been spending at least 20 of the time designing."
- He expresses a strong dislike for "cryptic" game design, preferring intuitive mechanics, leading to decisions like scrapping an oil barrel puzzle.
- Kaze values humor and expressiveness in character animations and interactions, as seen with the Koopas' reactions.
- He has strong opinions on control schemes, advocating for "controller plus mouse" as a superior setup.
- He believes that simply because "Mario 64 does it is a bad excuse overall" for design choices, indicating a willingness to deviate from the base game's conventions if he sees better alternatives.

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub (Badub):**
    - Is composing the soundtrack for the oil rig level in "Return to Yoshi's Island."
    - Kaze mentions Badub "has some pretty good ideas" and is still working on the track, with Kaze finding some parts not "perfect yet" but liking the overall direction.
- **Biobak (Biobak):**
    - Mentioned humorously in the context of a song Kaze plays ("this would be like his theme song").
    - No specific contributions to "Return to Yoshi's Island" are detailed in this transcript, though the prompt implies he is a graphics artist for the project.
- **Zeina:**
    - Is responsible for animations. Kaze states, "She's making all of them [penguin animations] right now."
    - Zeina confirms her role: "I'm just helping out with animations. And anything else that he needs."
    - She provides input on model details (e.g., closing a hole in the penguin model).
    - Kaze anticipates the Wiggler will be "probably the most difficult one to animate yet," a task likely falling to Zeina.
    - She is also working on penguin idle animations.
- **Other Contributors:**
    - **Zero World:** Mentioned as "making music right now for one of the 8-bit sections in this game." He is allowed to make changes to improve existing loops.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Oil Rig Level Theme:** The core concept is a mission where the player messes with various Koopa NPCs. "The idea is just that you mess with a bunch of NPCs and you just mess with everyone once. That's like the whole mission."
- **Glass Shattering Mechanic:**
    - Initial ideas involved many small pieces, which was deemed too much work for modeling and importing.
    - Iterated to a simpler two-piece split, with a focus on "faking" physics to look convincing.
    - Koopas carrying the glass react with sadness/anger when it's broken.
- **Scrapping the Oil Slick Puzzle:** An idea involving kicking an oil barrel to make a Koopa slip was removed because Kaze felt "kicking the oil barrel is not intuitive and also that's not very funny."
- **Wiggler Overseer:**
    - Introduced as a character who gets progressively more upset as the player completes "trolls" on Koopas.
    - Design challenge: Balancing the visual detail (e.g., multiple hard hats on segments) with the N64's polygon budget. "Yeah, but a thousand triangles is too much. Can't waste my polygon budget like that." This led to simplifying the model.
- **Wing Cap Inclusion:** Decided to add a Wing Cap as an optional "cool stupid bonus" in the oil rig level, not required for progression.
    - Challenge: Preventing players from accessing out-of-bounds areas. Solution: Using an "invisible wall."
- **Lighting Issues:** Kaze acknowledges some lighting problems ("Please try to fix the lighting issues please") but seems to believe they will be resolved eventually, possibly by chance or by fixing specific problematic assets (like a box).
- **NPC Dialogue:** Writing specific lines for Koopas reacting to their predicaments, e.g., "That was the only glass window they had bowser's gonna be pissed," or "There goes this year's salary."

## Business Aspects
- No direct mentions of marketing, funding, or specific release plans for "Return to Yoshi's Island" itself within this transcript.
- Kaze mentions receiving free hardware (capture cards, monitors, speakers, projectors) from Chinese manufacturers for review, which relates to his broader presence as a developer and streamer rather than RTYI funding.

## Key Quotes
- "So right now we're making this oil rig level, where you just mess with Bowser's minions. You destroy their plans to like build Bowser's base here." (Kaze explaining the current level of RTYI)
- "Back when I was making last impact I was just like whenever I had an idea I would just put it in almost like unfiltered and I would definitely like think more about what actually is worth putting in and less like just put stuff in you know." (Kaze on his evolving design philosophy)
- "Dude, having the first mission done is gonna feel so huge." (Kaze on completing the main objective in the current oil rig level)
- "Yeah, but a thousand triangles is too much. Can't waste my polygon budget like that." (Kaze on balancing visual detail with N64 limitations for the Wiggler model)

## Potential Interview Topics
- Explore Kaze's overarching vision for "Return to Yoshi's Island": How does this oil rig level and its "mess with NPCs" theme fit into the larger narrative or game structure?
- Delve into the collaborative workflow: How do Kaze, Zeina (animations), and Badub (music) typically exchange ideas, provide feedback, and integrate their work for a cohesive level experience?
- Discuss the evolution of Kaze's game design principles from earlier projects like "Last Impact" to "Return to Yoshi's Island," particularly his approach to balancing player freedom, intuitive design, and comedic elements within the N64's constraints.
- Investigate the technical hurdles and innovative solutions involved in developing a large-scale ROM hack on original N64 hardware, touching upon engine optimization, polygon budgeting, and achieving desired visual/gameplay effects.
- Unpack the decision-making process for specific interactive elements in the oil rig level (e.g., Koopa reactions, Wiggler behavior, glass breaking): How are ideas brainstormed, prototyped, and refined or discarded based on fun factor, technical feasibility, and intuitiveness?
