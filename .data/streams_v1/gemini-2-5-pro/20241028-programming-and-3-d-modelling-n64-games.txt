## Game Development Process
- Significant progress reported over the "last few weeks," with enough content for multiple video clips.
- Current focus involves working on implementing and debugging "little actors" and specific game mechanics, such as a box-opening mechanism.
- A core aspect of the development is Kaze "rewriting Mario 64," which is a substantial undertaking he is considering making a video about.
- Performance optimization is an ongoing concern, with adjustments made to elements like drawing distance to improve frame rates.
- The game includes unique level concepts, like a "swamp" area and a "cardboard box to hell."
- Kaze is implementing a "Yoshi Stars" system, similar to Mario Galaxy's comets, offering special missions for stars (e.g., "get the red coins with two or less A presses"). 45 are planned.
- The development involves detailed animation work, such as for the box opening tab and enhancing the Mario model.

## Personal Insights
- Kaze aims for a specific game feel: "it feels very risky to play, I think. So it's fine if it's not super difficult, like that actually is desirable, it's not difficult."
- He prioritizes thematic consistency in design: "Don't want to make a Romic exhibiting random technology. That's not what I'm interested in."
- Kaze is deeply immersed in the development process: "I just make games. I don't have space in my brain to think about those things" (re: tracking time spent on levels).
- He acknowledges the rarity of completed mods: "Most mods never get finished. It's very rare that a mod gets finished, you guys are just spoiled because you are watching me."
- He expresses clear opinions on various topics, including public figures and industry practices, and shares personal background details (German living in Canada, studied mathematics).

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: No relevant information found in this transcript regarding Badub's contributions as a composer.
- Biobak (referred to as "Biobak" in the transcript):
    - Contributes ideas for game mechanics; for example, "The first idea Biobak had was that it would be a zipper that would be attached to here, and then you would open the zipper."
    - Provides visual references or mock-ups, as Kaze mentions, "I don't have the screenshot from Biobak open anymore."
    - Appears to be a regular contact with whom Kaze discusses ideas.
- Zeina: No relevant information found in this transcript regarding Zeina's contributions to animations.
- Other Contributors:
    - **Arthur Tilly:** Appears to be a viewer/commenter Kaze interacts with.
    - **Tito:** A viewer who thanked Kaze.
    - **DeathWizard:** Mentioned as the creator of a "Mario 64 Wordle," not a direct collaborator on "Return to Yoshi's Island."

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Box Opening Mechanic:** Iterative design process for opening a "cardboard box to hell." Ideas explored included a zipper, a piece of tape, staples, and finally a "cardboard box opener" tab that Mario pulls. Challenges included animating this tab smoothly and making it look convincing without being too performance-intensive.
- **Mario Model Enhancement:** The Mario model is an "HD-ified version" with more details, including a nose that jiggles, 3D buttons on his overalls, glove textures, and a color line on his shoes.
- **Performance Optimization:** Addressed poor performance by adjusting the drawing distance for objects, which was previously set to infinite. Also, optimizing materials in levels (e.g., mountain textures).
- **Debugging:** Significant time spent debugging issues, such as:
    - A bug causing Mario to let go of Bowser unexpectedly, which seemed to be emulator-specific (Project 64 vs. Nemu) and was eventually traced to code related to resetting the intro scene and an incorrect use of "action arc" vs. "action state."
    - Visual glitches with animations (e.g., the box opening tab "curling").
    - Collision problems.
- **Level Aesthetics:** Trying to achieve a specific "crafty" look, like "paper on paper," for level elements like the floor, and finding it "hard to reach."
- **Yoshi Stars Implementation:** Designing missions for the "Yoshi Stars" that add optional challenges.

## Business Aspects
- **YouTube Content Strategy:** Kaze actively thinks about video titles for engagement, such as "why I've been rewriting Mario 64." He plans videos to showcase his work.
- **Monetization:** Mentions that "Twitter monetization grind is going way better than I thought."
- **YouTube Shorts Evaluation:** Experimented with YouTube Shorts but found them to be a poor return on investment: "The problem is with shots, you're never going to make the money back... investment wise, has not been a wise decision." He also set his shorts to not be pushed to subscribers, treating it as an experiment.
- No direct mentions of funding for "Return to Yoshi's Island" or specific release/distribution plans for the game itself were found in this transcript.

## Key Quotes
- "This is kind of how I envisioned this. This is like, it feels very risky to play, I think. So it's fine if it's not super difficult, like that actually is desirable, it's not difficult." (On game feel)
- "Don't want to make a Romic exhibiting random technology. That's not what I'm interested in." (On design philosophy)
- "Most mods never get finished. It's very rare that a mod gets finished, you guys are just spoiled because you are watching me." (On the nature of game modding)
- "The reason it ran poorly is because back from my other RoMac, I still had the drawing distance for everything set at infinite." (On a specific technical challenge and solution)

## Potential Interview Topics
1.  **The "Rewriting Mario 64" Foundation:** Explore the technical and creative implications of Kaze "rewriting Mario 64" for "Return to Yoshi's Island." How does this differ from traditional ROM hacking, and what new possibilities does it open up?
2.  **Collaborative Design with Biobak:** Delve into the dynamic between Kaze and Biobak. How are ideas typically generated and iterated upon? Can they share an example of a feature that evolved significantly through their collaboration?
3.  **Achieving the "Crafty" Aesthetic and "Risky" Gameplay:** Discuss the specific design choices and technical approaches Kaze is using to realize the desired "crafty" visual style and the "risky but not super difficult" gameplay feel. What are the main challenges in balancing these elements?
4.  **The "Yoshi Stars" System:** Elaborate on the inspiration and design goals for the "Yoshi Stars" missions. How do these missions integrate into the overall game structure, and what kind of variety can players expect?
5.  **Navigating Emulator Differences and Debugging:** Kaze mentioned a bug behaving differently on Project 64 versus Nemu. Discuss the challenges of developing for an emulated N64 environment and his general approach to tackling complex, elusive bugs.
