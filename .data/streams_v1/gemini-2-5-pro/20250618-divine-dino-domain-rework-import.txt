## Game Development Process
- The development is in an iterative, detail-oriented phase, focusing on reworking and implementing assets for a specific level, "Course 10" (C10).
- The process involves a tight loop of receiving assets from a collaborator (Biobak), integrating them into the game engine, debugging technical issues (e.g., texture formats, rendering bugs), and refining the implementation live on stream.
- A significant amount of time is dedicated to bug-fixing and engine optimization. Kaze mentions spending a lot of time "debugging a lot of really annoying stuff" to get closer to "zero engine bugs."
- Key tasks shown include importing new 3D models (Yoshi, environment props), setting up collision maps for new geometry, fixing animation bugs, and adjusting visual parameters like color and lighting.

## Personal Insights
- Kaze expresses immense pride in the technical optimization of the game, believing it pushes the N64 hardware to its limits. He states, "I don't think you can even make the case that there's a better looking N64 game than this like anywhere in the world."
- He has strong, unfiltered opinions on development methodologies, dismissing Entity Component Systems as "complete garbage" and favoring direct, low-level control over the hardware and code structure.
- He shows a deep confidence in his own abilities and memory, stating, "I have never in my life broken something without being able to figure out what I broke. So I wouldn't know. I'm very good at just remembering my code."
- He is transparent about the frustrations of development, candidly reacting to bugs in Blender, the game engine, and even the Windows operating system, which provides a raw look at the daily hurdles of a developer.

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub:** No relevant information found.
- **Biobak:** Biobak is the primary graphics artist for the assets shown. He sent Kaze a "rework of course too" (C10) with a changelog and a batch of new models and textures. The stream revolves around Kaze integrating Biobak's work, which includes a new Yoshi model, environmental props (bushes, floors), and assets for a boss fight (donut). Their collaboration requires Kaze to make technical adjustments to Biobak's art to fit engine constraints (e.g., changing color types).
- **Zeina:** Mentioned in greetings ("hello Zayna") and in a personal anecdote ("Zeina does this all the time. She calls just the sausage a hot dog..."). The prompt's context suggests an animation role, but this specific transcript doesn't detail any direct contributions to the work being done on stream.
- **Other Contributors:**
    - **f3dx3:** Kaze gives a shout-out to "f3dx3" for providing "automatic patching," indicating this is a contributor to a tool or library that simplifies the development workflow.
    - **Zeinas:** Mentioned humorously as having "banished" Kaze to the basement. This is likely a personal reference to a partner or housemate, not a development role.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Vertex Color Lighting:** Kaze champions the use of vertex colors to bake static lighting and shading directly into level geometry. He describes it as a "strictly superior technique for static geometry without moving lights" for the N64, citing its efficiency despite the trade-off of losing dynamic lighting effects on those surfaces.
- **Performance Optimization:** A core design principle is obsessive optimization for N64 hardware. Kaze discusses reordering actors in the level data to improve cache proximity and his success in optimizing to the point where "Mario's behavior loop never gets thrown out of cache."
- **Iterative Asset Integration:** A recurring challenge is the technical integration of art assets. This includes fixing models with incorrect texture formats ("the texture has too many colors again"), dealing with rendering inconsistencies between the Fast64 plugin and emulators, and modifying assets to work with the engine's specific requirements (e.g., changing a material from "environment color" to "primitive color" due to a known bug).
- **Bug-Fixing:** The stream highlights numerous real-time bug fixes, from a simple "illegal operation" (two textures in one cycle) to a more complex logical bug causing an NPC (Yoshi) to repeat its dialogue.

## Business Aspects
- **Merchandising:** Kaze has launched a new merchandise store on TeePublic. He shows off a "course 4 shirt" and mentions plans to "make a design for every course with the course icon from the final game." This represents a direct effort to monetize the project's brand and community.
- **Sponsored Community Event:** Kaze announces "F3 2025," a community event that will be "a sponsored event this time." He plans to use the sponsorship to offer a "cash reward" to the most popular fan game, creating an incentive for the wider N64 homebrew community.

## Key Quotes
- "I don't think you can even make the case that there's a better looking N64 game than this like anywhere in the world. I think it's just untrue." (Reflects Kaze's pride in the game's visual and technical achievements).
- "For static level geometry like this, we can just bake the lighting right away, right? So it is just a strictly superior technique for static geometry without moving lights." (Summarizes his design philosophy on efficient rendering for the N64).
- "Biobak made a nice out of it one. That's what's wrong with it." (A joking but insightful comment on why he's replacing the old Yoshi model, highlighting the collaborative and iterative nature of improving the game).

## Potential Interview Topics
- **The Kaze & Biobak Workflow:** Explore the dynamic between the technical programmer (Kaze) and the artist (Biobak). How do they handle creative differences and the technical limitations of the N64? How does their feedback loop work?
- **The Philosophy of N64 Optimization:** Ask Kaze to elaborate on his passion for pushing the N64 to its limits. Why is achieving "zero warnings" and optimal cache performance so important to him, and how does that philosophy shape the game's design?
- **Art Direction through Vertex Colors:** Discuss the decision to rely heavily on vertex colors for lighting. What creative possibilities does this open up, and what are the biggest limitations he has had to design around?
- **From Passion Project to Brand:** Inquire about the move into merchandising and sponsored events. What are his long-term goals for the "Return to Yoshi's Island" project and the "F3" event as a community platform?
- **The Role of the Decompilation Project:** How has the Super Mario 64 decompilation project enabled a game of this scope and ambition? What does it feel like to be building directly on top of the original game's foundation?
