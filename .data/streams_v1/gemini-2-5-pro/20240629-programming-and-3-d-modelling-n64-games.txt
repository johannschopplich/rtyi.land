## Game Development Process
- **Overall Progress & Stability:** Kaze has been refactoring the "Return to Yoshi's Island" (RTUI) codebase, resulting in improved stability and getting the game to work on N64 hardware again. Many crashes have been fixed.
- **Current Stage:** Kaze is working on the 13th level. Significant work remains, including boss levels, two side levels, a "huge part of the overworld," followed by bug testing and beta testing.
- **New Systems/Optimizations:**
    - A new system for rendering HUD elements has been implemented, saving "a few precious microseconds in every level" and providing a global performance gain.
    - Kaze has an idea for another optimization: putting frame buffers into separate memory segments, potentially yielding a 2-3% performance boost (equating to a full FPS).
- **Content Creation:** This stream focused on developing the "Raven" enemy for an ice-themed level, including its model import, behavior programming (spawning, movement, turning, attacking), and visual appearance (ice material).
- **Development Tools/Environment:** The game is based on the Mario 64 decompilation project. Kaze uses tools like Blender for animations/models and Fast64. He codes in C.

## Personal Insights
- **Game Design Philosophy:** Kaze states, "To me, games is about experiencing new ideas and concepts." He expresses a preference for games that offer novelty over those that feel "very samey" (referring to some types of ROM hacks).
- **Perception of Game Development:** He describes the effort involved poetically: "Making this game is honestly like scaling 50 Everests. That pretty much encapsulates how I feel about making video games."
- **Openness and Honesty:** Kaze is frank about challenges ("This is gonna be a complicated enemy to program"), bugs, and his own state (e.g., being tired). He also openly discusses design decisions and seeks community feedback.
- **Pride in Technical Skill:** He confidently discusses low-level N64 details, assembly, and memory addresses, reflecting deep technical knowledge.

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub (Composer):** While Badub is not directly named as contributing in this transcript, Kaze refers to himself as a "music director" who gives "directions" for the music. He also discusses OST choices, indicating ongoing music development for the game.
- **Biobak (Graphics Artist):** The prompt identifies Biobak as a graphics artist. In this transcript, a viewer named "Biobak" (who may or may not be the same person) made a significant design suggestion for the Raven enemy: having them pop out of the ground/ice, which Kaze adopted for being "cooler and easier to program." No specific graphical asset contributions from "Biobak" are detailed in this particular segment.
- **Zeina (Animations/Models):**
    - Provided the 3D model for the Raven enemy: "Zeina you sent me the model, right?"
    - Created animations, such as a "dilly dally" animation mentioned for the Raven.
    - Kaze discusses texture issues ("What did Lena do?") and model orientation with reference to Zeina's work. Zeina also provides input on the Raven's material and color (e.g., "The beak and the feet should be more green").
- **Other Contributors:**
    - **Michi Michi:** "Michi Michi I looked at your functions yesterday. I integrated some of them. It's pretty good." (Contribution: Code functions).
    - **Dan Salvato:** "So I talked to Dan Salvato and he said that the dive jump we have is kind of like against the design of Mario 64 and I can kind of see it." (Contribution: Design feedback on a core mechanic).
    - **Viewers (general):** Kaze frequently interacts with viewers, taking suggestions for enemy ideas and discussing design choices.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Raven Enemy Design:**
    - **Initial Concept & Iteration:** Planned to walk on geometry and turn. This was deemed "a complicated enemy to program."
    - **Revised Concept (influenced by Biobak):** Ravens will now pop out of the ground/ice, walk a path, and then disappear. This is "cooler and easier to program."
    - **Appearance:** Decided they should be made of ice (using a material similar to "freezies") with distinct colors for parts, rather than snow. The boss version ("Raffle the Raven") will be an actual raven, likely black, and incorporate moon/cosmic elements.
    - **Behavior:** Programmed to spawn from surfaces, move forward, turn at set points or when hitting walls/no ground, and eventually despawn. Their attack will damage Mario.
- **Dive Jump Mechanic:**
    - **Challenge:** Received feedback from Dan Salvato that the existing dive jump (allowing mid-air angle changes) is unlike other SM64 moves and potentially too powerful or abusable by skilled players, while not helping bad players.
    - **Proposed Solution:** Kaze is considering limiting the dive jump to provide only a small angle change, making it a minor advantage for experienced players rather than a powerful corrective tool. He solicited viewer opinions on this.
- **Level Design (Ice Level):** Described as a "surreal ice palace" with "some mindfuck stuff going on." It's intended to be "kind of like a mace-like level [maze-like]" with different paths and obstacles.
- **Optimization & Performance:** A constant consideration, with new HUD rendering systems and plans for frame buffer optimization to maintain N64 performance.
- **Bug Fixing:** Addressed issues like Ravens falling through the floor, incorrect spawning, shadow rendering problems, and animation glitches live on stream. Kaze also identified an issue with Fast64 regarding order of operations affecting exported values.
- **Player Experience:** Kaze discusses making enemies feel right, ensuring interactions are fun (e.g., bouncing on wall-walking Ravens for a Yoshi coin), and considering player feedback for mechanics like shaking ice when frozen.

## Business Aspects
- **Release Timeline:** Kaze estimates the game might be "maybe two to three years more or so" from release, acknowledging it's a long-term project.
- **Streaming as Engagement:** The stream itself is a form of engagement, with Kaze having a regular weekly schedule. Viewer interactions like "cum shake" redemptions (a channel point feature) are part of this, though not direct funding for game development.
- **No Explicit Commercial Plans:** As a ROM hack, there's no discussion of commercial sale or traditional marketing campaigns. The focus is on creation and community sharing.

## Key Quotes
- "Yeah, I Spent some time this week Refactoring some of the RTUI code base. I Got it working on n64 again Fixed a lot of crashes. The game is a lot more stable. Now." (Highlights progress and technical focus)
- "Making this game is honestly like scaling 50 Everests. That pretty much encapsulates how I feel about making video games." (Kaze's reflection on the immense effort of game development)
- "So I talked to Dan Salvato and he said that the dive jump we have is kind of like against the design of Mario 64... So what I was thinking of doing was to limit the use of the dive a little bit more." (Illustrates design iteration based on peer feedback and respecting original game design)
- "Shit, you're right. Just like ice minions popping out... Dang, you have some convincing arguments, Biobak. You mean like pop out of ground, walk forwards, around the corner and then just disappear back in? Yeah, that would be so much easier." (Shows community influence on design and pragmatic decision-making)
