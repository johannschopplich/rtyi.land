## Game Development Process
- Currently working on a level that Biobak remade, importing assets with some still pending from Biobak
- Implementing lighting effects including light from windows and ceilings in various areas
- Working on sparkle effects along electrical lines in the factory area
- Next planned work includes boss area and factory elements, with hopes to finish over the weekend
- Mentions being stuck on ice castle development "for a bit," planning to return to it next week
- Using new Blender 4 for development but notes: "I am not a fan of it. They messed up some important things"
- Dealing with ongoing technical challenges including rendering bugs in Glideon

## Personal Insights
- Strong negative feelings about Super Mario Sunshine: "I have so much hatred in my heart for Super Mario Sunshine. I hate the game to like an unreasonable degree. And it's because of the fucking cutscenes... every single time the game takes control away from me, it just feels like a small kick to my balls"
- Pragmatic approach to code optimization: "I have accepted that most code is written pretty unoptimized"
- Preference for simple food like kebab: "Kebab might just be the best food in the world"
- Recent experience with Five Nights at Freddy's: "I played Five Nights at Freddy's for the first time last week, and I'm extremely confused how people could possibly like this"
- Frustration with German bureaucracy despite not living there for three years

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: No relevant information found in this transcript
- Biobak: Graphics artist who remade the level being worked on, still creating additional assets, provided fan models and other graphical elements, actively participates in stream chat providing feedback on visual elements
- Zeina: Briefly mentioned in chat greetings, specific animation contributions not detailed in this transcript
- Other Contributors: No additional core contributors identified; stream viewers participate in chat but appear to be community members rather than development team

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Implementing "touch fuzzy get dizzy" effect with visual distortion and music changes
- Dealing with rendering limitations: "We have a really unfortunate render bug here... Nothing we can do about that. It's supposed to light up each ball individually. But Glideon has a bug"
- Considering player punishment mechanics: "I think there should be a death animation at place when Mario falls in the oil you can just respawn with less health. I don't want that to be that punishing for no reason"
- Adding special camera system for elevator sequences to improve player experience
- Working within memory constraints: "I don't think I can add them to the course because this course is very low on memory"
- Implementing visual polish like oil decals on Mario after falling

## Business Aspects

## Key Quotes
- "I was working on this level here that Biobak remade. I imported all the assets and there's some assets Biobak still wants to make. But so far so good, I would say."
- "You shouldn't touch fuzzy because if you touch fuzzy you get dizzy... How fucking cool is that effect, dude?"
- "I don't want that to be that punishing for no reason, you know, I think it's not really necessary that we just kill the player"

## Potential Interview Topics
- The collaborative workflow between Kaze and Biobak for level design and asset creation
- Technical innovation within N64 hardware limitations, particularly regarding lighting and visual effects
- Design philosophy around difficulty and player punishment in ROM hacks
- The challenges and benefits of developing publicly through livestreaming
- How the team handles technical limitations and bugs that cannot be fixed due to engine constraints
