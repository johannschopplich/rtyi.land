## Game Development Process
- Currently polishing visual elements of what appears to be a desert/western themed level, working on quicksand effects and skybox improvements
- The game is running at 25-30 FPS on actual N64 hardware without full optimization implemented yet
- F3DX3 graphics microcode optimization is in development and expected to provide significant performance improvements
- Level design was intentionally ambitious, created with the assumption that culling planes would help manage performance
- Regular testing on actual N64 hardware to ensure compatibility and performance

## Personal Insights
- Takes significant pride in the game's optimization: "I'm gonna brag about this forever... he thinks that in Return to Yoshi's Island the memory and RDP is so optimized that with F3dx3 the RSP becomes the bottleneck"
- Believes the game surpasses other N64 titles visually: "Do you guys actually think Banjo-Tooie looks as good as this? Because I just don't think so"
- Frustrated with current YouTube content trends focusing on drama rather than meaningful content
- Committed to maintaining artistic vision: "No, I want the blue colors. That's already decided... It is too late to undo that"
- Values playing and testing his own creations: "Of course, I play them. How am I going to test them without playing them?"

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: The composer who "wants to make all of" the music for RTYI. Kaze mentions this is why others weren't asked to compose
- Biobak: Graphics artist who "wanted to help me rework a bunch of levels" but has been absent recently. Kaze expresses concern: "I hope he's not gone. That'd be really unfortunate"
- Zeina: No specific information found in this transcript
- Other Contributors:
  - Sauron: Technical collaborator working on F3DX3 optimization specifically for RTYI's unique performance profile
  - Kaze's wife: Playtests the game ("I have my wife play it too")

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Struggling with quicksand visual representation: "quicksand is not it, definitely not. Even this looks terrible"
- Fog color matching between skybox and level geometry proved challenging due to technical limitations
- Committed to blue fog aesthetic established early in development despite suggestions to change it
- Implementing background cliffs with parallax effects to add visual depth while managing performance
- Balancing visual ambition with N64 hardware limitations: "The problem is, we can't really draw them too far out, because then we get render distance issues"
- Working on train object with proper pitch and rotation adjustments for realism

## Business Aspects
- Considering OST cartridge release: "I'm hoping that I can release RTYI alongside an OST cartridge"
- Mentions being approached by a company wanting to make an N64 game in 2024
- Recognizes marketing value of N64 development: "if you have the marketing of, hey, this is an N64 game, but there's also a PC port available, it's kind of insane. That would make the news and you would get so much marketing for free"
- Discusses how making an N64 game addresses the typical indie game problem of visibility

## Key Quotes
- "Dude, this actually looks incredible for N64. You can even see these. 29. You failed, big guy."
- "This is what Sauron told me... he thinks that in Return to Yoshi's Island the memory and RDP is so optimized that with F3dx3 the RSP becomes the bottleneck."
- "The crazy part about this is that I made this level layout knowing that this would be difficult to run, and I made this under the assumption that I would be able to use the culling planes."
