## Game Development Process
- Currently working on Course 14 enemies including "thimble guys" (shy guys made from thimbles) and "Burt the Bashful" (painted egg enemy)
- Game will have 15 main courses total, currently on the 14th course
- Planning 135 main stars and 45 Yoshi stars (special missions with restrictions like limited A presses)
- Demo release planned soon, with Patreon post being prepared
- Received major Course 2 rework from Biobak with 220 fewer triangles and 7 fewer materials while maintaining 60fps performance
- "It's going to be like 30 levels in total, but 15 main courses and we're on the 14th."

## Personal Insights
- Moved from Germany to Canada in 2021: "I'm so glad I don't live in germany anymore oh god all the bureaucracy bullshit in germany has ruined my quality of life"
- Works professionally as a C++ programmer and was hired because of his ROM hacking work: "Does Teamwork know you do this as a hobby? Yeah, they actually hired me because of this."
- Wants to create more accessible content beyond technical videos: "I'm just gonna make more generic videos that are not just for tech nerds"
- Values the idea of Yoshi's Island being fully explorable: "It is super important that the overworld is the entirety of Yoshi's Island... So it feels like you can actually explore the entire island"
- Streams for 6 years, considers workout and biological needs as limiting factors for stream length

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: Composer who created music for the cardboard/craft level. Kaze expressed mixed feelings about the track: "for me It doesn't fit the vibe Feels more like A beach at sunset Not like a complete adventure"
- Biobak/Biobak: Graphics artist who completed major Course 2 rework with improved visuals, better performance optimization, and environmental details like new windmill, brick walls, and background elements
- Zeina/Zeina: Mentioned as someone Kaze recently started playing Minecraft with ("We are like four and a half hours into the game")
- Other Contributors: "Retro" mentioned in context of level work; various unnamed contributors for animations

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Struggled with enemy defeat mechanics for thimble guys: "I need to think of a way to kill these guys. The thing is, if we make them squish, it wouldn't look like a thimble anymore. Because a thimble is hard material."
- Decided thimble enemies should work like bullies - players kick them off edges
- Technical challenge with texture scrolling for shine effects on enemy hats
- Focus on making enemies look handcrafted rather than generic
- Implementing Yoshi's Island enemy behaviors (Burt the Bashful) adapted for 3D
- Debate over level naming - considering "Handmade Heights" or "Paper Craft Peaks" for the cardboard-themed level
- Emphasis on maintaining consistent 60fps performance while adding visual improvements

## Business Aspects
- Maintains a Patreon for project updates
- Planning YouTube video strategy: BLJ explanation video, Missing Link re-release (after Nintendo takedown), and "One obscure fact about every level in Mario 64"
- Considering releasing game with separate OST cartridge as merchandise: "I was actually thinking of just releasing R.T.Y.I. Together with an OST cartridge... Because then we could sell it too As merch"
- Plans to consult lawyer before release: "But I will probably talk to a lawyer Before I release R.T.Y.I."
- No specific release date given: "Well, I never gave a release dates fortunately so that's all 100% on you"

## Key Quotes
- "It is super important that the overworld is the entirety of Yoshi's Island. It is important that you get like a 360° round view of the beach next to Yoshi's Island. So it feels like you can actually explore the entire island."
- "I think that's the kind of slop that YouTube viewers love and I think we can get famous that way." (regarding YouTube content strategy)
- "To me playing an instrument and being a musician like a composer are two completely separate things."

## Potential Interview Topics
1. The transition from hobbyist ROM hacker to professional programmer - how did the skills transfer and what opportunities emerged?
2. The collaborative process with artists and composers - how does creative feedback work when you have different visions for the same content?
3. The challenge of maintaining the "handcrafted" aesthetic while working within N64 technical limitations
4. The decision to create a fully explorable Yoshi's Island overworld and how this impacts level design and player progression
5. Navigating potential legal issues with Nintendo and the strategy for releasing and distributing a ROM hack in the current landscape
