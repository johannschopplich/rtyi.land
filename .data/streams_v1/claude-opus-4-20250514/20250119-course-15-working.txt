## Game Development Process
- Currently developing Course 15, a space-themed level with retrofuturistic aesthetic featuring flying cars, gramophones, and piano stairs
- The hub world will be all of Yoshi's Island, saved for last as "the hub world is by far the most important part of the game"
- Plans to release both as an N64 game and on Steam using static recompilation
- Uses git for constant backups whenever leaving the house
- Beta testing revealed player preferences for movement mechanics

## Personal Insights
- Exhausted from creating video content: "Making working on that video makes me feel so sick. It's so much work and so exhausting"
- Believes the hub world was crucial to Mario 64's success: "The hub world is I think the only reason Mario 64 was famous, popular. If Mario 64 hadn't had a hub world, I don't think anyone would have liked the game"
- Values player freedom in game design, avoiding taking "base Mario 64 movement away from the player too much"
- Describes being a father as "fine" with "no strong feelings about it"

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: No direct mentions in this transcript
- Biobak: Graphics artist who provided feedback on the "Octoyoshi" boss design involving black holes and tentacles. Kaze mentioned: "I was talking to Biobak about the Yoshi boss idea that we had and maybe wanted to make into the game"
- Zeina: Created artwork for shy guy NPCs ("Zayna already drew something for them") and is a long-time supporter (thanked for 48 months)
- Other Contributors:
  - GBA port developer: Recorded voice lines and footage for an upcoming video
  - Bruno/Bruno Gadsen: Provides 3D modeling work and sent retrofuturistic CRT design references
  - Simple: Playtester who apparently enjoys trolling Kaze
  - Yohan: Community supporter who gifted 20 YouTube memberships

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Retrofuturistic aesthetic chosen for space level: "We're targeting retrofuturism"
- Collision triangle limitations causing crashes on real hardware
- Movement mechanics adjusted based on beta feedback - players hated not being able to change direction during dives
- "Octoyoshi" boss design involves attacking from black holes with tentacles, requiring players to "jump into his mouth and destroy the tumors inside"
- Hub world will be "so full of secrets" with potentially more secret levels than the original game

## Business Aspects
- Plans to release on Steam with all Nintendo assets replaced: "Obviously, I would replace all Nintendo assets and would kick out the last bit of Nintendo code as well"
- Concerns about Kickstarter: "I'm scared of using Kickstarter and because of sales tax laws. I don't understand how they work with Kickstarter"
- Cannot afford to commission character design work but accepts free contributions
- Would only make N64 games if paid to do so: "The only reason I made one last year was because I was paid to do it"

## Key Quotes
- "The hub world is going to be all of Yoshi's Island. So you will be able to explore the full island. The reason I leave the hub world for last is that I think the hub world is by far the most important part of the game."
- "I was thinking maybe using the static recompilation to release this game both like as an n64 game with Mario and Officially as like a game on Steam"
- "There isn't really much left of Mario's engine there's a little bit of sound code and Obviously Mario as a character would be completely replaced. So Mario's character wouldn't be in there anymore or any of Mars movement code"
