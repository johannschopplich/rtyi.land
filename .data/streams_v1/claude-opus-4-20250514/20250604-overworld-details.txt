## Game Development Process
- Project is in final stages: "we finished 15 courses now and now we're just finishing the overworld. So we are like the final stretch"
- Game scope is massive: "It is a gigantic game probably four times the size of the original and it all runs on real hardware"
- Remaining work includes parts 10, 11, 12, and 13 of the overworld
- Currently working on "the first art pass" which is "very promising"
- Major audio fix achieved: "The audio crackling is gone. Crackling, dude, can you believe it?"

## Personal Insights
- Kaze expresses frustration with game development: "Developing video games is suffering. The Buddhists had it right when they said that life is suffering"
- Self-deprecating about gaming: "People don't believe me when I say I hate video games. Until they see me play a video game"
- Acknowledges the project's complexity is causing delays: "I think the main reason this hack is taking long is because we have like character interactions and stuff"
- Shows excitement about technical achievements: "I love this so much" (regarding ambient sounds implementation)
- Personal life update: Lives in Canada since 2021 with wife and baby

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: No direct mentions in this transcript
- Biobak: Greeted at stream start ("Hello Biobak, someone. Long time no see") - appears to be a regular stream viewer/collaborator
- Zeina: Mentioned at end of stream ("me and Zeina we want to go to the beach still") - appears to have personal relationship with Kaze
- Other Contributors:
  - Soren: Working on custom F3DX3 microcode that increased precision eightfold; needs certain level fixes from Kaze
  - Fnatic: Needs to be notified about certain issues
  - Lachmelot: Had "secret conversations" with Kaze

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Implemented ambient sound effects throughout levels: "You hear all the sounds? Makes this feel so much better... the elevator sound here? And the fire. And the rollercoaster sounds"
- Memory management issues: "I think we're out of memory in this level so let me just make up some memory by killing unused assets"
- Oversight with wing cap level: "We indeed do not have the wing cap planned in. How did I forget about that?"
- Emulator compatibility challenges: Multiple mentions of crashes and issues with different emulators
- Custom microcode development: "F3DX3. Which is like a custom microcode that Soren is working on... That has increased the precision eightfold"
- Overworld size considerations: "This is gonna be like the biggest overworld in a Mario game ever"

## Business Aspects
- Merchandise discussions: "I was actually in talk with a merch company today. And if you're lucky, we can organize those"
- Has a professional game programming job under NDA: "My real job is not a game design job. It's a game programmer job. And I can't tell you what I'm making without breaking NDA"
- Working with Unreal Engine 5 professionally: "after working with unreal engine 5 for so long I Feel like if I ever wanted to make my own game, I would use my own engine"

## Key Quotes
- "So we are like the final stretch. It is a gigantic game probably four times the size of the original and it all runs on real hardware"
- "Developing video games is suffering. The Buddhists had it right when they said that life is suffering. Because what do you do if you're not suffering? Scrolling TikTok reels?"
- "I think the main reason this hack is taking long is because we have like character interactions and stuff"
