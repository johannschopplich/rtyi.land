## Game Development Process
- Main development focus: "So our mission today is fixing the Goombas fight. Biobak wanted to make a few changes to it."
- N64 compatibility improvements: "I fixed a lot of N64 bugs this past 2 days" and "So yeah these lights work correctly now too on N64. Isn't that nice?"
- Technical achievements: Successfully implemented mipmaps ("Look at this. Mipmaps. I did it.") and attempted bloom effects (though deemed too expensive at 7ms RDP time)
- Animation and model work: "Also we need to reimport that Goomba King with the proper animations"
- Overall project is "Return to Yoshi's Island," described as "a ROM hack based on the Mario 64 decompilation"

## Personal Insights
- On audience misunderstanding: "It's also like that people don't understand that I'm making a game. They think I'm just making videos."
- On channel identity: "What are you expecting to see on my channel other than Mario 64? Why are you following my channel in the first place if it wasn't Mario 64?"
- Philosophy on game development: "if you want to be successful making video games you need to be mentally unwell. That is 100% the prerequisite. You need to be completely insane."
- On persistence: "You just can't be like well, can I do it? Let's just do it. Oh, there's no reward in it for me doing this, but I gotta. And then you just do it."
- Response to criticism: "I'm not that kind of emotional person. No. I'm the kind of person who will purposefully attract negative comments just to get feedback. And then I will use that feedback to improve my work."

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: No relevant information found in this transcript
- Biobak: Graphics artist who provided input on the Goomba boss fight changes and contributed marketing ideas for YouTube videos (suggested titles like "the secret reason I've been rewriting mario 64" and "the zelda game nintendo tried to hide from you")
- Zeina: Animator working on various animations for the project. Kaze mentions: "I'm going to write Zayna the animations we need. And then I'm going to close this and send Zayna the newest file."
- Other Contributors: 
  - Zell: Working on "missing link version updates" - Kaze mentions "I'm just gonna pay him to do it"
  - Fast64 tool developers: Mentioned as the tool used for Blender exports

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Goomba boss fight redesign: "You want the Goomba to pick a place. He just walks there. And then the boulder follows Mario. Not the other way around. So you have to aim the boulder at him."
- Animation synchronization issues: "I don't like how this doesn't sync to the animation. Looks very poopy."
- Bloom effect experimentation: Attempted but deemed too expensive - "The guy that made this set, it cost him 7 milliseconds of RDP time"
- N64 compatibility as priority: Multiple fixes implemented for N64 hardware, including lights and crash fixes
- Boss doors implementation: "And the boss doors. That open up when the Goomba is angry."

## Business Aspects
- YouTube content strategy: "My video plan. Hopefully this Saturday, the BLJ video. Then hopefully two to three weeks after that is a video just gonna be titled like so about that N64 game I've been working on"
- Marketing approach: Discussion with Biobak about video titles - switching from basic titles to more clickbait-style ones like "the secret reason I've been rewriting mario 64"
- View predictions: "I thought was going to be 80 000 views I think just from the title change alone 300 000"
- Audience education needed: Plans to make a video explaining "hey, my channel I'm not actually trying to make the optimized vanilla Mario 64. I'm making my own game."
- Community perception issues: "no one wants to watch those previews" leading to less progress updates on main channel

## Key Quotes
- "Just be like at your PC and you say I'm not allowed to talk to anyone or get up or do anything until I'm done implementing this feature and then you just do it."
- "I'm starting to get comments from people on my YouTube channel that are like, why are you still talking about Mario 64? You've made enough Mario 64 videos. And it's like, why are you guys watching my channel?"
- "if you want to be successful making video games you need to be mentally unwell. That is 100% the prerequisite. You need to be completely insane."
