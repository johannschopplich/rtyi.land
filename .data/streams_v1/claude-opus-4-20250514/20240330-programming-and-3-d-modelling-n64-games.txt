## Game Development Process
- Currently working on finishing "Grand Sand Badland" (Western-themed level) with a "pretty short list" of remaining tasks
- Main tasks include: implementing swinging saloon doors, adding chain chomp enemy, making train wheels animate, adding smoke/VFX to train, and creating growing bartender hat mechanic
- Development appears to be in late stages for this particular level
- Uses iterative approach with regular streaming/community feedback
- Optimized specifically for real N64 hardware: "Yes, they can be played on real N64s. This one here especially is optimized for it."

## Personal Insights
- On criticism: "I feel like that's kind of like an integrity thing you should do. Always look at criticism very objectively. And unemotionally."
- Against self-inserts in games: "I don't put myself in my games I think self inserts is a little cringe"
- Views on other ROM hacks: "I think that the vast majority of people do not rate [Star Revenge] as highly. It's just our niche community here"
- Shows dedication despite feeling unwell: "God, I felt like shit before the stream started but now I'm feeling fine. I don't know what it is. Maybe I'm just sick when the pressure is on."

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: No specific mentions in this transcript
- Biobak: Actively reworking course 11 with impressive visual improvements - "Biobak had an issue with the combiner, so he sent me an image and he made it look like this. It's crazy. Looks so much better already."
- Zeina: Creating textures for the project - "Zeno's making the textures"
- Other Contributors: 
  - Sauron: Working on RSP optimization - "currently working on making F3DX less RSP intensive in the hopes that it'll work on RTYI"
  - Dan: Appears to be a regular collaborator/voice channel participant
  - Lila: Regular tester/feedback provider, may assist with level editing
  - Scuttlebug Razor: Community member wanting Fast64 PR reviews
  - "shorts guy": Paid $270/year for YouTube shorts creation

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Memory constraints affecting level design: "we kind of have an issue with this level in that we're kind of out of memory. So I don't really want to add new characters if we can prevent that."
- Implemented custom audio pitch system for character voices (specifically for Boshi character)
- Created interactive saloon doors with proper physics/collision
- Designed bartender hat that grows with each star collected as an Easter egg
- Working within N64 hardware limitations while maintaining creative vision
- RSP bottleneck issues: "RTYI is actually RSP bottlenecked"

## Business Aspects
- Pays $270/year for YouTube shorts creation
- Discussed potentially helping Lila acquire better hardware for level editing contributions
- No specific release or marketing plans mentioned

## Key Quotes
- "Every time you program something, you want it to be free of cost. If you're not using that part of codes."
- "I want to implement solutions to my problems" (responding to suggestion about implementing features without clear purpose)
- "We saved free instruction from all that. But not just that, we also have the code to be easier to work with now. Isn't that amazing?"

## Potential Interview Topics
- The collaborative development process and how different contributors (artists, programmers, testers) work together remotely
- Technical challenges and innovations in optimizing for original N64 hardware while adding modern features
- The role of community feedback and live streaming in shaping the game's development
- Design philosophy behind blending classic Mario 64 mechanics with new creative elements
- The significance of small details and Easter eggs (like the growing bartender hat) in creating a unique experience
