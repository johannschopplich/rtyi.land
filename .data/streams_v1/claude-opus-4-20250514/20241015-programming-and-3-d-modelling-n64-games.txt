## Game Development Process
- Course 1 (Bunny Brush Woods) has been completed after multiple reworks: "Either way today actually we're done with course one. Let me update my title Back to c14"
- Currently working on Course 14, which features multiple biomes and different music tracks that fade between areas
- Only one course remains after Course 14: "After this, yes, after this, there's only one course left. That is correct."
- Course 15 is already halfway complete with many assets prepared: "Chris15 is actually already halfway done, because I have a lot of assets already in there."
- The development involves constant iteration and refinement, with willingness to rework levels multiple times for quality

## Personal Insights
- Kaze acknowledges his limitations as a designer: "I'm like a programmer I'm as a designer I'm like 7 out of 10. Right. So just because I say things doesn't mean they're necessarily true"
- Strong belief in iterative improvement: "I know people sometimes give me shit for putting reworks of my level in, but would you rather just have the worst level? I think I much prefer this, to be honest."
- Recognizes the collaborative nature of the project: "It's not just my game, you are helping a lot on it."
- Humorous defiance toward potential legal issues: "Are you scared that Nintendo will attack your project? Nintendo should be scared I attack headquarters."
- Core design philosophy centers on freedom and immersion: "I would say the purpose of almost all the levels is just to let you experience freedom and immersion"

## Collaborator Information
- Badub/Badub: Composed multiple songs for Course 14 that dynamically fade between different areas. Uploads music to SoundCloud quickly. "Oh my god, Badub made so many new songs. This is for the mountainous area."
- Biobak/Biobak: Created new font textures that are less pixelated and have transparent pixels. Also performs level reworks that somehow improve performance while adding content: "every time Biobak reworks the levels, he improves the performance despite adding a shit ton of stuff"
- Zeina/Zeinab: Was asked to create a new icon as the current one is temporary: "I already asked the Zainab to make a new icon by Mike. The current icon is completely temporary"
- Other Contributors: 
  - Big: Created font textures alongside Biobak
  - Lera/Layra: Creating 3D models including paper airplanes and fortune tellers
  - Legion: Provided Grand Star models

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Redesigned bridge texture in Course 1 from stone to wood to better fit the artistic cohesion of Bunny Brush Woods
- Implementing wing cap mechanics in Course 14 to provide contrast between restricted and free movement: "contrast is really what amplifies your feeling and by having a strong contrast between non-free and free parts, the freedom is going to feel more freedom"
- Changed from collecting silver stars with paper airplane to using wing cap and shooting through paper targets
- Performance optimization is a major concern for Course 14 due to expensive visual effects and overdraw issues
- Careful consideration of mission design to avoid pointless collect-a-thons: "Why would someone want to do a mission that's just walk everywhere, idiot?"

## Business Aspects
- No direct mentions of marketing, funding, or release/distribution plans found
- Mentioned potentially creating a "Mr. Beast style" video about hacking every N64 game in one day as promotional content

## Key Quotes
- "I would say the purpose of almost all the levels is just to let you experience freedom and immersion at this point after the first one, which has to also teach you movement."
- "The great thing about the wing cap is that the wing cap now lets you move over the entire level without having to go through the entire platform fuckery, so you're going to feel much more free to just move anywhere."
- "every time Biobak reworks the levels, he improves the performance despite adding a shit ton of stuff. It's just a bubble blower we're thinking of... there's duplicate textures here, or there's textures here that we don't need, or there's a few polygons you missed."

## Potential Interview Topics
- The iterative design philosophy and how many times levels get reworked before completion
- The collaborative process with artists and musicians, particularly how Badub's dynamic music system works
- Technical challenges of optimization for N64 hardware while maintaining ambitious visual effects
- The core design philosophy of freedom and immersion, and how different power-ups serve this goal
- The team's approach to avoiding common ROM hack pitfalls like pointless collect-a-thon missions
