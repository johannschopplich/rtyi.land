## Game Development Process
- Released a public progress tracker spreadsheet showing course completion percentages (Course 1: 100%, Course 2: 90%, Course 3: 100%, Course 4: 25%, etc.)
- Conducted first beta test for Course 4, which "seems the course is on the right track. The testers liked it more than I thought they would"
- Sound engine has been completely remade, allowing for ambient sound effects to be added throughout the game
- Currently working on texture blending and environmental details for volcanic island areas
- Experiencing Fast64 rendering bugs that are blocking some development work

## Personal Insights
- "I feel like I finally have my freedom back. I had so much stuff to do the last couple days, that I couldn't do anything I wanted to do"
- On making YouTube videos: "No, I hate making videos. But it's good money"
- Regarding his YouTube content: "I am kind of perceiving it as nonsense. But it is what does well on YouTube"
- Shows deep appreciation for subtle details: "The little propeller sound makes it feel so much more alive to me. And same with the windmill... It's a thing you perceive, but don't realize you perceive"
- Expresses frustration with constant release date questions from the community

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: Composer who has created sound effects that Kaze is implementing. "I recently started importing some of Badub's sound effects"
- Biobak: Graphics artist whose "rework is just him updating the graphics. That's like 90% of what he does. He does make some gameplay changes, but they are all very simple to accommodate"
- Zeina: Not mentioned in this transcript
- Other Contributors:
  - Vileback: Collaborator helping redesign the plane mission in Course 4
  - Firebike: Will be improving graphics ("They're going to look a lot better once Firebike has gotten his hands on this")
  - Lyska: Involved with PC port discussions

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Course 4 beta test revealed issues: "I kept getting softlocked. And the plane mission sucks. So we need to think of something new"
- Struggling with texture choices for volcanic rock: "So right now you have to decide how active you want the volcano. It could maybe erupt and cover some of the island with lava"
- Fast64 bug preventing proper rendering: "This is a Fast64 bug. They need to fix the program. I can't do much right now"
- Working on creating proper transitions between volcanic and non-volcanic rock textures
- Implementing environmental storytelling through texture choices (volcanic side vs. normal side of island)

## Business Aspects
- Maintains YouTube channel with bi-weekly upload schedule to fund development: "It takes away time from me working on stuff. Like my game. I'd say that's the biggest issue"
- Concerns about ROM bootlegging: "people are going to make bootlegs of my game and sell them. There's actually an entire industry for that. There's probably, I bet my ROMX probably made over a million dollars at this point through rebroad cartridges"
- No set release date: "It's going to release when it's done, basically"
- Next YouTube video planned: "Why the N64 was so blurry"

## Key Quotes
- "Now that the sound engine is completely remade, we can add some sound effects everywhere. And look at this, I love this. It adds so much"
- "I wish I could just say fuck it and only work on my hacks too"
- "People love talking out of their ass about things they don't understand"

## Potential Interview Topics
1. The balance between creative passion and financial necessity - how YouTube content creation funds the game development but takes away from development time
2. The collaborative process and how different team members' contributions (Badub's sound, Biobak's graphics) enhance the overall vision
3. The iterative nature of level design based on beta testing feedback, particularly the Course 4 plane mission redesign
4. Technical limitations and creative solutions - working around Fast64 bugs and N64 hardware constraints
5. Community management and dealing with constant pressure for release dates while maintaining quality standards
