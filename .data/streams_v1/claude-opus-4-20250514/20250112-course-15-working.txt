## Game Development Process
- Currently working on Course 15, a space-themed level with a factory setting
- Already released a demo featuring Course 1-1 to gather feedback on Mario's physics and camera system: "The purpose of the demo is to get feedback on Mario's physics and the camera"
- Boss fight planning is the next major development milestone: "the boss fight is basically the thing we have to like do next or plan out next so that's why the factory is there"
- Game is built on Mario 64 decompilation and targets 30 FPS performance
- Using RAM expansion pack for the game: "this game needs a ram expansion... I am too lazy to make it work without it"

## Personal Insights
- Concerned about his second channel becoming too popular: "i'm a little scared that there's too many people watching my second channel because it's just like me posting whatever the fuck i feel like and there's like no editing or anything it's like too private for the public"
- Strong stance against PC port expectations: "People have been so insistent and annoying about the PC port. That at this point, out of pure stubbornness, I want nothing to do with it"
- Committed to creating an authentic N64 experience: "I just want to make a cool N64 game"
- Values maintaining consistent Mario physics: "one important ground rule for this is that most of the time you will stay mario end up with the same physics that's important for me"
- Found the demo survey valuable: "the feedback i got on the survey was also very useful i think making the survey was like a banger idea"

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: Composer (mentioned but not actively discussed in this stream)
- Biobak: Graphics artist who has been collaborating on boss fight concepts, sent ideas for a mutated Yoshi design: "Biobak did draw something here but he sent me this idea here before"
- Zeina: Animator (not mentioned in this transcript)
- Other Contributors:
  - Dario: Created an impressive reflection effect that Kaze is trying to replicate: "Dario made such a nice version of this. That's like way better"
  - Easy/EZA: Provided texture assistance during the stream: "Let's see what you got for me easy. I Sent it to isolation funny square brick"
  - Alox: Potentially working on X-coop features: "I'm not doing anything with X-Corp, but Alox said he might wanna do it"

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Struggling to create convincing reflection effects on space buildings without environment mapping: "i'm trying to make this look somewhat reflective without actually using an env map because if i use an env map i can't use a texture"
- Boss fight design evolved to feature a mutated Yoshi that players heal rather than kill: "what if you just destroy the tumors and that like makes him happy and he's like wow, thanks for helping me"
- Space level populated by "Sky Guys" (not Shy Guys) who are frightened of the mutated Yoshi boss
- Implemented power-ups include ice cap, wing cap, cloud cap, and bomb cap
- Boss arena designed with hexagonal platform pattern for strategic movement
- Baby Yoshis will serve as enemies that players heal by destroying their growths

## Business Aspects
- Acknowledges potential financial benefits of PC port but prioritizes creative vision: "I would probably make a good amount of money if I used the PC part for my stuff. I don't think it really matters what I do. But it's not, like, ironic for the money anyway"
- No specific release or distribution plans mentioned
- Demo release was strategic for feedback gathering rather than marketing

## Key Quotes
- "one important ground rule for this is that most of the time you will stay mario end up with the same physics that's important for me"
- "what if you just destroy the tumors and that like makes him happy and he's like wow, thanks for helping me Sorry, I was in such a bad mood that I attacked you"
- "People have been so insistent and annoying about the PC port. That at this point, out of pure stubbornness, I want nothing to do with it. Even if I could see a use case for it, I would be like, no."
