## Game Development Process
- Currently in late development stages: "So I'm mostly finished UV mapping this area here"
- Near completion of main content: "we're almost done with course 14 and course 15 is also already halfway done then it's all courses done and then we just need three more side levels and three overall parts"
- Clear timeline for completion: "I feel like we're definitely gonna finish all the main content in 2025 and then we have a lot of time to polish the game"
- Multiple courses already reworked: "what's gotten reworked is course one course three course four course five um I think there's more course 11 for sure"
- Currently working on Course 14 final touches and Course 15 development

## Personal Insights
- Strong opinions on game design philosophy: "I think golden[eye] is a terrible concept... when you make Game you need to be aware of the restrictions you have and aiming with a stick fucking sucks"
- Personal gaming history influences design: "I grew up on pal ocarina of time 2 in 16fps it was a prime there has to be some kind of cruelty law against making children play ocarina of time in 16fps"
- Collaborative content creation: "I scripted a banger video with the Mario 64 GBA guy We're gonna make a video about that"
- Pride in optimization work: Discussion about ROM hacks not actually needing expansion packs, just being "programmed lazily"

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: No direct mentions in this transcript
- Biobak: Handles visual polish and color work - "this is what we're gonna send off to Biobak And he was gonna make the colors pretty and everything"
- Zeina: Working on specific level areas - "ice castle's not done either though there's still the outside area that Zeina wanted to work on"
- Other Contributors: 
  - Mario 64 GBA developer (collaboration on video content)
  - Yuki (mentioned as providing "cardboard Donkey Kong and cardboard peach")

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Camera management as major consideration: "The area needed to be bigger for the sake of the camera That's one issue I hate in Mario 64 when that happens"
- Difficulty balancing: "You can no longer do the triple jump thing here" - removing unintended shortcuts
- Retro section implementation challenges: Extensive discussion about implementing a Mario Paint-themed section, considering various approaches
- Level naming process: Collaborative discussion settling on "Forgotten Fortress" for the ice castle level
- Technical optimization: Discussion about expansion pack requirements being unnecessary with proper memory management

## Business Aspects
- Sponsorship income: "So I got an email today and that said that I'd play roblox for two hours they will pay me $135... That's like almost $70 an hour to play roblox"
- Additional sponsorship perks: "I can spend I think $10 on here and they will give me the money back... spend ten to six dollars in game. I get reimbursed plus an additional $30"

## Key Quotes
- "when you make Game you need to be aware of the restrictions you have and aiming with a stick fucking sucks so that's a restriction you need to keep in mind"
- "I feel like we're definitely gonna finish all the main content in 2025 and then we have a lot of time to polish the game"
- "The reason romex used the expansion pack is convenience For the older tools, it was just easier to be like, all right instead of properly managing my memory I'm just gonna use the expansion pack"

## Potential Interview Topics
1. The collaborative process with Biobak and Zeina - how does the division of labor work and how do they communicate creative vision?
2. The philosophy behind integrating retro Mario game sections and how they choose which games to reference
3. The technical optimization journey - moving from "lazy" expansion pack requirements to efficient memory management
4. The influence of personal gaming experiences (like PAL Ocarina of Time) on design decisions
5. The balance between maintaining difficulty while ensuring accessibility and preventing frustrating camera issues
