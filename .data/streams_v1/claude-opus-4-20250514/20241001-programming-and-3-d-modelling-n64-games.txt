## Game Development Process
- Currently working on Course 14, implementing a rework of Course 1 (Course 1) completed by Biobak
- Preparing for a demo release that will contain just one stage
- ROM size is currently around 63 MB, approaching the self-imposed 64 MB limit for authenticity
- Regular testing on actual N64 hardware, achieving "nearly 60 FPS"
- Iterative process of importing, testing, and optimizing Biobak's model reworks
- Performance optimization is a continuous focus throughout development

## Personal Insights
- Believes the project is "already the prettiest N64 game there is" and challenges anyone to argue otherwise
- Strong stance on ROM size authenticity: "if you go over 64 MB, are you really still making an N64 game? ... it's kind of lame, right? It's like you're going beyond what they were able to do at the time"
- Views streaming as minimal effort: "I just stream because I want to stream and because I like having people be able to give me feedback... I'm not trying to be like a professional streamer"
- Expresses frustration with technical challenges but shows pride in overcoming them
- Considering creating an analysis series about "why every individual course is worth playing" in Return to Yoshi's Island

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: Composer who has created "a bunch of new music" including biome-specific versions that smoothly fade between sections. Created music for the pyramids area and grass area
- Biobak: 3D artist responsible for Course 1 rework and numerous model updates including Goombas, Yoshi egg, bouncy flowers, windmill, and various enemy designs. Works in Blender and doesn't test directly on N64 hardware
- Zeina: No information found in this transcript
- Other Contributors: No additional contributors mentioned beyond general chat participants providing feedback

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Implemented soft body physics for Mario's nose using a custom physics bone system: "It's actual rigid body physics, or soft body physics"
- Added dynamic sun rotation effects based on camera movement for enhanced visual appeal
- Reworking enemy models to reduce materials and improve performance (e.g., Goomba King "saved free materials")
- Implementing infinitely far backgrounds instead of nearby geometry per Biobak's request
- Planning changes to Goomba boss fight mechanics
- Balancing visual improvements with N64 hardware limitations and render order challenges
- Castle doors will be animated and "only open when the Goomba King leaves"

## Business Aspects
- "Modding makes me some amount of money through YouTube and Patreon... But it's not even half of what my normal job makes"
- Demo release planned containing one stage only
- Considering creating video series on second channel to analyze game design
- No specific marketing or distribution plans mentioned

## Key Quotes
- "I think I'm pretty sure this already is the prettiest N64 game there is. I don't think you can really make an argument against that."
- "But if you go over 64 MB, are you really still making an N64 game? I mean, you could argue you're making an N64 game because it runs on N64. But at the same time, it's kind of lame, right? It's like you're going beyond what they were able to do at the time."
- "Think about it, in a 33.3 MS frame, we have 24.3 idle time. That's 73% idle. The CPU is not working two thirds of the time."

## Potential Interview Topics
1. The philosophy behind maintaining N64 authenticity while pushing technical boundaries - particularly the 64MB ROM size limitation and what it means to create a "true" N64 game
2. The collaborative process with Biobak and how artistic vision is balanced with technical constraints when the artist doesn't test on hardware
3. The implementation of innovative features like Mario's nose physics and how these small details contribute to the overall game feel
4. The role of community feedback through streaming in shaping development decisions
5. Future plans for the project beyond the demo release and how the game design analysis series might influence development
