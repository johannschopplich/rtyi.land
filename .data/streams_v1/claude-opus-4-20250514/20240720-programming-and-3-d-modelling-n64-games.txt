## Game Development Process
- Currently developing course 13 (ice/snow themed level) out of what appears to be 15+ total courses
- Implementing a new profiler tool created by team member Sauron to optimize performance
- Game now runs at approximately 30 FPS after recent optimizations ("Dang, I think we can get oily, boily bay at 30 FPS now")
- Memory optimization work resulted in gaining 400 microseconds of computing time
- Active asset implementation phase with multiple character models being updated
- Using Fast64 plugin for Blender in the development pipeline

## Personal Insights
- Kaze is expecting his first child (daughter named Reyna) who was due 2 days before the stream
- Currently on 2 months of paternity leave, which he's using to work on N64 optimization: "Dude, I'm still on two months of paternity leave. I'm gonna spend that time trying to optimize the operating system on my N64"
- Frustrated with Germany's bureaucracy and outdated technology: "living in germany sucks i'm so glad i moved out"
- Takes pride in optimization work and finds the new profiler "amazing" for development
- Balances family life with development: mentions "20 minutes of work then 20 minutes of family time then 20 hours of super mario 64 level making"

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: No specific mentions in this transcript
- Biobak: Graphics artist actively sending updated assets including Wamp models, Koopa workers, Wiggler faces, and glass textures. Left detailed notes about optimizations: "Goal new design and one fewer material. That is the notes that Biobak left us"
- Zeina: Mentioned as Kaze's partner and mother of his child, also referenced in context of animations work
- Other Contributors: 
  - Sauron: Developer who created the new profiler tool
  - Unnamed video editor: "Dude, I have a video editor now, I think, and he's making the next video and it's looking clean"

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Course 13 features ice caves with snowman dodging sections inspired by Jolly Roger Bay's ship climbing mechanic
- Increased control precision from 4096 to 65536 angles: "In Mario 64 you have 4096 angles. In this game you have 65336 angles. The controls are about 8 times more precise"
- Memory allocation challenges with collision triangles: "every time you have a collision triangle that crosses into multiple cells and there are 64 cells each way you have to allocate two surface nodes"
- Material optimization focus to improve performance (reducing from 8 to 4 materials on some models)
- Implementing fog effects for better visual cohesion
- Balancing difficulty in slide sections by adjusting camera angles

## Business Aspects
- Has hired a video editor for promotional content production
- No specific mentions of release dates, funding, or distribution plans found

## Key Quotes
- "When I first made this slide I ran out of memory. And because of that I did the whole memory allocation thing that I talked about earlier in my Case Clips video today. And because of that we gained 400 microseconds of computing time."
- "For just so few people making a whole game. I think RTVI is being made in pretty reasonable amount of time. When you consider everything around it."
- "Funny thing about RTYI, 25 out of 33 milliseconds are spent on a while 1 loop. It's all idle. It's around 76% of the entire game, it's just the game doing nothing at all."

## Potential Interview Topics
1. The role of technical optimization in creative game design - how memory limitations led to innovative solutions
2. Building and managing a remote collaborative team for ROM hack development
3. Balancing parenthood with passion projects - development during paternity leave
4. The evolution from ROM hacking to full game development using decompilation
5. The importance of custom tools (like Sauron's profiler) in pushing N64 hardware limits
