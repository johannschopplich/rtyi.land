## Game Development Process
- Currently working on Course 10 (C10) rework with significant asset changes from collaborator Biobak
- Major milestone achieved: "I am slowly approaching zero engine bugs I actually got my entire compiler down to zero warnings as well"
- Iterative development process shown through real-time bug fixing and testing during stream
- Focus on optimization: "actors execute their code in order of what they're named in the level so I made it so that all actors of the same code have like similar names and that makes it so that we get a little bit of better cache proximity"
- Development involves constant importing, testing, and refining of assets

## Personal Insights
- Strong pride in visual achievements: "do you see the water Lila? do you see this 55fps with empty aliasing? I don't think you can even make the case that there's a better looking N64 game than this like anywhere in the world"
- Confidence in debugging abilities: "I have never in my life broken something without being able to figure out what I broke. So I wouldn't know. I'm very good at just remembering my code"
- Perfectionist approach to details: "I see a minor UV mapping error here. Uh-oh. Problem is, I actually care enough to fix it"
- Values efficiency over following conventional practices: "I only know as much C as I need to know to manipulate the compiler to get me the assembly instructions I need"

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: No relevant information found in this transcript
- Biobak: Sent comprehensive changelog with actor changes for Course 10 rework; created new Yoshi model; responsible for various visual assets including plants and level geometry
- Zeina: Mentioned humorously as having "banished [Kaze] to the basement"; involved in animations based on previous mentions
- Other Contributors: Active community members in chat providing real-time feedback on visual elements and design decisions

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Implemented vertex color technique for efficient lighting: "If you look at something like Majora's Mask or any of the rare games, you should see it all over the place. Because it is a very efficient technique"
- Dealing with texture limitations: "material 242 has too many colors again? we literally fixed this yesterday"
- Strategic actor ordering for cache optimization to improve performance
- Balancing visual quality with N64 hardware constraints
- Collision map creation required due to significant level geometry changes
- Animation rigging challenges with Yoshi model requiring multiple iterations

## Business Aspects
- Launched new merchandise store on TeePublic: "we now have a new merch store on TeePublic... they have much cheaper prices than Spreadshirt"
- Planning course-themed shirt designs: "we are going to make a design for every course with the course icon from the final game"
- F3 2025 event announcement: "since this is a sponsored event this time, we can hold a user vote. And the most popular game gets a cash reward on the day they release their game"

## Key Quotes
- "I am slowly approaching zero engine bugs I actually got my entire compiler down to zero warnings as well"
- "I don't think you can even make the case that there's a better looking N64 game than this like anywhere in the world"
- "Hash management is really not that complicated and people that tell you not to deal with cache blocks are evil"

## Potential Interview Topics
1. The evolution from solo development to collaborative workflow - how has working with Biobak, Zeina, and others changed the development process?
2. Technical innovations in N64 optimization - what specific breakthroughs have enabled the visual quality achieved in Return to Yoshi's Island?
3. The balance between perfectionism and pragmatism - how do you decide when a detail is worth fixing versus moving forward?
4. Community engagement and monetization strategies - how do merchandise and events like F3 2025 support the project's sustainability?
5. The artistic vision for Return to Yoshi's Island - what drives the decision to push N64 graphics to their limits rather than accepting traditional constraints?
