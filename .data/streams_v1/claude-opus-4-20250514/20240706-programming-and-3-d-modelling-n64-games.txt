## Game Development Process
- Currently in bug fixing and optimization phase: "I was working on a bunch of small bug fixes. And on importing Sauraen's trace."
- N64 hardware testing showing promising results: "Did you guys like the N64 test I did today? It ran a lot better than I thought it would. It ran near perfect without even optimizing anything. It's not optimized at all yet, so of course we're going to optimize it a little more."
- Implemented new test overworld for easier level testing: "Oh yeah, I made a new test overworld, by the way. The official RTY overworld is reduced to nothing again. So now when we exit the level we just get to the test overworld, but this is important for testing."
- Working on anti-aliasing options as offline project: "Actually, my offline project right now is programming the anti-aliasing options. So once we have that in, we finally have a toggleable anti-aliasing"

## Personal Insights
- Major life event approaching: "Can you guys believe it's just two weeks until my child is born"
- Future plans after RTY: "When I finish this, what are you going to do next? Are you going to print something else? I'm probably going to make my own game at that point."
- Creative vision for level naming: "this is gonna sound like an insane man speak but I want I want a name that is sharp you know what I mean it's a minty name... I want a name that feels minty"
- On his development approach: "I have a bunch of time off from work, so I'm going to work on a bunch of features that I have put off for a long time."

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: No relevant information found in this stream
- Biobak: Active in chat, contributing design suggestions (mentioned suggesting "piss carpet" idea)
- Zeina: Now has her own office after moving, watches shows with Kaze, was involved in their wedding planning
- Other Contributors: 
  - Sauraen: Working on optimization tool called "Sauraen's trace" - "Once Sauraen's trace is in, it's going to be a lot easier to program. It's going to make optimization so much easier, actually. We'll probably find so many stupid things going on in the game that will give us huge boosts."

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Designing snowman enemies with specific behaviors: "There's going to be kind of like two balls here. And they're going to look at you like this, and then they're going to roll their head at you."
- Level design philosophy for ice castle: "This room here is kind of an example of what I want this level to look like with like walls like this That look like ice is growing on it"
- Puzzle design involving pushing snowman: "There's a snowman here and you push it and it falls Into this window and there's a star behind it"
- Camera and movement refinement: "And some of the levels look truly fucked up. Like the camera here, I don't like it at all. And then the lava doesn't have the render distance. Dude, but the movement here is so good. This is like my favorite level to just run through."
- Working on room system implementation: "I haven't programmed the room system yet, but that's how it's gonna work"

## Business Aspects
- Current income streams: "I have a real job outside of YouTube, where I earn most of my money. But also on YouTube, I make around, from AdSense, I make around like $5,000 a year. So it's not nothing. And then there's a bit of Patreon income as well, which is a lot more than my AdSense."
- No specific RTY release or distribution plans mentioned

## Key Quotes
- "It ran near perfect without even optimizing anything. It's not optimized at all yet, so of course we're going to optimize it a little more." - Shows confidence in N64 compatibility
- "Most of my time here was spent actually making stuff not running stuff" - On his development experience
- "I'm probably going to make my own game at that point." - Future aspirations after RTY

## Potential Interview Topics
