## Game Development Process
- Project has been in development for "almost three years" with the team being "only two-thirds through the game"
- Currently has "115 stars done" as a major milestone
- Entering a polishing phase: "we're gonna do a little polishing face on return to Yoshi's Island where we're just gonna polish up a bunch of old things"
- Estimated completion timeline: "realistically it's still gonna be at least like a year and a half tomorrow"
- Development happens alongside Kaze's full-time job as a programmer at Gears for Breakfast

## Personal Insights
- On motivation: "how do you stay motivated i'm not motivated at all so you need to work without motivation... you're physically capable of working so why aren't you that's how i approach it"
- On game design philosophy (regarding Pikmin 2): "You have no freedom. You're basically just like a worker drone. You're not actually playing a game. You're just doing what you're being told"
- On Nintendo legal concerns: "I'm not really that worried about Nintendo anymore... Last time they took me down, I told them to fuck off, basically, and they did fuck off"
- On preserving Mario 64's core: "it's very tempting to... use our custom coding instead of the Mario moveset and I think that often leads to poor romex So I want to avoid that"

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: Composer (mentioned but not actively participating in this stream)
- Biobak: Graphics artist actively participating in stream, suggesting design elements like "Putting horns on the building" and contributing to boss fight mechanics
- Zeina: Animator working on "Bowser's animations" and NPCs like "buzzy beetles" with "walk animation and they're going to shell animation"
- Laura/Lila: Kaze's wife/partner who helps during streams and with development tasks, appears to manage some animation files

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Designing oil block boss with innovative soap mechanic: "you have to drive around on him to like clean him up"
- Addressing level size concerns: "the problem I have here is that I don't want the level to be miniscule"
- Implementing smart camera collision: "if this is inside level geometry like this path here... it's not gonna block the camera right so only outside level geometry is gonna block the camera"
- Bowser's Magic Show easter egg: "if you do a specific thing you can enter Bowser's magic show and Bowser just sounds like a bunch of really bad jokes"
- Balancing performance with detail: "The issue is this area is gonna have performance problems if we put too much here"

## Business Aspects
- Revenue model: "How do you make money from this? YouTube ads. Ad revenue on YouTube, basically. That's the only thing you can do"
- Open source plans: "This is gonna be open source, of course. I Will open sources once it is released but not before because I would just be leaking my entire mod"
- Speedrunning considerations: "the physics are so different that you're going to unlearn your normal Mario 64 muscle memory"
- Started as hobby, evolved into business: "It started purely as a hobby, but it slowly turned into, like, business because I started making money from it"

## Key Quotes
- "at some point when you have so much money at your disposal you don't become you cease to become human anymore you are just an entity that exists with too much money" (On Elon Musk and wealth)
- "I do have a full-time job so I can't spend that much time on it I'm trying to get it done in a timely manner but we are only two-thirds through the game and it's been like almost three years now"
- "Combat in Mario 64 is not easy because like his punches can a suck We need to think of a way to beat them like through the environment"
