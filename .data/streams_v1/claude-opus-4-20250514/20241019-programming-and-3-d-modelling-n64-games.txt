## Game Development Process
- The demo is complete with all N64 bugs fixed: "The demo is all done, by the way. I fixed all the N64 bugs. I can show you real quick."
- Currently working on Course 14 (referred to as C14), which features various biomes including desert, mountains, castle, and grasslands
- Implemented paper airplane physics for a target practice mission where players break targets with Mario's face
- Added anti-aliasing options that significantly improve frame rates: "You turn it off, you almost get 50 FPS here"
- Plans to create analysis videos for every course before the remix exists: "The reason I'm going to do it for every course is because I want to have the videos done before the remix exists"

## Personal Insights
- Kaze expresses frustration with chat interruptions during complex programming: "Okay, guys, you are asking way too many questions about the feature that's not even done yet that I just started programming on"
- Shows dedication to time efficiency: "we care about time efficiency here"
- Reveals his age consciousness: "I'm gonna turn old. I'm not 30 yet, so I'm still alive and young, but soon"
- Demonstrates perfectionism: "We want it to move like a real paper plane. We want it to go swoop, swoop, you know what I mean?"
- Plans to transition to original game development: "Yes, I will make my own game... Most likely [in Unreal Engine 5]"

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: No relevant information found
- Biobak: No relevant information found
- Zeina: Brief mention - "Hello Zena, what are you doing? We just did the paper airplane"
- Other Contributors: "I'm not the animator for this game anyway" - implies there's a dedicated animator (possibly Zeina) working on the project

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Implementing realistic paper plane physics with complex calculations for pitch, velocity, and rotation
- Addressing N64-specific rendering issues: "There used to be a line through that. That's because of some coverage multiplied by alpha thing"
- Balancing performance with visual quality through anti-aliasing options
- Working within Fast64's limitations: "The problem is Fast64 currently only supports two mid-map levels"
- Creating mechanical-sounding dialogue for NPCs: "I want them to be kind of mechanical"
- Dealing with widescreen stretching issues: "The game runs in like stretched 16 to 9, which causes that to happen"

## Business Aspects
- Seeking early access to Analogue 3D for review purposes: "I'm hoping to get my hands on like an early copy so I can do a proper review"
- YouTube content strategy includes technical videos and shorts: "My current YouTube plan is next video is going to be a video explaining how the VLJ works"
- Using main social media account for marketing: "I feel like I do all my marketing over my main account"
- Considering separate social media for future commercial game: "I feel like if we do a real game, that's where we should make a separate social media account"
- Views on 3D platformer market: "I think the bar for 3D platformers is so incredibly low that making a 3D platformer is easy at this point"

## Key Quotes
- "I think the bar for 3D platformers is so incredibly low that making a 3D platformer is easy at this point... if you just make a hack or make a game that doesn't suck, I think it's going to be popular."
- "I've always been a hater for people that are like, oh, I can't work on my R64 because I have school. Bitch, school is like six hours a day. You still are awake for 10 hours a day beyond that."
- "The saddest thing about the Game Freak leaks is that Pokemon fans are gonna make the Typhlosion joke for the next 5 years"

## Potential Interview Topics
1. The technical challenges of optimizing a ROM hack for N64 hardware while maintaining visual quality - exploring the balance between performance and aesthetics
2. The transition from ROM hacking to original game development - what skills transfer and what new challenges emerge
3. The role of community feedback during live development streams - how does real-time interaction affect the creative process?
4. Team dynamics and collaboration in a distributed ROM hacking project - how work is divided and coordinated
5. The philosophy behind creating "Return to Yoshi's Island" - what makes a good spiritual successor versus a simple remake?
