## Game Development Process
- The game is nearing completion, with Course 14 (Handmade Heights) essentially finished: "Course 14 is done. All that's missing is one asset, which I'm still waiting for from Yuki."
- Currently working on Course 15 (Astral Arcade), which appears to be one of the final levels
- ROM size is at 58 megabytes out of a self-imposed 64 megabyte limit: "62 megabytes. And we still have these four songs to delete... 58 megabytes. Oh, easy. We have so much space left and all the stream songs are in now."
- The game has "three times as much text as Mario 64" already implemented
- Using the N64 expansion pack for development convenience: "Mostly I use it to make development easier. If I just say fuck it, I'm not even gonna try to stay in four megabytes of RAM."

## Personal Insights
- Strong commitment to authentic N64 development constraints: "I want to stick to the 64 megabyte limit because that's what they worked with back in a day. So I'm going over that would feel like cheating"
- Clear game design philosophy against minigame overload: "I don't want this game to turn into W64 where it's like, oh you like 3D platformers? Fuck you. Here's Pac-Man. Go beat Pac-Man."
- Ethical stance against gambling mechanics: "I'm a bit worried that any of these are actually like gambling. I want them to be games and not gambling. That's kind of important to me."
- Memory of previous projects is hazy due to stress: "To me, the anxiety of working on 64 Land is a blur in my memory. I don't remember that I made that game. It's like someone else took position of my body and made it."

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: Composed music for Course 15 (Astral Arcade), provides pre-rendered songs with loop points. Kaze notes: "I love working with a song already made for the level because it gives me so many ideas for the vibe."
- Biobak: No direct mentions in this transcript
- Zeina: No direct mentions in this transcript (though someone named Zayna is greeted at the beginning)
- Other Contributors:
  - Laira: Created the Peach artwork being implemented: "It's an adorable peach drawing. Yeah, Laira made it."
  - Yuki: Responsible for animating Peach character: "Yuki wanted to do the drawing so I'm waiting for that."
  - Holly: Assisted with finding music loop points during the stream
  - Eiza: Previously collaborated on creating assets for the arcade level

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Course 15 (Astral Arcade) design: "I'm thinking we mark specific low gravity places instead of doing it the other way around. Because playing with gravity is a very fun concept for a level"
- Innovative mechanic where arcade games affect the level: "You enter the arcade you do the game and then the moon outside the arcade exploded and then you go back out"
- Avoiding repetitive level design: "Wouldn't this be a lot of repeat walking the same path? I'm a bit worried about that."
- Integration of pinball elements as platforming: "Instead of there being a thing to slide on. It's just gonna be the bumpers and the flippers. It's not actually gonna be a pinball game. Just like pinball elements. To use as platforms to get around."
- Star naming conventions being carefully considered for each level

## Business Aspects
- Pursuing Twitter monetization: "Fellas, we are so close to getting monetized on Twitter. It's crazy how easy it actually was to get monetized on Twitter as soon as we started trying."
- Planning demo release: "The Barney Rushford's demo hopefully comes out soon... hopefully that's by the end of the year it's out. But no guarantee."
- Two more videos planned before demo release, suggesting a content marketing strategy

## Key Quotes
- "It's also kind of nice to have some real limits because otherwise it's like Otherwise I feel like I can just like keep adding more and more and I do want to be done eventually"
- "I love working with a song already made for the level because it gives me so many ideas for the vibe."
- "Imagine like an arcade machine sit down the camera just focuses on it and like a cutscene and now you control Star Fox 64 In a really really small version of Star Fox 64"
