## Game Development Process
- The game is in late stages of development: "do you guys actually realize how crazy it is how close we're done to being done like only three levels are missing and i already finished one area of that that's like end game but it's still gonna take a long time but still it's like it's the last fifth of the game"
- Total scope includes approximately 180 stars with 120-130 being main content: "each level has seven stages and you have to complete them all and the total game is gonna have around 180 stars something like that so but only 120 of those are gonna actually maybe like 130 of those are gonna be real content"
- Active N64 hardware optimization: "I made sure it all works on N64 now. I think we should be able to just run around in the game now without crashes" with mentions of achieving 40 FPS before optimization
- Working on two secret areas/levels off-stream that cannot be shown due to collaboration agreement

## Personal Insights
- Strong stance against paid exclusives: "I'm not making any Patreon exclusives. I don't want people to even think I'm trying to bait people into my Patreon."
- Frustration with Nintendo's impact on his career: "I feel like without Nintendo's interference, I would have a million subs by now. No exaggeration. Maybe not a million. Maybe like 800,000."
- Philosophy on game completion: "it's the last fifth of the game that feels like end stretch to me it's gonna take months but still i'm pretty happy about that"
- Preference for hardware-first development: "I don't optimize for emulator at all. I just do for hardware and then the emulator is hopefully good enough to play my ROMACC."

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: No relevant information found in this transcript
- Biobak: Works as a graphics polish artist - "I don't do all the models by myself. I mean, this one here is all by myself, but usually after I'm done, we got Biobak looking over it and he makes them a lot better."
- Zeina: Animator who was unavailable during this stream - "Can you believe Zeyna's on babysitting instead of making games with me right now?"
- Other Contributors: 
  - UED: Provided a gun model for the project
  - Unnamed ROM hacker: Collaborating on a secret project that cannot be shown
  - Leela: Appears to be working on quaternion implementations

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Implementing a reaction-based duel minigame with Boshi: "i was thinking you can have multiple attempts i am going to make it so that the first attempt is really difficult i'm thinking like 280 millisecond reaction time and then every time you lose you get like three frames more reaction time"
- Anti-savestate system featuring rapping Yoshis: "the game detects save states. So if you save state in the game, a space-time Yoshi appears and tells you not to save state. And he will rap at you."
- Focus on display lag compensation: "will the gun minigame take into account modern display like yes who do you think i am you think i'm a fucking scrub you think i don't know that the top human reaction time still something they do is like 210 milliseconds and then the console itself also it's like 80 milliseconds of input lag"
- Optimization challenges with overworld crashes and performance targets

## Business Aspects
- Tentative release window: "i think release before 2026 maybe oh probably actually i don't want to guarantee anything"
- Plans for post-project Kickstarter: "i'm gonna bundle it together with the ad for my kickstarter for the game i'm gonna make after i'm done with return to yoshi's islands"
- Strategic release timing concerns: "the one thing that i'm worried about releasing is that maybe nintendo releases a game around the same time as me and if you release your romhack around the same time as a big nintendo game comes out you are going to get taken down 100%"
- History of Nintendo takedowns affecting previous projects (The Missing Link, Last Impact, Net64)

## Key Quotes
- "Well, basically everything I'm going to release is going to use my engine."
- "I also found some cool random optimizations all over the place."
- "Had Nintendo not interfered, I would have made a lot more videos."

## Potential Interview Topics
1. The development and evolution of the custom engine - its capabilities, optimizations, and future applications
2. The impact of Nintendo's copyright enforcement on ROM hacking culture and how it has shaped development decisions
3. The collaborative process with artists like Biobak and Zeina - how does remote collaboration work in ROM hack development?
4. The technical challenges of N64 hardware optimization and achieving stable performance
5. The creative process behind unique features like the anti-savestate system and how humor is integrated into game design
