## Game Development Process
- Currently on level 11 (Bowser's oil rig), with approximately 11 levels completed total
- "We're actually just in the end game now for the mod. It didn't feel like it took that long at all to me. Maybe it did to you guys."
- Plans to potentially work on multiplayer during two weeks of vacation in late June: "And in those two weeks, I might add multiplayer. With split-screen."
- Release timeline uncertain: "Can you maybe release the game this year? Yeah, it's difficult to release it this year because we're only at close 11. I don't have that much time to work on this."
- Remaining levels include: comic book world, wild west world ("where you solve puzzles and are like a cowboy"), and casino world

## Personal Insights
- Design philosophy on player agency: "I think games should be about experiencing freedom. Am I giving you the line to move along? You don't have any freedom. You're just kind of following instructions."
- Against excessive player options: "See, I'm kind of against giving players options. I think it's weird to give the player an option to like select how the fundamental thing like that works."
- Pragmatic development approach: "I never test my code. I just assume it works. And it saves me a lot of time. And usually it does."
- Moved from Twitch to YouTube streaming: "The reason I don't want to stream on Twitch anymore is that I find it personally unwatchable with all the ads."
- Reflections on video reception: "At first, the comments I got on it were really painful to read, but it turned out a lot better in the end."

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: Composer who created the custom OST, including "Koopa's Revenge 2 OST" and various Mario remixes. All music is custom-made by Badub.
- Biobak: Graphics artist who contributed to visual design decisions, specifically mentioned as suggesting the red color scheme for certain elements.
- Zeina: Animator working on character animations, specifically showcased a Bowser walk cycle during the stream. Lives with Kaze and occasionally appears on stream.
- Other Contributors:
  - Leela/Lila: Working on quaternion animations and exporter tools, has compiled a large texture library (mentioned having 16,500-32,000 textures)
  - Nata: Created the HD Worms Fortress (Kaze only did fixes that took a few hours)

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Implemented new lighting system: "I added the light coming from the camera back. So now all the moving objects are kind of colored in by the camera... which makes the whole game look a lot brighter."
- Designing complex platforming mechanics for oil rig level including moving platforms, ziplines, and cannons
- Color palette challenges: Struggled with making the oil rig level visually appealing without it looking like lava or being too gloomy
- Fixed regression bug with ziplines that broke their functionality
- Design principle of accounting for all player types: "People are going to play your game. And if people are stupid, then you have to account for stupid people playing your game."

## Business Aspects
- Recent video performance: "Oh shit, this video is shaping up to be a banger... It's not doing as well as the fucking grass, I say. The grass video did better."
- Algorithm optimization attempts: "It's actually 38 improvements. I just said 37, because I thought someone would notice and comment on that for the algorithm."
- Plans to open source optimizations: "I'm gonna open source it and I might backport all my optimizations to the vanilla game. No 100% guarantee though."
- No paid features or crowdfunding mentioned; development appears self-funded
- Streaming schedule: Once per week on YouTube, with potential daily streams during vacation period

## Key Quotes
- "I want to release the game when it's actually completely finished."
- "If we do want to add multiplayer, let's bring some stump ideas for it as well."
- "This is going to be the most platformy level yet. I'm going to be very happy with this. It's beautiful too and it will be goofy."

## Potential Interview Topics
1. The evolution from optimization focus to creative game design - how did working on performance improvements lead to creating a full ROM hack?
2. Collaborative dynamics with remote team members (Badub, Biobak, Leela) versus in-person collaboration with Zeina
3. The philosophy of player freedom versus guided gameplay - how this shapes design decisions
4. The technical challenges of implementing splitscreen multiplayer in a Mario 64 ROM hack
5. The decision to move from Twitch to YouTube and how community engagement affects development
