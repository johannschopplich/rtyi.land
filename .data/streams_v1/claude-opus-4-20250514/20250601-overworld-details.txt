## Game Development Process
- The game is "pretty close to completion at this point" with Craft World "basically done" and Space Civilization World already finished
- Currently working on course 7 and overworld design elements, particularly cave designs with rainbow spiral effects
- Development involves iterative testing of mechanics like balloon popping and roller coaster animations
- Using Blender with Python scripting capabilities for level modeling and export to Mario 64
- There are "some parts left unfinished because we're waiting for Biobak to get to it"

## Personal Insights
- On game bugs: "I imagine had this been caught before the game released, then Nintendo would have patched it out basically" - showing consideration for polish vs. unintended features
- On discussing game design: "If you make a bad game and then talk about your game's design, that always feels super weird to me. It's like, I don't know, making a pile of trash and then justifying why you made trash"
- Expresses satisfaction with progress: "I'm really happy with the cave, actually. It really looks like a miracle cave, doesn't it? Beauty. It sucks you right in."
- Shows exhaustion from development: "I'm feeling pretty exhausted for today and I think I'm gonna call it quits early today"
- Advises newcomers: "I always tell people start with a small mod, make something you can finish in like a month at most"

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: No relevant information found in this transcript
- Biobak: Mentioned as working on unfinished parts of Craft World; the team is "waiting for Biobak to get to it"
- Zeina: Voice was apparently audible through Kaze's microphone during stream ("You heard Zeina? Did her voice shine through my microphone?")
- Other Contributors:
  - pixelblahblah: "has been making a lot of animations for Mario in this game" including roller coaster animations
  - Lilaa: Asked to create tree textures that fit Yoshi's Island aesthetic; sent reference materials
  - Mad Mario Productions: Mentioned as being "in the game" with apparent in-game representation
  - Saurin: Mentioned as understanding the microcode

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Implementing new mechanics: "You hit the switch and then you go into this and with the A button you can jump with the roller coaster. And you can eject with C"
- Aesthetic consistency challenges: "I don't like the forest at all" and needs colors that are "sweeter to fit into Yoshi's Island"
- Technical optimization: Discussing triangle counts for trees (aiming for 12-18 triangles, rejecting a 55-triangle model)
- Cave design philosophy: "I want some weird rainbow cave spirals going inside here, cause I feel like that fits the vibe of Dino Domain super well. Like it goes magical."
- Texture resolution constraints: "if you want 16 colors then you can do 64 by 64... if you want more than that 32 by 64"

## Business Aspects
- Plans for potential Steam release: "There's a chance I will turn this into a non-Mario game like replace all the mario IP and put it on steam"
- Would include "extra features new character new story just like the same levels and objectives mostly"
- Legal considerations: "It should be legally possible because of the recompilation"
- Marketing angle on optimization: "imagine the promotional power of being like... we actually optimized our game so much. It literally runs on a nintendo 64"
- Previous success mentioned: "this game [Missing Links] was pretty successful, so I feel like I can talk about the game's design without it being weird"

## Key Quotes
- "I'm making this one, let's maybe" - showing uncertainty and iterative approach to development
- "The game is actually like pretty close to completion at this point. And then I will have my freedom" - revealing both progress and personal investment
- "I work in the video game industry. I know why games aren't optimized" - followed by detailed explanation of industry practices

## Potential Interview Topics
- The evolution from ROM hack to potential commercial Steam release and the legal/technical considerations involved
- The collaborative process with multiple artists and how their contributions are integrated into the cohesive Yoshi's Island aesthetic
- Balancing technical optimization for N64 hardware with creative ambitions and modern expectations
- The significance of being "pretty close to completion" and what "freedom" means after finishing this long-term project
- Design philosophy regarding intentional vs. unintentional bugs and features, and how this shapes the final product
