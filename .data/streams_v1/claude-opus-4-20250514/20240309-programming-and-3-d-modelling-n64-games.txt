## Game Development Process
- Currently working on course 12 out of 15, indicating the project is in late development stages
- The focus of this stream was importing and integrating a piano-playing Shy Guy character into a Wild West saloon level
- Facing significant memory constraints: "it's a ram overflow we're out of memory cool cool all right we have to optimize the fucking level"
- Development involves constant optimization, including micro-optimizations that save microseconds of performance
- Using ROM Manager and working with Mario 64 decompilation
- The game runs on real N64 hardware at close to 60 FPS due to engine optimizations

## Personal Insights
- Kaze recently learned about "soft skills" (interpersonal communication): "someone explained to me what soft skills are... I thought that didn't matter. Did you guys know that? Apparently that's important."
- Analytical approach to games: "I can't enjoy fighting games because anything that's a competitive I just turn it into a spreadsheet simulator... they're no longer games to me they're just math formulas in a permanent loop"
- Shows self-deprecating humor about his social abilities
- Childhood disappointment about wrestling being scripted influenced his perspective on authenticity
- Takes pride in optimization work: "Yes, this whole game runs on real hardware. The scene you just saw actually runs close to 60 FPS on real hardware because my engine is that optimized."

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: No relevant information found in this transcript
- Biobak: No relevant information found in this transcript
- Zeina: Created and animated the piano-playing Shy Guy character and its piano model. Kaze praised the work: "I think she did a good job vertex coloring this"
- Other Contributors: 
  - Lila: Appears to be involved in quality control/testing, particularly concerned with UV errors and visual issues
  - QED: Mentioned regarding asset extraction from Mario Party 2

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Implemented spatial audio for the piano music: "I'm going to pan the music so that it sounds like the guy is playing it"
- Added reactive NPCs: "When the piano guy stops the music, the entire bar should look at you"
- RAM overflow forced level optimization through collision triangle reduction
- Planning a Wild West showdown sequence with countdown timer and card gun from Mario Party 2
- Focus on small immersive details like crowd reactions and proper lighting
- Decided against making the piano-playing character attackable: "Dude, he's there for the vibe. I can't just hit him."

## Business Aspects
- ROM hacking is Kaze's hobby despite full-time commitment: "romhacks are technically just a hobby but I do work on them full-time"
- Has a separate full-time job as a programmer working on Unreal Engine 5 games under NDA
- Concerns about ROM security and leaks: "Yes, there will be better testers, but it's unlikely it will be you. I don't know you. You could leak my ROM"
- No direct monetization mentioned for the ROM hack project

## Key Quotes
- "someone explained to me what soft skills are... I thought that didn't matter. Did you guys know that? Apparently that's important."
- "Yes, this whole game runs on real hardware. The scene you just saw actually runs close to 60 FPS on real hardware because my engine is that optimized."
- "When the piano guy stops the music, the entire bar should look at you... They're like, what the fuck, brah? Why'd you stop my jam? I was vibing."

## Potential Interview Topics
- The challenge of balancing a full-time game development job with an equally demanding ROM hacking "hobby"
- How hardware limitations drive creative problem-solving and the satisfaction of optimization
- The collaborative process: How do you integrate assets from multiple artists while maintaining performance?
- The philosophy behind small immersive details and their impact on player experience
- Security and trust issues in the ROM hacking community and how they affect development and testing
