## Game Development Process
- Working on implementing a light bridge mechanic that appears when pressing arcade buttons, changes color as a warning, then disappears
- Major milestone: Integration of new Mario model created by Biobak with 39-40% TMEM usage decrease and 30 fewer triangles than the original
- Advanced N64 optimization work including cache management: "I'm gonna read the instruction cache and the history of which thread ran last, so I can predict the thread that runs next and prefetch instructions into iCache"
- Using Mario 64 decompilation as the base for this ROM hack
- Engine code will be released together with the rest of the game

## Personal Insights
- Extremely excited about the new Mario model: "Oh my god, this looks so insanely good" and "I'm gonna send this to Lila. Lila's gonna be so sad"
- Perfectionist approach to details: Spent significant time trying to add a subtle "butt crease" to Mario despite collaborator's preference
- Believes in player agency: "I want the player to trigger this" (referring to the light bridge mechanic)
- Humorous and candid about sponsorship opportunities: "I have been reached out by a dildo company, they wanted pictures of my dicks so they could make dildos after me and sell them to my fans"

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: Not mentioned in this stream
- Biobak/Biomech: Graphics artist who created the new Mario model with extensive optimizations including "Updated shoes now with shine and salts," "Updated eyes, all three variations," "Thicker eyebrows, shinier shading," and numerous texture optimizations
- Zeina: Not mentioned in this stream  
- Other Contributors:
  - Salwar: Music collaborator, planning to create rap/music together using FL Studio: "So if we do end up doing that stupid romming idea we have, we're gonna make a banger"
  - Leela: Developer who can help fix bugs, mentioned multiple times
  - Bekkar: Another developer who can fix bugs
  - Clayman: Sent a song for the stream

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Light bridge design: "So I was thinking of maybe using layer 4 here. Makes it absolutely unambiguous" - addressing visibility concerns
- Texture optimization challenges: Struggled with implementing anti-aliasing while maintaining proper coloring for Mario's cap
- Decision to use dithering for visual appeal: "Yeah, that doesn't look too bad. It's kinda nice. Kinda like it"
- Challenge with concurrent light sources: "The problem with that light source is that we can only add like five of them to Mario, I think"
- Fast64 bug causing misplaced objects that "there's literally nothing I can do about it"

## Business Aspects
- Declined dildo company sponsorship offer
- Potential Manscaped sponsorship in progress: "we are probably getting a Manscaped Sponsorship. I can talk about my shaved balls on YouTube videos next"
- Awareness of YouTube performance: Stream technical issues "going to ruin my stream stats unfortunately"
- Expectation of viral potential: "This Mario model is going to be my first 1 million viewer video that Nintendo doesn't take down"

## Key Quotes
- "The eyes, okay, the eyes are very nice, the buttons are very nice... This model has 170 triangles less than 64 Mario. And it has smaller textures than N64 Mario."
- "I'm gonna create a dirty exclusive, a few bytes of cache, and then hit invalidate before flushing them out, so that all the OS level functions can run without ever assessing RAM."
- "People are going to be so upset about this... Maru's ass got nerfed"

## Potential Interview Topics
- The technical innovations in N64 optimization and cache management - how these push the boundaries of what's possible on the hardware
- The collaborative process with artists like Biobak - how detailed optimization discussions shape the final visual design
- The balance between technical perfectionism and creative vision - why spend time on details like Mario's "butt crease"?
- The decision-making process behind sponsorships and monetization for ROM hack creators
- The planned music/rap collaboration with Salwar and how it fits into the game's identity
