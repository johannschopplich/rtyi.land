## Game Development Process
- Currently working on Course 11 out of 15, indicating the project is in advanced stages: "This is course 11 out of 15 So 11 means we are already pretty far"
- Transitioning from modeling to programming phase: "We're almost ready to stop programming it"
- ROM size is at 42.8 MB out of 64 MB N64 limitation
- Game runs fast but is currently unstable: "Currently not in a state where it would run very well. It would, like, keep crashing. I mean, it runs, like, very fast, but, like, not very stable."
- Achieved extreme draw distance on N64 hardware: "It's infinite drawing distance. Look, you can see the birds from here. All the way over there."

## Personal Insights
- Frustration with YouTube algorithm favoring low-effort content: "I worked super hard on this video. 120k. This stupid fucking meme video, 160k... No one gives a shit about anything."
- Strong opinions on game design, particularly regarding Sonic Mania's reaction-time requirements
- Design philosophy emphasizing accessibility: "Basically anything should be possible without a back jump. It's my prerogative."
- Dealing with personal challenges including bike theft and tennis elbow diagnosis
- Considering annual April Fool's videos as tradition due to their success

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: No relevant information found
- Biobak: No relevant information found  
- Zeina: No relevant information found
- Other Contributors: 
  - Lila: Provides feedback on visual elements and camera positioning ("Lila was complaining about it and I kind of saw her point"). Appears to be involved in fixing visual issues with cutouts/textures
  - Unnamed contributor who provided a stream banner during the stream

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Implementing wind turbines as core platforming mechanics with timed on/off cycles
- Struggled with gimbal lock issues when rotating 3D models: "Fucking gimbal lock. I hate this."
- Design philosophy against requiring advanced techniques: "Basically anything should be possible without a back jump"
- Balancing difficulty for 100% completion vs casual players: "people are going to try to 100% them and if there's one thing that is much more difficult than the rest Of the game people are going to get really frustrated with it"
- Working on red coin missions and placement strategy
- Struggling with blue coin switch design: "It's really difficult to make a good blue coin switch, though. I hate the one I made, too."

## Business Aspects
- Transitioning from Twitch to YouTube streaming: "I am trying to transition from twitch because twitch is going down the gutter"
- Plans to release source code: "I fully intend to please the source because when it's done and I might backport it to the original 64 if you want"
- Speaking at tech conference about N64 hacking and reverse engineering
- Considering platform strategy based on viewer numbers: "shoutouts to 50 few to viewers today, that is a new record for YouTube"

## Key Quotes
- "I literally don't even think it's crazy to say anymore that this looks like a GameCube game." (regarding the visual quality achieved on N64)
- "Right now YouTube is in the background noise matter. You're not supposed to make engaging videos You're supposed to make videos that can be listened to while they're in the background"
- "Even though that video was an April Fool's joke, it did better than most of my normal videos... My preview of just making a level that I spent hundreds of hours on, 120k. This one, 40k. Randomizer, 40k. No one gives a shit about anything."

## Potential Interview Topics
- The technical challenges and innovations in pushing N64 hardware beyond its perceived limits (draw distance, performance optimization)
- The tension between creating quality technical content vs algorithm-friendly content on YouTube
- The collaborative process with team members like Lila and how feedback shapes the final product
- The philosophy behind making challenging games accessible to all skill levels
- The decision to open-source the project and its potential impact on the ROM hacking community
