## Game Development Process
- Currently working on a power plant/oil level with multiple sections including platforms, elevators, and enemy placement
- Performance optimization achieved significant improvements: "We went from 43 to 45 fps to the range of 45 to 49 fps" with some areas reaching 47 fps after culling fixes
- Planning to release "one or two more demos where people can just play test the physics" before the final RTYI release
- Iterative level design process shown through constant adjustments to platform placement and enemy positioning
- Identified balance issues: "I think we have an issue with my areas having too few enemies"

## Personal Insights
- Uncertainty about audience preferences: "I honestly have no idea what people want anymore... I feel like a lot of programmers watch my channel now and not so much the casual audience"
- Financial sustainability concerns: "I also don't want to work on hacks that are not gonna be a financial success"
- Creative burnout on remasters: "I am NOT remastering OOT no unless that was decent financial incentive to do so... having done it once like why would I want to do it again"
- Commitment to quality before release: "I want to release at least one hack where it's like this is all perfect And then I put RTYI out because once I have RTYI out I can't really change anything anymore"

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: No relevant information found in this transcript
- Biobak: Works on graphics/textures - Kaze mentions waiting for Biobak's texture work: "I'm just gonna pick random textures. I'll change them when I rework the level... I can't really change many things right now without knowing the exact textures"
- Zeina: Works on animations, recently moved to work in a different room (upstairs while Kaze works in basement). Kaze jokes about their working relationship: "Zeina is finally out of my hair she is upstairs now and I'm downstairs"
- Other Contributors: 
  - Mario: Level designer working on textures for the power plant area
  - UAD: Previously collaborated with Kaze on the Grantee Industries level
  - Lila/Leela: Community member who became a moderator during the stream

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Implementing "oil fuzzy" enemies inspired by Yoshi's Island's "Touch Fuzzy Get Dizzy" mechanic with effects including: making Mario super slippery, activating trippy visual effects, increasing squash-and-stretch animations
- Platform displacement bugs requiring troubleshooting: "This shouldn't have worked at all and yet somehow it kind of did"
- Camera collision challenges in platform-heavy areas: "The problem here is that the camera also kind of sucks... I don't like that. You can't see Mario"
- Texture scrolling implementation issues requiring multiple attempts to fix
- Designing Yoshi coin placement with accessibility in mind: "I want the Yoshi coin to be in the first room... so you don't have to do half the star again if you miss the Yoshi coin"

## Business Aspects
- Currently employed at Gears for Breakfast (GFB) with NDAs preventing discussion of current projects
- Financial considerations drive project selection: "I can't just do it it would be irresponsible... I need financial incentive"
- Demo release strategy to test mechanics before final release
- Awareness of content performance: "I'm working on a video on the inverse square root I think it might do okay on YouTube"
- Recognition that technical content performs better with current audience than casual content

## Key Quotes
- "I do want to release more hacks before I release RTYI just to get the camera and the physics just right because when I released only up 64 I noticed issues with the camera I noticed issues with the side flip"
- "Touch fuzzy get dizzy... They should make Mario super slippery so you can't stop... The weird effect happens... Mario's squash and stretch effect becomes 5x strong"
- "I feel like a lot of programmers watch my channel now and not so much the casual audience ever since the source code reveal so now what's popular is like the technical stuff and not the baby easy simple stuff"

## Potential Interview Topics
- The transition from hobbyist ROM hacking to professional game development and how financial realities shaped project decisions
- The collaborative process of creating RTYI, including how team members work together despite physical separation
- Technical innovations in N64 ROM hacking, particularly performance optimization techniques that pushed the hardware limits
- Balancing community expectations with creative vision, especially as the audience shifted from casual players to technical enthusiasts
- The iterative design philosophy behind RTYI and the importance of pre-release demos for perfecting game mechanics
