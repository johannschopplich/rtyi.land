## Game Development Process
- Beta testing for course 6 completed successfully ("beta test of course 6 running today and it went super well")
- Currently working on overworld design and placing secret level entrances to improve area density
- Island development is nearly halfway complete - finishing parts 6 and 7, then moving to underground tunnel
- Side levels are designed to be quick to produce: "all these side levels will be super quick to produce. They all will just take like a day at most. And they will add so much to the game"
- Planning to finalize Mario's model soon to prevent further rework
- Using Fast64 tool to export levels into Mario 64 decompilation

## Personal Insights
- Contemplating future direction: "after RTYI I don't know if I'm gonna make more hacks or just start making my own games depends on the success of RTYI"
- Vision for potential success: "if I make 20 million dollars off of RTYI I'm opening a game studio and the game studio is going to make romhacks and real games"
- Frustrated with Nintendo's actions: "do you know how famous I would be if Nintendo didn't constantly take my videos down? every time a video had like a million views they took it down"
- Theory on Nintendo's stance: "my theory is that they know that I'm just kind of fucking insane and that they don't want to deal with it"
- Values professional feedback: Would show work to Miyamoto because "feedbacks always valuable especially when it's from another game designer"
- Acknowledges scope creep but justifies it: "But all of this is like a week or two of work, so it doesn't matter"

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: No specific mentions in this transcript
- Biobak: Mentioned in financial context ("after I pay Biobak"), suggesting they're a paid contributor
- Zeina: Briefly mentioned, appears to be present during stream but no specific contributions detailed
- Other Contributors:
  - Saren: Creating music for the retro section with "fully dynamic music, like Breath of the Wild has it basically"
  - Lila/Leela: Active helper during stream, working on "Fallout 64," assists with technical issues and provides feedback on design decisions

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Emulator compatibility issues: Parallel Launcher had bugs that prevented demo from running properly for many users
- Design philosophy on coins: "We need the coins to do something" - implementing various coin-based unlocks and NPC interactions
- Addressing empty overworld spaces: "there's a huge empty stretch of land here" - solving by adding secret level entrances
- Creative level entrance design: Yoshi athlete who gets stronger through sponsorship and eventually jumps to the moon
- Technical limitations: "we can't have Mario have to talk about wing caps in the overworld for technical reasons"
- Balancing coin sinks to avoid forced farming: Concerned about players feeling obligated to grind coins early
- Movement options deliberately limited: "We can't really give Mario more movement options, because it's too restrictive on how we can actually model the island"

## Business Aspects
- Financial viability questioned: "will RTYI even be a net positive money wise for you"
- Income sources mentioned: YouTube channel and Patreon, though notes they exist independently of RTYI
- Nintendo has taken down 71 of his videos, impacting channel growth and revenue
- Considering sponsorship for F3 event: "F3 has always been a non-sponsored event, but sponsors are so fucking lucrative"
- Releases mods as patches to stay in "legal gray area": "patches are kind of a legal gray area and they know that and they don't want to risk changing that gray area"
- Hypothetical business model: Creating a studio that makes both "real games" and fan games simultaneously to "market each other"

## Key Quotes
- "Nintendo already knows about this ROM hack. if they were going to DMCA it they would have already done it"
- "wait why is no one doing that... imagine you just make a Pokemon inspired game but then also release the game as like a Pokemon romhack"
- "the thing is though they don't even take down the mods. the mods are always released as patches and patches are kind of a legal gray area"

## Potential Interview Topics
- The impact of Nintendo's 71 video takedowns on the project's development and marketing strategy
- The creative process behind designing "half-day" side levels that add significant value to the game
- The evolution from ROM hacker to potential game studio founder - what drives this transition?
- Collaboration dynamics with team members like Saren (music) and how remote collaboration works in ROM hack development
- The technical and design philosophy behind coin-based progression systems and avoiding "forced farming"
