## Game Development Process
- Currently at 11 out of 15 courses completed, with ROM size at 45.9 MB out of 64 MB limit
- Major focus on implementing oil block boss fight with flee mechanics and soap-based damage system
- Performance improvements implemented off-stream: "there's also some sick performance improvement I did off stream"
- Planning to finish boss fight implementation during day off on Monday
- Struggling with ROM size constraints: "our ROM is 45.9 megabytes that's like almost three quarters of there to 64 megabytes"

## Personal Insights
- On his programming ability: "I was literally just born with the ability to code like unironically I was just born and able to program right away"
- Work preferences: "when I work on actually complex things that I'm having fun with, then I probably work faster off stream. That's why I keep the complicated stuff for, like, off stream"
- Frustration with modern game design: "They're turning video games into chores. Video games are not supposed to be chores!"
- On having Mr. Beast's money: "if I had mr. beast money I would just make games forever... I would hire more game more people to help me make games"
- Recently bought a house and moving on the 23rd

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: Composed new music for "boombox koopas" - "We have a new song for the boombox koopas that Baduk made. It's really good"
- Biobak: Created models for the oil block boss - Kaze mentions "I am gonna slightly ruin biomex model" when adjusting it
- Lila: Appears to be providing technical support with Fast64 issues and giving feedback on visual design
- T Lopez: Mentioned as soundtrack creator
- Other Contributors: No additional named contributors mentioned

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Boss arena evolved from oil barrel concept to warehouse/cave hybrid after struggling with visual cohesion
- Implementing complex boss mechanics: flee behavior, soap-based attacks, platform management
- ROM size crisis: "sound data table here this is 35.6 megabytes of just music two-thirds of the ROM is just music"
- Considering converting streamed music to sequenced music to save space, but concerned about quality loss
- Balancing difficulty: "I don't want the gap between like a bad player and a good player to be too big"

## Business Aspects
- YouTube revenue recently doubled, possibly due to ad blocker changes: "I made so much more money I'll get this it's like twice what I usually make"
- Has full-time job limiting development time: "I don't know when it's coming out. I have a full-time job"
- Committed to N64 hardware compatibility and 64 MB limit
- No specific release date or distribution plans mentioned

## Key Quotes
- "if we were to convert one of the songs of the sequence that be of course one song or we could also turn some songs into mono which I don't want to go this over 64 megabytes that's kind of like defeats the purpose"
- "It makes it easier to stay focused on simple tasks, because I have some stuff to do in the background. But then when I work on actually complex things that I'm having fun with, then I probably work faster off stream"
- "dude if I had mr. beast money I would just make games forever yeah I guess nothing would really change actually no I would hire more game more people to help me make games we'd be the big company"

## Potential Interview Topics
- The challenge of working within N64 hardware limitations and how it influences creative decisions
- The collaborative process with Badub on music composition given the severe ROM size constraints
- Balancing full-time work with passion project development and community engagement
- The iterative design process shown in the boss arena evolution and when to pivot design concepts
- Philosophy on game difficulty and accessibility - creating challenges without making games feel like "chores"
