## Game Development Process
- Game development started at the end of 2020, dispelling assumptions about a decade-long development cycle: "I don't have a decade-long release cycle. I started this game like at the end of 2020."
- Currently in active development focusing on overworld/hub world design with beaches, sand textures, and environmental transitions
- No fixed release date, following a "when it's done" philosophy: "Well, there is no release date yet. So, like, what do you want me to do? I don't know when it releases. It gets done when it's done."
- The overworld is designed to change throughout the game to feel alive and dynamic: "The overworld changes throughout the game. It's supposed to feel alive."
- Using Fast64 for asset pipeline but dealing with export bugs that affect texture rendering and vertex colors

## Personal Insights
- Shows strong perfectionist tendencies and openness to improvement: "I'm someone who doesn't really take any issue with being corrected. I just care about becoming as good as possible"
- Believes in following creative instincts: "Sometimes you just have to go with what your heart desires, you know? That's what game design is all about."
- Expresses philosophical views on game graphics and artistic expression, questioning whether increased fidelity takes away from what makes games special
- Self-describes as extremely frugal: "You have no idea how much of a cheap fuck I am. I hate spending money."
- Shows patience with iterative development: "I just started! Calm down! I have no time yet! Chill."

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: Composer who created the overworld music and updated music for courses. The overworld music is described as "a banger" and was composed using similar instruments to the vanilla game
- Biobak: Graphics artist who will refine the overworld after Kaze's initial blocking. Kaze is creating a foundation for Biobak to work from: "I'm just getting something like semi decent going. So then when Biobak starts working on this, he has a good starting point."
- Zeina: Working on animations, specifically created bunny footprint textures during the stream at Kaze's request (128x32 texture with multiple footprints)
- Other Contributors:
  - Lilaa: Responsible for some game mechanics, associated with a "random mode bug" that Kaze jokingly wants to "yell at her" about
  - Marty: Working on something that's "basically done" but hasn't been imported yet
  - Sauron: Developing a version of the legacy vertex pipeline that enables Fresnel effects

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Implementing realistic water foam effects on beaches proved challenging due to N64 limitations with transparent decal layers
- Designing a coconut mechanic: "All the coconut trees have coconuts. You can kick them to make them drop the coconuts that may have 0 to 5 coins in them. Some sleeping character you can conk with a coconut."
- Creating natural-looking transitions between sand, grass, and rock textures while working within N64 texture size constraints
- Dealing with Fast64 export bugs that affect random values and vertex colors
- Balancing visual fidelity with performance: "You can only have one UV mapper, I think. So if you did have a light map, it would have to have the same UVs, and that's so limiting that in practice you can say it can't do it."

## Business Aspects
- No discussion of pricing or specific distribution plans
- Jokes about "selling the channel" but indicates uncertainty about future content direction
- Emphasis on quality over meeting deadlines or market pressures
- Community engagement through live streaming development process

## Key Quotes
- "Sometimes you just have to go with what your heart desires, you know? That's what game design is all about. I feel like I want the rock, so I'm going to make a rock."
- "Do you guys think that the increase in fidelity that games in general have received has inevitably taken away something that makes games special in the same way that taking a picture doesn't feel as special as drawing a painting?"
- "The overworld changes throughout the game. It's supposed to feel alive."

## Potential Interview Topics
1. The evolution of the project from 2020 to present - what has changed from the original vision and what discoveries were made along the way?
2. The collaborative process between Kaze, Badub, Biobak, and other team members - how do they coordinate and iterate on each other's work?
3. The technical challenges and creative solutions when working within N64 hardware limitations
4. The philosophy behind creating a "living" overworld that changes throughout the game - what inspired this approach?
5. The balance between perfectionism and practical development - how does Kaze decide when something is "good enough" to move forward?
