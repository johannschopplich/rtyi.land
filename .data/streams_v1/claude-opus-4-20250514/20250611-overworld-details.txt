## Game Development Process
- Course 7 is complete and has been sent out for beta testing
- The game currently runs fully on real N64 hardware, which Kaze describes as "amazing"
- ROM size is at 59.953 MB, targeting to stay at or below 64 MB total
- Overworld development is ongoing - planning to consolidate it into "one big level that loads dynamically as you walk through it"
- Side levels are planned to be smaller in scope, with each taking "a day or two at most" to create
- The game will feature approximately 120 music tracks
- Kaze mentions "we rewrote the engine so many times" indicating significant technical iterations
- Game has "a good chance of being done by the end of the year" contingent on work situation

## Personal Insights
- "Streams don't make a lot of money. I would be a lot better off just making YouTube videos. If I just made YouTube videos, I think I could pretty easily get like... Just from YouTube videos, maybe like 60,000-70,000 a year."
- On philosophy: "anytime I read theory like that, I'm just like, yeah, this is the most fucking obvious shit ever. Why do you write a book?"
- Considering YouTube sponsorship for F3: "that's like the easiest way I can justify making another F3. If I get paid for it. Because I need to pay my editor and stuff."
- On customized ads: "I prefer customized ads. If I'm going to have to sit there and watch a fucking ad, at least show me a product I might want to buy."

- Other Contributors: 
  - Lila/Leela: Appears to be a Fast64 tool developer providing technical support during the stream, helping troubleshoot rendering and export issues
  - Unnamed editor: Mentioned as someone Kaze needs to pay for video work
  - Beta testers: Currently testing course 7

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Implemented new "exit course dialog" feature: "After you get a star, you can now just exit the course... Do you want to return to the overworld? Stay or leave?"
- Luigi integration confirmed but implementation unclear: "the stream special guest today is Luigi... I'm not 100% sure exactly how Luigi ties into this yet. Co-op would be the coolest option."
- Side level concept involving "an oil tanker full of enemies that you have to infiltrate" with boss fight leading to "oily body bay"
- Technical challenges with decal emulation and rendering accuracy
- Performance issues with Blender 4.2 causing significant slowdowns
- Overworld design challenge: "there's going to be stuff like the tree here that's going to be visible from multiple sides"

## Business Aspects
- Considering YouTube sponsorship for F3 video: "How much would you guys hate the idea of F3 this year having a YouTube sponsor?"
- Financial reality of content creation: streams generate less revenue than YouTube videos
- Needs to pay editor for video work
- In two weeks will be "off work" allowing for potentially "a full two weeks of streams"

## Key Quotes
- "It fully works on real N64, which is amazing."
- "After your pass is done, I'm going to make this all into one big level that loads dynamically as you walk through it."
- "These side levels, I hope we can make them a little faster. These are going to be, like, small levels. We're probably going to make each one of them in, like, a day or two at most."

## Potential Interview Topics
- The technical achievement and importance of real N64 hardware compatibility in modern ROM hack development
- The evolution from separate overworld sections to a dynamically loading unified world
- Balancing creative ambition with financial sustainability in indie game development
- The role of live streaming in the development process and community building
- The iterative nature of engine rewrites and how technical challenges shaped the final game
