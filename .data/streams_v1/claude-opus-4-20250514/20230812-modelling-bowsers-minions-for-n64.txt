## Game Development Process
- Actively implementing new gameplay mechanics including a soap bar that functions like a rideable Koopa shell and shrinks over time
- Completed programming the entire soap bar mechanic with particle effects in a single stream session ("we programmed the whole soap bar just today that's that's not that bad with a pretty sick effect")
- Fixed all bugs found in OnlyUp64 over the previous week, including implementing ledge grab functionality and fixing wall jumping issues
- Working on star select screen redesign with panoramic previews for each level
- Developing an oil slick mechanic that can be cleaned with the soap bar

## Personal Insights
- Strong preference for not revisiting old projects: "I don't like going back and updating shit"
- Critical view of philosophy as a discipline: "Philosophy is kind of stupid"
- Uses Project64 emulator (sarcastically referred to as "the best emulator on the market")
- Received unusual harassment (including a rape threat) apparently related to his views on philosophy
- Values efficient development and is conscious of ROM space limitations

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: No direct mentions in this transcript
- Biobak: Created concept designs for the new star select screen featuring small panoramas for each level; Kaze appreciates their "simple drawings" style and considers their ideas superior to his own attempts
- Zeina: Mentioned as being at work during the stream
- Other Contributors: 
  - Arthur: Active stream viewer who appears regularly in chat
  - Anonymous Moose: Had similar gameplay ideas independently
  - Unnamed developer: Creator of a useful tool from 20 years ago who contacted Kaze about making a new version

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Star select screen: "Basically, each level is gonna have a very small panorama that shows the vibe of the level"
- Final puzzle level design philosophy: "It's not going to be anything too difficult because people need to be able to beat it. It's going to feel epic, but it's not going to be super difficult"
- Soap bar mechanic includes riding functionality, progressive shrinking, and bubble particle trail effects
- Oil slick implementation challenges: Debating between rainbow coloring (for visual appeal) vs realistic black appearance, implementing cleaning mechanics with alpha transparency
- ROM space optimization is a constant concern, particularly regarding texture storage

## Business Aspects
- Hosting F3 event ("This year's F3 will be the best F3 yet")
- Received approximately 100 prize submissions for F3 but could only accept a few
- Has a donation link in stream description that was recently fixed
- No specific mentions of marketing, funding models, or release plans for Return to Yoshi's Island

## Key Quotes
- "So this is the new idea for the star select. Basically, each level is gonna have a very small panorama that shows the vibe of the level."
- "It's not going to be anything too difficult because people need to be able to beat it. It's going to feel epic, but it's not going to be super difficult."
- "I like the simple drawings in Biobak's content a lot. I tried a simple drawings version too... Honestly, this is such a vibe, but it just looks terrible. But the vibe is there, you know what I mean?"

## Potential Interview Topics
- The collaborative design process with Biobak and how visual concepts are integrated into the game
- Design philosophy regarding difficulty balance and accessibility for all players
- Technical innovations and challenges specific to ROM hacking within N64 hardware limitations
- The role of community events like F3 in the ROM hacking scene
- Evolution of design thinking from previous projects (OnlyUp64, other ROM hacks) to Return to Yoshi's Island
