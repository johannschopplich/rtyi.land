## Game Development Process
- Beta test 1 of Course 4 was completed over the weekend, revealing that "the level overall seems decent except the bugs sucked and the plane mission sucked"
- The game currently has 480 dialogs, which is approximately three times what vanilla Mario 64 had, suggesting significantly expanded content
- Development involves live reworking of areas based on beta feedback - "we are reworking this area here because it sucked"
- Technical optimization is ongoing: "I can read on optimizing the engine or still some areas have to improve. All the big stuff is done. There's just some like small things"

## Personal Insights
- On game design philosophy: "peak game design is this guy i throw you maybe you hit the star there's no reason for this to exist it's just there because fun and you know people are gonna try this"
- Regarding programming: "The only people that care about which programming language you use are people that are not very good at programming. This is the dirty secret they don't want you to know"
- On his creative process: "I love saying stupid stuff on the internet with no one stopping me i would be a great podcaster"
- Shows consideration for player psychology: "These are decisions you have to make as a game designer" (regarding whether to fix the glass visibility issue)

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: Using a sound composer tool created by Kaze to make sound effects - "With the sound composer I made, Badoop is able to make sound effects"
- Biobak: No specific mentions found in this transcript
- Zeina: Creates HD textures for the game - "this one here, is an HD type, it's a texture Zayna made, and I think she draws them in 640x640" (Zayna likely being Zeina)
- Other Contributors:
  - Okayo: Video content creation partner - "okayo has wanted an 800 000 view video since the day we started working together and i think he's finally getting it"
  - Biomech: Contributes game design ideas, specifically the trophy building concept for easter eggs and secrets
  - Beta testers who provided feedback on Course 4

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Changed damage mechanics: "we're gonna make it so that you take damage from the stuff so the goal will be to get to the end without taking as much damage instead of the time limit"
- Player visibility challenge: "the player did not see that there was glass blocking it. So they just ran into the glass and died. I'm not sure if that's something we should fix or if it's like, well, it's kind of a skill issue"
- Trophy room achievement system: "Let's say you go into the trophy room and all the trophies are like empty except for the ones you collected... if you read it, it tells you a hint for how to get the trophy"
- Environmental design challenges: Working extensively on creating believable forest environments with performance constraints

## Business Aspects
- Sponsorship funding: "Well you better pray that squarespace keeps paying up because as long as squarespace pays i'm probably gonna make a video every two weeks"
- Review unit expectations: "I have a feeling they will just send me one so I can make a video about it... I firmly believe if someone does not send me a free copy of the N64 FPGA, they're doing some shady shit"
- Content creation schedule tied to sponsorship deals

## Key Quotes
- "peak game design is this guy i throw you maybe you hit the star there's no reason for this to exist it's just there because fun"
- "So, fun fact, we have 480 dialogs in this game right now, which is around three times what vanilla Mario 64 had, which kind of implies we have three times the content"
- "These are decisions you have to make as a game designer" (regarding balancing difficulty vs. accessibility)

## Potential Interview Topics
- The philosophy of adding unnecessary but fun gameplay elements and how this shapes the overall player experience
- The collaborative process with texture artists, sound designers, and idea contributors - how does remote collaboration work?
- How beta testing feedback is integrated into the development cycle and what criteria determine whether something needs fixing
- The decision to create significantly more content than the original game - what drives this expansion?
- The relationship between content creation (YouTube videos) and game development - how do sponsorships and audience building support the project?
