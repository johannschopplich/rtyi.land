## Game Development Process
- Game is nearing completion: "It's all RTYI and it's getting close to completion. Please stop asking me for release dates. I will literally lose my mind."
- Final game size constraint: "The final game will take up pretty much exactly 64 megabytes"
- Currently working on course 15, a craft/paper/cardboard themed level with snow effects
- Major performance optimizations achieved: "I made the game like twice as fast again, which is why this now runs 30 fps"
- Self-proclaimed as "the first quadruple A N64 game ever" for marketing purposes
- Dealing with ongoing technical issues including crashes and emulator compatibility problems

## Personal Insights
- Frustration with content creation vs. game development: "If it was up to me, I just wouldn't make videos at all, but then I can't do my thing as a hobby. That makes money. I just want to make games, man."
- Dislikes editing videos: "I hate editing myself. So I'm very glad I can just pay someone to do it for me."
- Strong negative feelings about emulator issues: "I hate emulators" and "This garbage emulator man I swear"
- Feeling pressure from community about release dates
- Shows pride in technical achievements and optimizations

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: No specific mentions in this transcript
- Biobak: Mentioned as "Biomech" providing visual design suggestions, particularly for replacing styrofoam texture with paper stapled to cardboard for the craft level
- Zeina: No direct mentions, but "Xena" is referenced in relation to N64 hardware modding and having friends who helped with technical installations
- Other Contributors: 
  - Lera: Artist mentioned in context of creating a peach drawing/model ("Did Lera ever sent us a peach")
  - Xena's friend: Installed HDMI mod on Kaze's N64
  - Unnamed video editor: Kaze pays someone to edit his YouTube videos

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Major focus on performance optimization for course 15: "Yeah, this is the worst performing level by far right now"
- Design philosophy emphasizing consistent physics: "With return to Yoshi's Island, the physics are so much more consistent that everything is easier in that sense"
- Visual design decisions for craft-themed level, including replacing styrofoam texture with paper stapled to cardboard based on collaborator feedback
- Struggling with snow rendering bugs and memory allocation issues
- Implementing tilting platforms and difficulty balancing for platforming sections
- Coin design refinement: "I somehow have the feeling that they are improvable, but I don't know how. The blue coins I'm not 100% sold on."

## Business Aspects
- Considering pricing strategy: "$20? $10? I'm not sure. I'll have to think about it. Do some market research, ask people how much they would be willing to pay."
- Potential PC/Steam release discussed: "If I were to release this game on Steam, obviously I would have to remove all the Mario assets though"
- YouTube video performance concerns: "Oh, the new video is not doing too well. Oh, that sucks. People are not liking this."
- Twitter monetization strategy: "The strategy monetize don't put that you don't make twitter posts you just reply to big posts"
- Main job is programming for a company, game development is a hobby that makes money

## Key Quotes
- "I think if I ever end up making the video with all the source code optimizations that I did in like the whole three years of development, it actually is going to be an hour long and that might be like my craziest video ever."
- "I'm going to say this is the first quadruple A N64 game ever. That's going to be the marketing."
- "With return to Yoshi's Island, the physics are so much more consistent that everything is easier in that sense"

## Potential Interview Topics
- The three-year journey of performance optimization and how it enabled ambitious level designs like Isle Delfino running on N64
- The collaborative process with artists like Biobak and how their suggestions shape the final visual design
- The tension between creating content for YouTube/social media and focusing on game development
- Technical innovations that allow the game to run at consistent 30fps despite being more ambitious than vanilla Mario 64
- The potential transformation from ROM hack to standalone PC game and the creative/legal considerations involved
