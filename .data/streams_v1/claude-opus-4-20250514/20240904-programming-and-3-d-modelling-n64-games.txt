## Game Development Process
- Currently in active development phase, working on 3D modeling for interior rooms and environments
- Major bug discovered with lighting system where "if a second light source appears like the star over there Morris colors just go dark the ambient just resets to zero"
- Performance testing shows 23-30 FPS without room optimization implemented, expecting 60 FPS once room-based rendering is complete
- Demo planned to include only Course 1 (first level)
- Development roadmap: Version 1 (emulator + N64) → Version 1.1 (bug fixes after first month) → Potentially N64-only version for better performance
- Using N64 decompilation as base for ROM hack development

## Personal Insights
- "I hope to be able to stream more. I want to work like a lot harder than I already work. Because I have a child now and I need more money."
- Strong opinions on programming: "I think that if you care at all, like even just a little bit about which programming language you use, that is a very strong indicator that you're a terrible programmer."
- Prioritizes N64 hardware performance: "I want this game to run as well on N64 as it can"
- Shows dedication to quality: "I want to check how course 3 looks like on N64. I want to see that it actually works correctly."

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: No direct mentions in this transcript
- Biobak: Graphics artist who will review visual work - "So it's not insulting to Biobak when I pass this over"
- Zeina: No direct mentions in this transcript
- Other Contributors:
  - Soren: Working on microcode optimization and X3 improvements - "But before I even think about that, I will wait until Sauron is done with everything he wants to do"
  - WiseGuy: Working on static recompilation project, praised for expertise - "WiseGuy is working on it, and WiseGuy knows what he's doing"
  - Dario: Connected to RT64 development

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Implementing room-based rendering system: "The thing about this level here is that everything is in rooms, right? So you see right there in the door. You can't look through it... Which means that this is basically guaranteed 60 FPS"
- Redesigning mirror system for easier implementation: "Dude, this is gonna be the easiest system to add new murals ever"
- Memory allocation challenges requiring per-level adjustments for collision triangles
- Discovered RSP (Reality Signal Processor) is the main bottleneck, not RDP: "We Found out that the bottleneck is actually the rsp and not the rdp"
- Considering tri-strips optimization for future versions
- Working with X3 microcode for better performance over X2

## Business Aspects
- Cannot physically release due to Nintendo copyright: "I can't physically release this game, Christian. Because if I do, I will get giga sued by Nintendo."
- Distribution plan: "I will release a patch that will contain only my own changes. And then you will be able to patch this patch onto an N64 ROM."
- Dealt with sophisticated scam attempt from fake advertising company wanting to promote "web-free teaching service"
- Mentions unauthorized sellers on Etsy selling his games: "there's a lot of people just illegally selling my games"

## Key Quotes
- "The demo is just going to be Course 1, only the first level."
- "Yeah, the lag is basically all RSP actually... that's the entire reason my course one was like stuck at 46 fps because the RSP was the bottleneck"
- "My plan is version 1 of Return to Yoshi's Island is going to work on emulator and N64. Version 1.1 is going to work on both and have the bug fixes from the first thousands of hours of gameplay that we found in there."

## Potential Interview Topics
1. The technical journey from identifying RSP bottlenecks to implementing X3 microcode - what was the breakthrough moment?
2. How does having a child influence your approach to game development and your vision for the project's future?
3. The collaborative process with specialists like Soren, Biobak, and others - how do you coordinate and integrate their contributions?
4. The legal and ethical considerations of ROM hack distribution - how do you balance accessibility with copyright concerns?
5. The decision to potentially abandon emulator support for better N64 performance - what drives this hardware-first philosophy?
