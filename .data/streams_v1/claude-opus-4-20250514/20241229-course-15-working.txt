## Game Development Process
- The RTYI demo is complete but experiencing technical issues: "By the way, the RTYI demo is finished now. But there is a bug in Parallel Launcher that makes my ROM not boot. I'm currently trying to fix it together with the person maintaining Parallel Launcher."
- The game targets 30 FPS on console rather than 60 FPS for performance reasons: "We are going to go for 30 on console. 60 on console is just unreasonable."
- Currently working on level 15, which is the final level of the game: "This is level 15. So it's the last one."
- Plans to include retro-themed areas in every level, with the current level having a Mario 64-themed retro area

## Personal Insights
- Kaze demonstrates self-critical evaluation of his work: "I think it looks like ass. That's weird. Usually it's the person making the thing overestimating it."
- Shows frustration with the design process: "Man, this felt like such an easy level to make, but it's so difficult to make this good."
- Willing to completely abandon concepts that aren't working: "I think we're pushing the arcade theme too much and like no matter how we implement the arcade theme it's not gonna be fun"
- Emphasizes the importance of "placeness" - making levels feel like real, coherent locations rather than arbitrary platforming challenges

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: Composer for the game, has uploaded music to SoundCloud under the name "Adobe". Kaze mentions potentially needing to pay for music rights: "I would have to pay Badub out for the rights to the music or something."
- Biobak: Graphics artist who Kaze pays for work: "Gotta pay a Biobak for his work on here"
- Zeina: No specific mentions in this transcript
- Other Contributors: Person maintaining Parallel Launcher who is helping fix a bug preventing the ROM from booting

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Major pivot from arcade-themed level to "Shy Guy space station" concept after realizing the arcade theme wasn't fun
- Struggle with creating "placeness" - making levels feel like coherent locations: "But it needs to feel more like a space station arcade-type thing"
- Decision to use 1950s-60s retrofuturistic aesthetic for the Shy Guy technology
- Implementation of a space squid boss fight as the first star objective that unlocks the rest of the level
- Technical decision to target 30 FPS on console due to performance constraints

## Business Aspects
- Received a 500 euro donation during the stream, which Kaze puts back into game development
- Plans to potentially monetize the game: "I actually have crazy plans to maybe, hopefully, somehow monetize this game. And if that happens, we're going crazy."
- Considering physical cartridge release: "I could even put the music on the cartridge and then put that out."
- Aware of legal considerations: "That's something I definitely will talk to a copyright lawyer about."
- Currently works for "Gears of War Breakfast" which takes up significant time

## Key Quotes
- "I think if this concept is separate yes that would be easier but we're losing the placeness we're losing all the placeness here"
- "You have to go from the broadest thing down to the finest detail. So adding detail is the complete opposite of what we should do."
- "It's always easier to work with something when it has a function and it's not like an arbitrary thing"

## Potential Interview Topics
- The iterative design process: How do you know when to abandon a concept that isn't working, and how does that decision-making process affect development timelines?
- Community funding and engagement: How has donation-based funding shaped the development process and your relationship with the community?
- Legal and business challenges: What are the unique challenges of potentially monetizing a ROM hack, and how are you navigating copyright considerations?
- Technical constraints vs. creative vision: How do you balance the technical limitations of the N64 hardware with your creative ambitions for the game?
- The concept of "placeness" in level design: Can you explain your philosophy on making game levels feel like real, lived-in spaces rather than abstract platforming challenges?
