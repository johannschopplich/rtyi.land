## Game Development Process
- Currently working on the Astral Arcade level, which now has a finalized plan: "We now finally have a plan for the level and we can start 3D modeling"
- All other courses are completed: "All the other courses are finished now? Yes."
- Level design philosophy follows Mario Galaxy approach: "This level is gonna have a mario galaxy type design philosophy basically Feel open but be linear which we do by like having a bunch of random linear paths that somewhat intersect"
- The level structure involves a main area with flipper pieces below: "We have the main area and below the main area is all the flipper pieces"
- Development involves iterative 3D modeling and programming of game elements

## Personal Insights
- Experiencing increased frustration with audience feedback: "I don't know what it is, but recently I've been getting so much more annoyed at like my YouTube comments and stuff"
- Views programming as an innate ability rather than learned skill: "I was really just born with the ability to program I just had to learn the grammar"
- Considers streaming secondary to video creation: "The main purpose of my microphone is not streaming it's recording videos i do stream but it's a pretty minor part of my online presence"
- Believes in practical learning approach: "To learn blender you just go to the blender documentation on page one and you just start reading and try all the hard case"
- Has strong opinions on game design, including that "games don't need to be in 60fps" being a bad take

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: No relevant information found in this transcript
- Biobak: Mentioned as "Biobak" who will help improve the visual design: "I'm sure Biobak will improve this anyway"
- Zeina: No relevant information found in this transcript
- Other Contributors: 
  - "Wise guy" - Provided textures for the project: "I have these textures wise guy sent them to me"

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Major challenge translating 2D pinball mechanics to 3D space: "We have to keep in mind that the ones we make have to work in 3D space, so we can't do all of this"
- Creating various flipper pieces: rotating flippers, spherical bumpers, triangular bumpers, metal pieces, and trampoline elements
- Design decision to use disconnected floating pieces rather than a cohesive machine: "they are going to be more like disconnected pieces than a whole flipper machine"
- Struggling with visual representation of bumpers that communicate their function: "how do I make a sphere that looks like it pushes you away when you jump into it is it even possible"
- Elements will feature glowing effects and need to be visually coherent: "I'm probably gonna make them all emit light"

## Business Aspects
- Cannot sell beta access due to legal concerns: "I can't give people access because like if I did it via patreon or something I would basically be selling access to the game which would be really bad legally speaking"
- Currently working on a commissioned project that's taking time away from Return to Yoshi's Island: "This is something that I was commissioned to work on a long long time ago and then the person commissioning this Just send money again"
- Receives numerous sponsor requests, many of which are inappropriate or scams: "90 of the sponsor requests you get is like people trying to send you viruses"

## Key Quotes
- "Programming is not something I had to learn I keep saying and people keep saying some bullshit, but I say I was really just born with the ability to program"
- "This level is gonna have a mario galaxy type design philosophy basically Feel open but be linear which we do by like having a bunch of random linear paths that somewhat intersect"
- "I can't give people access because like if I did it via patreon or something I would basically be selling access to the game which would be really bad legally speaking"

## Potential Interview Topics
1. The challenge of translating 2D game mechanics (like pinball) into 3D space and the creative solutions developed
2. The collaborative process with artists like Biobak ("Biobak") and how their contributions shape the final design
3. The legal and business considerations of developing a ROM hack, including beta testing and distribution
4. The design philosophy of creating "open but linear" levels inspired by Mario Galaxy
5. The balance between commissioned work, streaming, video creation, and passion project development
