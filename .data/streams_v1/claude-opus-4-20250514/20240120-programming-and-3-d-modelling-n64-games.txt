## Game Development Process
- Game started development around mid-2020, making it approximately 3-4 years in development
- Currently working on a cowboy/western themed level featuring a saloon with secret areas
- Recently implemented new dialogue cutscene system: "We have new dialogue cutscenes. You see that? I should add that to my in-case clips list."
- Game currently has around 85 stars planned, with potential expansion to 165-175 stars in final version: "The Final version is likely gonna have more than 165 stars just because we kept adding new ideas to it. Maybe like 175."
- Actively improving optimization algorithms for better performance
- Using custom engine with 8MB memory allocation (4MB extra for performance improvements)

## Personal Insights
- Strong anti-monetization philosophy: "I actually think video games should not be monetized off of video game sales. I think that's a stupid concept. Because you can make free copies of your video game. Like, it doesn't cost you anything."
- Conscious of role model status: "when you are an online creator like SimpleFlips or me you kind of are also gonna be a role model for a lot of people so there is additional responsibility on you to live your life in a good way."
- Frustrated with Nintendo's copyright enforcement: "My channel would be a lot more blown up if it wasn't for Nintendo trying to sabotage me. But it is what it is." (Over 70 videos taken down)
- Values functionality over expensive equipment: "I usually always get the cheapest thing that works like with anything in life."
- Believes in open source development and community access

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: No specific information found in this transcript
- Biobak/Biobak: Actively involved in level design discussions, contributing ideas for the minecart sequence and dialogue. Appears to be a regular collaborator in chat during streams
- Zeina: Responsible for animations/models, specifically mentioned for milk bottle assets: "We still need a bunch of milk bottles and stuff and Zeina said she wanted to give those to us, but I guess she forgot."
- Other Contributors: 
  - SBK: Mentioned briefly at stream start
  - Lila/Leela: Active in chat, apparently working on Fast64 tool development
  - Various community members contributing design ideas during stream

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Implementing a secret speakeasy-style room where shy guys illegally drink chocolate milk: "a bunch of cowboys are hanging out and they're secretly drinking choccy milk, which is illegal in this world"
- Designing intuitive minecart chase sequence with multiple gameplay approaches (jumping between carts vs. staying in one)
- Challenge with player guidance vs. freedom: "I don't know how much freedom should give players and it should end when they ruin their playthrough for themselves"
- Technical challenges with texture rendering and UV mapping in cave environments
- Balancing cinematic moments with player control: "I hate when games do that. I don't want the player to control the sound per sound effect though."
- Environmental storytelling through NPC placement: "The important characters will turn towards you so you know who to talk to if you just want to make progress."

## Business Aspects
- Game will be completely free and open source: "I am not gonna sell the game, it will be downloadable for free. Yes, it will also be open source. Free and open source."
- Considering selling physical OST cartridge with box and manual as memorabilia: "I might sell a version of the game that is just the OST. So like just an OST cartridge and it's gonna come with a box and an instruction manual."
- Philosophy against game sales: "I think maybe you should sell souvenirs of your video games. Right? Or like plushies. Stuff like that. Just merch."
- Not expecting high sales but values having physical items exist: "I mentioned not a lot of people are gonna buy it, but I think it's just gonna be really cool to have that exist."

## Key Quotes
- "I actually think video games should not be monetized off of video game sales. I think that's a stupid concept. Because you can make free copies of your video game."
- "It started in 2020, I'm pretty sure. Like mid-2020."
- "when you are an online creator like SimpleFlips or me you kind of are also gonna be a role model for a lot of people so there is additional responsibility on you to live your life in a good way."
