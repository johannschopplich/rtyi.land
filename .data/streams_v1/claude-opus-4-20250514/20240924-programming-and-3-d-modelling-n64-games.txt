## Game Development Process
- The paper/craft-themed level has been in development for "a week or two" and is in early stages
- "Obviously, this is a very early version of the level. We started on this like a week or two ago."
- 15 main courses are planned for the full game
- Testing is being done on real N64 hardware: "Oh, they're actually using boots. And the framerate is not completely atrocious. This is the 8000 polygon level that we did not optimize yet."
- The game uses custom engine features built on Mario 64 decompilation with bug fixes and quality of life improvements

## Personal Insights
- Kaze maintains creative control despite community feedback: "I'm not making changes specifically just so you can back amuse. If you can back amuse, that's a great. I enjoyed it as well, but I'm not going to cater to that."
- Shows awareness of criticism: "I'm surprised people are saying the paper level looks good because on my last few videos, people seem to really dislike it."
- Values accessibility: "I never charge for my games. I wouldn't be allowed to. If I was allowed to, maybe I would. Actually, what would I do if I was allowed to charge for this game? Probably release the base game for free and then you could buy a skin or something."
- Frustrated with technical limitations: "Who made this texture? Hitler? Sorry. Got a little upset."

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: Composer who will create music for the game. Kaze mentions: "I'm gonna see what music Badoob is gonna come up. Ideally I'm gonna have a music that changes depending on which biome of the level you're in."
- Biobak: Graphics artist who has worked on textures. Mentioned as having "swapped those out" referring to enemy textures
- Zeyna: Animator who wants to contribute to cloud designs: "Zeyna wants to draw in clouds anyway, so I'm attaching them right now"
- Leela/Lila: Appears to be providing technical assistance with vertex coloring and other implementation details
- Other Contributors: Various community members in chat providing design suggestions and feedback

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Struggling to balance the spin jump mechanic: "Another thing I really wanna work on today is figuring out a way to make the spin jump less oppressive on the whole game's design as a whole. I think the spin jump is cool, but it's way too strong."
- Implementing a paper/craft aesthetic with specific materials: cardboard, cotton balls, styrofoam, paper cutouts
- Challenge of making paper water effect: "How do we make paper water? Tinsel? What's tinsel? That's way too high poly. Paper waves may eat? True. Blue cellophane. But then you wouldn't be able to go through it."
- Yoshi coin placement as special interactions rather than simple collectibles
- Normal mapping implementation for styrofoam effect: "I found out that what I wanted wasn't actually a normal map. It was... I have no idea what I wanted was. But it is the thing I have now."

## Business Aspects
- The game will be released for free: "Yes, it will release for free. I never charge for my games."
- Source code will be made public: "Yes, the source will be public."
- Legal limitations prevent charging: "I wouldn't be allowed to. If I was allowed to, maybe I would."
- No specific marketing or release date mentioned

## Key Quotes
- "I think the spin jump is cool, but it's way too strong. Yeah I haven't run Excalibur yet Lila, definitely planned."
- "I'm not making changes specifically just so you can back amuse. If you can back amuse, that's a great. I enjoyed it as well, but I'm not going to cater to that."
- "Obviously, this is a very early version of the level. We started on this like a week or two ago."
