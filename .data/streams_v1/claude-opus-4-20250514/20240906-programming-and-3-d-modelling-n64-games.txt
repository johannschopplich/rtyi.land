## Game Development Process
- Currently working on course 13, implementing a Super Mario Land 1 retro level
- Completed UV mapping for walls and basic textures off-stream
- Actively debugging crashes related to collision triangles and coin formations in the level
- Converting 2D sprites from Mario Land into 3D voxel art models
- Planning to implement a forced perspective camera system for a plane/shooter section
- Game targets 60 FPS performance
- Using expansion pack to make development "a little easier"

## Personal Insights
- "I have officially lost my mind. I am actually working. On my major hack." - Shows self-awareness about dedication to the project
- "I need to work more because I want to make more money. So that's why I'm gonna just stream like basically every day now. Because I'm very efficient working on stream." - Balancing family financial needs with development
- "I got three whole months of it long for having a child. But also, I need to work more because I want to make more money."
- Strong preference for Mario Land 1 over 2: "I haven't played Land 2 as a child. So for me, Land 1 is like the only one that I will have some nostalgia for."
- Acknowledges Project64's flaws but prefers it: "The thing is, every emulator is broken as fuck. It's just that I've been using this emulator because this one is the easiest one to use."

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Struggling to choose between submarine/shooter level vs traditional platforming for Mario Land 1 section: "The problem is that I can't think of a way to make the submarine section interesting"
- Implementing black and white aesthetic for retro levels: "Now we're definitely doing the whole thing in black and white. That's essential to the aesthetic."
- Creating front-facing sprites for enemies in shooter sections: "How do these submarine levels work?... We have to make front sprites for everything then. I don't want to make front sprites for everything."
- Limiting play area visually for forced perspective sections
- Rule for retro levels: "Only games that released before Mario 64 are eligible"
- Memory management issues causing crashes with collision triangles

## Business Aspects
- Plans to stream daily for efficiency and income: "I'm gonna just stream like basically every day now"
- Currently on parental leave but working to supplement income
- Mentions potential sponsorship/gift giveaway from "some weeb gift shop thing"

## Key Quotes
- "I have officially lost my mind. I am actually working. On my major hack."
- "The thing is, every emulator is broken as fuck. It's just that I've been using this emulator because this one is the easiest one to use. And it has the best usability features. And I work around the bugs in this emulator."
- "Yes, it being Land 1 is non-negotiable. This will be a Land 1 level. Unless we push Land 1 to course 15, in which case you need to throw me a different game that we haven't covered yet. But Land 1 will happen for sure."
