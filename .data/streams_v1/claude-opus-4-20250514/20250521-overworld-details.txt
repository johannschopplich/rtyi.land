## Game Development Process
- Currently working on implementing shaders and fog effects for overworld areas
- Fixing old levels that broke due to engine updates: "these old levels are going to become a lot more playable soon because we broke them over time with engine updates"
- Goal for the stream: "make some progress in the overworld we want to finish the first round of adding shaders to this"
- Working toward getting repository into a state where a script can export everything: "I want to get my repository into a state where I can execute a script to export every break the whole repository"
- Creating interactive grape objects with collision and sound effects as gameplay elements

## Personal Insights
- Finds bug fixing enjoyable: "it's actually really fun to work on bug fixes for these"
- Values convenience in development tools: "dude I love this new system with the bitflex this is so convenient"
- Strong opinions on game quality, particularly critical of modern Pokemon games compared to Pokemon Stadium: "I will now refuse to play a Pokémon game until we get that quality again"
- Prefers proper implementation over quick fixes: demonstrates careful attention to fog implementation details
- Has high standards for analog controls in games, criticizing modern games for losing this technology

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: No relevant information found
- Biobak: No relevant information found  
- Zeina: Currently watching BNA anime together with Kaze
- Other Contributors:
  - Sarin: Created something significant for the retro section in the final level involving smooth music transitions: "sarin did the coolest thing ever for the retro section that I will not show you guys yet but it is so cool" - later explains it's "like breath of the wild ost...one song that smoothly transitions into different sections"
  - Mrs. Kaze: Working on Penguin Town for course 13

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Implementing fog effects that properly fade to white when approaching certain areas
- Working with shader systems and primitive color values for visual effects
- Creating physics-based grape objects with proper collision and "squishy sound effect"
- Dealing with technical constraints: "we have a lot of issues with decals now for some reason we didn't used to have those issues"
- Decision to remove all loops and turn them into ticks
- Careful consideration of visual-gameplay alignment: rejecting balance animation idea because "the visuals do not match the actual gameplay"

## Business Aspects
- Plans to upload video on Saturday
- Another video scheduled for "the 14th of next month"
- Brief mention of work schedule affecting streaming availability

## Key Quotes
- "these old levels are going to become a lot more playable soon because we broke them over time with engine updates so making them playable again is very cool"
- "so you guys know how breath of the wild ost is like it's like one song that smoothly transitions into different sections that's kind of what's all rendered and it is so cool"
- "somehow between the year 2003 and the year 2025 we have lost the technology to make good analog controls"

## Potential Interview Topics
- The evolution of the game engine and how updates have affected older content
- Sarin's innovative approach to dynamic music transitions in the retro section
- The philosophy behind maintaining high quality standards versus quick implementation
- The collaborative process with team members like Mrs. Kaze working on different areas
- Technical challenges in implementing atmospheric effects (fog, shaders) while maintaining performance on N64 hardware
