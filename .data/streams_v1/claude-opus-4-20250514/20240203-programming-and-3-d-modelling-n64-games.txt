## Game Development Process
- Major milestone: Rewriting Mario's entire collision system - "I had an idea yesterday to just rewrite Mario's collision entirely. What you're seeing right now is the rewritten collision. Still has a few issues, but I think it's already a lot better."
- Current progress: "We have like three and a half levels left, basically. We're in course 12 here."
- Testing insights: "another player play course five stemmer he kind of got stuck 50 minutes on something but it still took him 50 minutes for one course and there's 50 courses in this"
- Estimated runtime: "I could probably mention that this game has like a 10 to 12 hour runtime"
- Active course reorganization: "move wild west to the course 13 and across 12" to improve pacing

## Personal Insights
- On Mario 64's design: "I don't think Mario 64 is that great either, except for the movement design. Like the level design itself is not great, but the movement is like awesome. So that's the part I want to change."
- Work philosophy: "All I want to be is in my basement in silence, making Mario."
- Level design philosophy: "We don't want every level to feel like it's made for Mario. We want a lot of them to feel more like they are there and Mario is experiencing them"
- On past work: "I've heard people say that Madness is the only good hack I made because it has the most soul. Everything else after that is just like mainstream garbage, but Madness, it had soul."
- On Missing Link: "I agree, Missing Link is definitely one of the best. I did have help from CDI and Zelda, which really helped the project."

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: Music composer - "we also have baduk making a lot of music"
- Biobak: Graphics artist - "bio back is making a lot of stuff"
- Zeina: Animator and graphics contributor - "Yeah, Zeina made the animation and I just polished it up a little bit." Also creates textures and models (bulletin board, Koopa tie, etc.) and appears to live in the same house as Kaze
- Other Contributors: 
  - CDI: Helped with the Missing Link project
  - Zelda: Helped with the Missing Link project

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Spin jump animation choice: "What makes the most sense for the spin jump? Because I wanted a new animation. The twirl looked bad. And then I realized. The closest you have to an official version of the spin jump from 1996 is Mario's Down-B from Smash Melee."
- New collision system implementation: "now I'm switching to a whole new collision system which binary searches for the largest viable step along with a raycast to like speed up the search"
- Level variety philosophy: "There are levels with a strong character interactions there are levels with no character interactions and there's levels of story and levels with no story and We can have a mix of all four combinations"
- Player discovery focus: "I want players to seek out the hole, you know" (regarding the breakable boulder design)
- Auto-scaling text boxes: "it will automatically find the right size to encapsulate the text. That's cool, right?"

- "I don't think Mario 64 is that great either, except for the movement design. Like the level design itself is not great, but the movement is like awesome. So that's the part I want to change."
- "Once my new collision system is done, dude, this game will be so nice collision-wise, I think. Much better than any other Mario 64 thing."

## Potential Interview Topics
1. The philosophy behind creating levels that exist independently vs. levels "made for Mario" - how this affects player immersion and exploration
2. The technical innovation of the new collision system and how it improves upon the original Mario 64 engine
3. The collaborative workflow with remote team members (Badub, Biobak) and in-house collaboration with Zeina
4. The influence of Smash Bros Melee on gameplay decisions and how other Nintendo games inform the ROM hack design
5. The balance between maintaining Mario 64's movement excellence while completely reimagining level design philosophy
