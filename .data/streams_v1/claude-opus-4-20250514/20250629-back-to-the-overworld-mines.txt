## Game Development Process
- Multiple levels are being completed, with Kaze mentioning "I basically finished this level here off-screen" and "I finished this level literally earlier today"
- The project is in active development with "We're slowly getting done with part 1, which is great"
- Development includes both on-stream and off-stream work sessions
- The game engine has been developed to the point where it can be tested on real Nintendo 64 hardware
- Plans to implement additional features like "the sand form" which "is going to be very fun"

## Personal Insights
- Kaze expresses uncertainty about content reception: "I wasn't sure if people would enjoy that style of content" and "I wasn't sure if people would like me sharing game design things"
- Strong attachment to the enhanced movement system: "I can never go back to normal Mario 64 movement after this"
- Philosophy on work ethic: "if you need motivation, you're already fucked up. Why do you need to feel motivated to work? Are you stupid? Just work."
- Recognition of the need for artistic collaboration: "I feel like if we do that, I have to pay a lot of artists to make textures for us"
- Shows pride in the visual improvements: "all stars should do this instead, right. That looks so much better than a normal star animation"

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: Mentioned in context of implementing storybook features - "I'm sure Badoop can pull that up"
- Biobak: Appears as "Biomech" in the stream chat, actively participating and mentioned as uploading something to Discord
- Zeina: Mentioned briefly in chat context, appears to be in a bad mood during the stream
- Other Contributors:
  - Diablox: Level designer - "a lot of this is also Diablox work and not just my own"
  - ZeroVolt: Music implementation - "Fun fact, ZeroVolt converted this song here and put it in-game"
  - Pfizer: Thanked during the stream
  - Clayman: Active community member greeted during stream
  - Samuel and Michel: Community members/contributors mentioned

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Implementing innovative cutscene system: "imagine this is a 3D scene... then right here, it turns into, like, a storybook... But then the storybook alpha overlay disappears slowly to reveal the island below it in 3D"
- Enhanced star collection animations with particle effects: "shower Mario in pixie dust" instead of standard animations
- Creating a corrupt Bob-omb character that charges 200 coins for cannon access: "I'll let you use my cannon, but I want 200 coins from you"
- Technical optimizations including converting "all the 4x4 matrices finally into 4x3 matrices" for performance
- Dealing with memory constraints: "Ugh, that's half a megabyte. We might have to stream this from memory and then delete it"
- Bug fixing dialogue system that was broken during refactoring

## Business Aspects
- Current distribution: "I do have a getup account, and you can find all the versions of this engine on there without the RTY part"
- Open source plans: "But this right now is not open source yet. It will be open source though, once it's done"
- Copyright considerations: "we want to be copyright free at some point anyway, ideally"
- Potential need for commissioned artwork: "I have to pay a lot of artists to make textures for us"

## Key Quotes
- "I can never go back to normal Mario 64 movement after this" - Shows how the enhanced mechanics have fundamentally changed the game experience
- "if you need motivation, you're already fucked up. Why do you need to feel motivated to work? Are you stupid? Just work." - Reveals Kaze's no-nonsense approach to productivity
- "all stars should do this instead, right. That looks so much better than a normal star animation" - Demonstrates the focus on improving and modernizing classic Mario 64 elements

## Potential Interview Topics
1. The collaborative nature of the project - How did the team form and how are responsibilities divided between Kaze, Diablox, ZeroVolt, and others?
2. The decision to eventually go open source - What are the motivations and timeline for this release strategy?
3. Technical innovations and optimizations - What unique challenges did developing for actual N64 hardware present?
4. The vision for differentiating from vanilla Mario 64 - How do you balance nostalgia with innovation?
5. The storybook cutscene system - What inspired this mixed 2D/3D approach and how does it enhance the narrative?
