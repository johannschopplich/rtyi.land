## Game Development Process
- Currently working on a space colony level featuring agricultural/plantation elements with crops
- Iterative design approach: "I think it's better to just put together some gameplay first, and then plan the story around the gameplay you have. Because it's a Mario game."
- Performance testing on real N64 hardware showing 43 FPS for the current level
- Plans to open-source the game after completion: "I'm planning to open source this game anyway"
- Considering post-game content including potentially playing as Luigi
- Most development work will be refined by other team members: "Keep in mind when I make these, that most of this is going to be reworked by the debug anyway"

## Personal Insights
- Strong desire to elevate ROM hacks beyond fan projects: "I feel like right now, people don't respect ROM hack as like real games. Even ROM hack don't seem to do that. So I definitely want to change that."
- Goal to create a standalone experience: "I want to make sure that this ROM hack is also like playable as like a normal game without the context of Mario 64."
- Finds streaming development exhausting: "streaming is very exhausting, especially for someone with my personality type"
- Frustrated by ROM hackers' self-perception: "When I was talking to ROM hack yesterday, they seemed to think that the concept of like a ROM hack standing on its own legs is like completely frivolous and impossible. Which, dang, that's that's depressing"
- Contemplating a 30-day streaming marathon to develop a full Mario 64 hack as a fundraising concept

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Designing accessible platforming: "I don't want the player to do a jank jump like this"
- Avoiding required advanced techniques: "There's a lot of people that just can't do diagonal wall jumps, so I don't want that to ever be a required tech"
- Adding visual clarity through glowing borders on platforms for better readability
- Balancing speedrun strategies with casual player paths, showing multiple ways to complete sections
- Working on a space colony level with bumpers for movement and agricultural theming
- Ensuring clear visual boundaries: "The only thing we really need to make sure is that they don't overlap... and that the edges of the wind is like 100% clear"
- Debating whether to allow Mario to swim in water tanks within the level

## Business Aspects
- Proposed streaming marathon fundraising concept: "And like for every $1,000 of every $500 donated, we add an extra day of stream"
- Explicitly not for charity: "For charity? No. For my bank account"
- Plans to open-source the game, seeing no point in trying to prevent leaks
- No intention to sell the game commercially
- Discussion of Nintendo's relationship with ROM hacks as a business consideration

## Potential Interview Topics
1. The philosophy and challenges of elevating ROM hacks to be respected as legitimate games rather than just fan projects
2. The collaborative development process and how different team members (Dariel, Debug, texture artists) contribute to and refine the game
3. Design philosophy around accessibility vs. speedrun optimization - how to create levels that work for both casual players and advanced techniques
4. The decision to open-source the game and what that means for the ROM hacking community
5. The creative process behind designing original levels that feel cohesive within the Mario 64 framework while pushing boundaries (like the space colony concept)
