## Game Development Process
- The game is approximately 10% complete according to Kaze's estimate
- ROM size is just under 60MB
- Currently working on overworld design, specifically parts 5, 7, 8, 9, and 12
- The entire overworld is designed as one large interconnected level
- Development involves skipping sections temporarily to return later (currently skipping part 4)
- Multiple course entrances are being strategically placed throughout the overworld
- Using Mario 64 decompilation as the base engine with significant modifications

## Personal Insights
- Kaze wants "the whole island to feel like there's secrets around every corner"
- Expresses frustration with computers: "With computers you're just learning about things someone else made. You have to deal with someone else's systems. It's not like you're making new systems, you know. That's what I do."
- Philosophy on game design: "Let's start making based games again simpler games not just the Hey, let's throw six million dollars at it and make something very safe that is guaranteed to not be garbage type games. We'd be making risky games again"
- Shows dedication despite being sick: continues working while feeling "miserable" and "feverish"
- References personal life, mentioning making money for his family and his daughter

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: No relevant information found in this transcript
- Biobak: No relevant information found in this transcript  
- Zeina: Created drawings for overworld design elements. Kaze references reviewing "Zeina's drawings" for cave designs, though notes "doesn't really work, I do want it to be a cave"
- Other Contributors: 
  - ESA: Currently "working on a sleight level"
  - Mentions of unnamed collaborators who created prehistoric Yoshi designs for Course 6

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- River flow design: Decided to use a grate to prevent players from going through the river incorrectly
- Course 6 themed as "Jurassic Jungle" - "a prehistoric jungle level with ancient Yoshis"
- Created secret forest path connecting different areas for improved flow
- Struggling with flat beach areas: "This beach is depressing and sad. I can't leave it like this"
- Planning Yoshi houses in hub areas and sandcastle obstacle courses for blue coins
- Part 12 (volcano area) requires collecting "enough happiness on the island" to access via climbable tree
- Implementing special mechanics like prehistoric Yoshis with talons

## Business Aspects
- Multiple sponsorships secured: Manscaped, NordVPN, Squarespace, and Brilliant
- Legal constraints: "Are you asking if I'm gonna print cartridges and sell them? The answer is no because of legal issues"
- Distribution plan: "I'll just release this game online on my youtube channel"
- Financial motivation: "I gotta make money for my family"
- Failed monetization attempt: "I had hoped that I could make a little bit of money posting on Twitter. And that just did not happen"

## Key Quotes
- "I want the whole island to feel like there's secrets around every corner after all"
- "Yeah, it's the new overworld for Return to Yoshi's Island. We're making a huge overworld and this is all going to be one level"
- "Let's start making based games again simpler games not just the Hey, let's throw six million dollars at it and make something very safe that is guaranteed to not be garbage type games. We'd be making risky games again"

## Potential Interview Topics
1. The design philosophy of creating games with "secrets around every corner" and how this influences level design decisions
2. The technical challenges of modifying the Mario 64 engine and creating custom mechanics like the prehistoric Yoshis
3. Balancing creative vision with legal constraints - how does working within Nintendo's IP limitations shape the project?
4. The role of community and collaborators in development - how work is divided and creative decisions are made collectively
5. The business model of ROM hack development - navigating sponsorships, free distribution, and supporting a family through content creation
