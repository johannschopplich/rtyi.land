## Game Development Process
- The game has reached a significant milestone with "120 stars finished actually"
- Successfully implemented FBDX3 microcode achieving "basically like 50 FPS now" with room for further optimization
- Planning a limited demo release: "I'm planning a demo of just Course 1, only the first level. So everyone can play with the new camera and the new Mario controls"
- Currently working on UV mapping and texturing for course 13 (an ice/fridge themed castle level)
- The development appears to be in late stages with focus shifting to optimization and polish

## Personal Insights
- Design philosophy: "when I'm doing visuals, I don't really think about it in terms of like pleasure to look at. That's like secondary to me. For me, I think about it in first line about like emotions I want to invoke in the player"
- On the ice level atmosphere: "I want this to feel cold and mysterious. So blue is good"
- Personal circumstances affecting work: "I'm actually going to be trying to make a lot more money soon... now that I have a child, I need to make more money"
- Development approach: "I get a lot of people saying this is too difficult, and then I get a lot of people saying this is too easy"

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: No direct mentions in this transcript
- Biobak: Handles graphics improvements - "I know Biobak is gonna improve this a lot. Really at this point I have resigned myself to like knowing that whatever I do is just kind of like a suggestion for Biobak and he's gonna make it look a lot better"
- Zeina: Working on animations and outdoor area assets - "Zeina is making it right now. Or she's making assets for it" (referring to the outside area of course 13)
- Other Contributors: 
  - Sauron: Created the FBDX3 microcode that significantly improved performance
  - Rionna: Another developer mentioned as working with X3 microcode

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Memory constraints forcing design compromises: "we have an issue in this level. And that is we are running out of memory for collision triangles"
- Technical lighting bug: "When I get close to an additional light source, the ambient light just disappears. I couldn't figure it out at all"
- Level design incorporating multiple paths: "there's so many different ways to the castle"
- Star mission design: "Two stars are going to be related to the outside area. The first one is we're just going to have 8 Red Coins in the outside area"
- Performance optimization focus shifting from RDP to RSP: "we found out that RSP is actually the limiting factor. Now, if you actually optimize your game well"

## Business Aspects
- Content creation as revenue stream: "I'm planning to make a video about all the optimizations in Mario 64... And then after that, I want to make a video about the new demo"
- Financial pressures influencing decisions: "But it also means I might have to sell out a little bit, unfortunately. Let's see how much I have to sell out"
- No direct mention of game pricing or distribution plans
- Focus on YouTube content for monetization rather than direct game sales

## Key Quotes

- "I have resigned myself to like knowing that whatever I do is just kind of like a suggestion for Biobak and he's gonna make it look a lot better."
- "I get a lot of people saying this is too difficult, and then I get a lot of people saying this is too easy... and then I had simpleflips fail my hack like 15 times on something super simple that any noob could do"

## Potential Interview Topics
1. The emotional design philosophy - How does Kaze translate specific emotions into level design and visual choices?
2. Team collaboration dynamics - How does the iterative process work between Kaze's initial designs and the team's improvements?
3. Technical innovation and constraints - How have hardware limitations shaped creative decisions, and what breakthroughs (like FBDX3) have expanded possibilities?
4. Balancing difficulty - What's the design philosophy behind creating challenging but fair gameplay in a community with varying skill levels?
5. The impact of personal life on indie development - How has becoming a parent affected the development timeline and business decisions for the project?
