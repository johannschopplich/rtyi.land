## Game Development Process
- The game has 15 courses total, with course 15 being the last one
- Currently implementing a Mario Paint-style minigame where players paint Mario and get evaluated
- Near completion stage, working on final features and polish
- Still missing "two characters for the Yoshikons" before the course is complete
- Testing and iterating on game mechanics in real-time during streams

## Personal Insights
- "I don't like 2D platformers, like at all. I only like Yoshi's Island because... It has Yoshi in it and he makes cute sounds in the game"
- Prefers open world exploration over dungeons in games: "playing Twilight Princess, I realized that what I like in Zelda games is all the open world and exploration and not really the dungeons"
- Shows strong opinions about game design: "I will absolutely not add undo to this. It's still a game, guys. This is not an image editor. You fuck up, you lose your points"
- Considers RTYI as a stepping stone: "I'm planning to make indie games eventually"

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Implemented a Mario Paint minigame with scoring system that evaluates how accurately players color Mario
- Design philosophy against hand-holding: "I will absolutely not add undo to this... You fuck up, you lose your points"
- Technical challenges with emulator compatibility: "I tried to fix the RTYI crash, but we literally couldn't figure it out. It just doesn't work in parallel"
- Discovered hidden N64 memory potential: "The Nintendo 64 has around one megabyte of hidden memory... all the bytes on the N64 are nine bits"
- Created dynamic texture system for the painting feature

## Business Aspects
- Has sponsorship deals: "they're paying me to play roblox maybe I can do that on Sunday"
- Considering commercial release: "there is this idea of maybe asset swapping Return to Yoshi's Island when it's done and releasing it under my own IP, because the only vanilla actor I use in this game is Mario himself"
- Working on another game under NDA: "The game I'm working on is still not finished. And I'm under NDA. So I can't tell you. It's a very long-term project"

## Key Quotes
- "The Nintendo 64 has around one megabyte of hidden memory that you don't really use. But there's ways to use it... secretly, all the bytes on the N64 are nine bits."
- "When I made Trump 64 in 2016, you could do anything on the internet... But if I do the same thing in 2024 with the Trump 64 ROM hack, people will murder me."
- "I'm planning to make indie games eventually, there is this idea of maybe asset swapping Return to Yoshi's Island when it's done and releasing it under my own IP"

## Potential Interview Topics
- The technical innovations in RTYI, particularly the use of hidden N64 memory and dynamic texture systems
- How personal gaming preferences (particularly the love for Yoshi's Island despite disliking 2D platformers) influenced the game's design
- The decision-making process behind game difficulty and player agency (no undo feature philosophy)
- The transition from ROM hacking to potential indie game development and the legal/creative considerations
- The collaborative process with team members like Zeina and how their contributions shaped the final product
