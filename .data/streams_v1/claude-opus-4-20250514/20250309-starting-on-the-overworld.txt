## Game Development Process
- All 15 main courses are complete; current focus is on overworld design, side levels, and Biobak's level reworks
- Development follows iterative approach: "We're going to first get a rough draft of all 15 overworld areas. And then after we have the rough draft, we are going to be moving on to making them look nice"
- Beta testing planned to start soon with 5 initial testers, expanding gradually
- The overworld will have 15 interconnected areas, more similar to Banjo-Kazooie than Mario 64
- Another game "Direct Mario" is basically done and entering beta testing phase

## Personal Insights
- "I think the overworld is the most important part of the game. So we're putting a lot of care into this"
- "I do not like developing games that I personally wouldn't enjoy so I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing"
- Strong design philosophy about player guidance: "if a player is disappointed that a feature isn't present, even though it looks like it could be present, then I have to make the feature present"
- Values creating intrigue without frustration: "I want the player to feel kind of stuck at first and don't know how to get the first star"

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: No specific mentions in this transcript
- Biobak: "Yes, Biobak is reworking all the levels and I have to pay him a lot for that" - handling major level redesigns
- Zeina: No specific mentions in this transcript
- Other Contributors: 
  - Unnamed video editor (paid position for YouTube content)
  - Bingos: Potentially creating ports using Wiseguy's recompilation
  - Music composers: Planning to "buy the rights for the music at the end and then make an OST cartridge"

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Major focus on preventing empty stretches: "I still don't like that there's such a long empty stretch here"
- Implementing tutorial elements naturally: Planning a Cheep Cheep character holding a sign to teach swimming controls
- Designing first area to build intrigue: "The goal for the first overworld here right now is just to build intrigue in the player to Ignite the desire in the player to want to explore the next part"
- Debating how to block Course 1 entrance: Considering Pachyderm enemy, coin collection requirement, or knowledge-based barrier
- Technical innovation: New randomization system that creates "true noise" making the game potentially impossible to TAS

## Business Aspects
- "The game as a whole is going to cost me in the tens of thousands, just so you guys know. Maybe I will start a donation drive for that or something"
- "I have an editor now. And I need to pay the editor"
- Considering commercial release: "There's a consideration to strip this off copyright stuff and, like, put it out as a PC game as well. So, like, everyone can just play it without needing an emulator"
- Waiting on sponsorships for YouTube videos to fund development
- Planning to create and sell an OST cartridge after securing music rights

## Key Quotes
- "The overworld is going to be very interconnected. And another thing that's going to happen is there's a secret exit from a different overworld here that you can come out from"
- "I made a new random function that is faster than the one used in vanilla Mario 64... it kind of uses like true noise on accident so it may be impossible to TAS this game"
- "Well, it's fair, Sour, because I also have a Patreon and a YouTube channel, so I do make some money. There is money to be made, I'm not making it up at all"

## Potential Interview Topics
- The financial evolution from hobbyist ROM hacking to managing a project costing "tens of thousands" of dollars
- The design philosophy behind making the overworld "the most important part of the game" and how this differs from traditional Mario 64 design
- The technical innovation of the new randomization system and its implications for speedrunning/TAS communities
- The decision-making process for potentially releasing as an original PC game and navigating copyright considerations
- The challenges and benefits of working with paid collaborators versus the traditional volunteer-based ROM hacking model
