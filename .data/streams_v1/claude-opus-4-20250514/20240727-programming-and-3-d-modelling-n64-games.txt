## Game Development Process
- Project is in late development stages: "I almost finished my to-do list regarding bugs and performance issues"
- Currently working on course 13 (ice level), with only 2 levels remaining after this: "I hope I can finish this level in the next month or so and then it's just two levels missing"
- Extensive bug fixing and performance optimization phase: "Over the last week or so, I did a lot of bug fixing here. And I found so many small improvements doing that, too. Minuscule performance tweaks"
- Game size will be under 64 megabytes
- Real-time testing on actual N64 hardware is part of the workflow: "All I have to do to test this on the N64 is hit this button here"

## Personal Insights
- Strong artistic philosophy: "I think a better way is you think about what feeling do I want to create and then you look at your tools and you look at how you can use your tools to create that feeling"
- Rejects traditional art principles: "You don't want to operate on principles because if you operate on principles, you make art for critics, you don't make art for the sake of it being experienced"
- Deep personal investment in the project: "Yes, somehow I'm more proud of this than of the child. What can I say? I'm an artist"
- Recently became a father (daughter named Reyna, 5 days old)
- Working on a video about "how being humble is stupid"

## Collaborator Information

- Biobak: Created the model for fuzzies wearing protective gear: "This was Biobak's idea and Biobak made the model"
- Zeina: Kaze's partner, recently gave birth, mentioned as being "always in chat" but not specifically for animation work in this stream
- Other Contributors: 
  - Unnamed video editor working on render matrices video
  - Nathaniel: F3 event host
  - SimbaFlips: F3 presenter

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Achieved infinite render distance on N64 in certain levels: "Yep, infinite render distance on N64 in this level"
- Camera issues in large areas: "I think this level is a little too big and that's why the camera does this. It usually does that when you have a really big area"
- Anti-aliasing feature implemented on N64: "When you want anti-aliasing, there you go. Now the game is anti-aliased"
- Dynamic music system that changes based on player location: "I love that the music does that"
- Performance targets: achieving 45-60 FPS with anti-aliasing enabled
- Bowser office area with custom music (not yet implemented)

## Business Aspects
- Cannot sell physical cartridges due to legal restrictions: "I am not allowed to sell real cartridges, so I can't do that"
- Plans to create merchandise without Nintendo references: "But what I am planning to do is make a box and a book inlet without any Nintendo references to it and put that out so you can at least get the box as a souvenir"
- Expects illegal cartridge manufacturing by third parties: "And I'm sure there will be illegally manufactured cartridges by other people"
- F3 event serves as free marketing for fan games: "We want to provide free marketing"
- Addresses CND (Cease and Desist) concerns: "Also, you won't get CND'd most likely unless your game gets really, really popular"

## Key Quotes
- "I have a very different approach, which maybe that's why my stuff stands out a little bit. Usually when you learn art, there's a lot of principles you learn... I think that's a really, really poor approach and a very dateable approach as in your thing will be outdated very quickly."
- "When you have to sell well, you have to make something somewhat bland. I think maybe that is why you are looking forward to ROM hack a little more."
- "This is what the N64 games could have looked like. You were robbed."
