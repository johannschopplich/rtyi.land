## Game Development Process
- Currently implementing and testing Whomp enemies with custom animations and behaviors for a construction/factory level
- Actively debugging N64 hardware compatibility issues during stream ("There's a crash in this function here on n64 only")
- Making progress on the first star/mission which involves players disrupting five different worker characters
- Optimizing ROM size to stay under constraints ("RQMIO is still below 43 megabytes and I have found a lot of size optimization I have to apply soon")
- Planning to release on "the 30th" which appears to be a deadline for "someone's competition"
- Mentions upcoming releases: "there's going to be F3 and I'm going to release only up 64. So that's two videos I'm going to upload and both are like within the next month"

## Personal Insights
- On game difficulty philosophy: "I actually believe that difficulty in a game is not a thing you should strive for instead you should strive for having cool platforming and sometimes the cool platforming just so will happen to require something more difficult to do"
- On hint design: "I like six layers of protection and everyone was bound to find one of them... none of the hints were overbearing right if you found one of them And figured it out from just one hint you'd be like, oh my god I'm so smart"
- Mentions being a professional Unreal Engine developer: "I'm literally a professional unreal engine developer"
- On platform choice: "I couldn't stand Twitch anymore... it's nice having this all be in one place"
- Shows awareness of player psychology: "if you've ever made a ROM hack where you put a star and right next to the star there's a red coin... I want you to know that I hate you on a personal level"

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: Music composer who "wrote me again today. He's back and he's making music again. He said he was looking into a song for this level... he said he's been working on it for a week and he said like 10 different tries and he just can't figure out how To make a good But he's really putting in the effort"
- Biobak: Not mentioned in this transcript
- Zeina: Animator actively working during the stream, created Whomp animations (idle, falling) and Koopa animations (talking, angry). Kaze mentions "Zeina's working on it right now, so I cannot do that"
- Other Contributors: 
  - "Lila" appears to be present/watching the stream and provides feedback
  - References to an AI music generation system being used for some tracks: "the OST for this is literally AI generated Lofi"

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Implementing a comedic mission where players disrupt construction workers: cement pit disruption, glass carriers, lunch break Goomba, oil barrel, and Whomp tower
- Wrestling with player communication: "how's the player for the first mission gonna figure out to mess with all these characters"
- Solution involves multiple hint layers including an overseer character who mentions workers wearing "Bowser helmets"
- Design philosophy of "show don't tell" while ensuring players understand objectives
- Performance concerns: "I Have the one concern that maybe there's a bit too many ones [Womps] to render them properly"
- Decided workers should be "rude to Mario" to incentivize players disrupting them

## Business Aspects
- Target release date mentioned as "the 30th" for a competition deadline
- ROM size optimization to allow more space for music: "the smaller the ROM is The more space we're gonna for mp3 files"
- Discusses potential multiplayer feature as an optional toggle
- No direct mention of funding or marketing strategies
- References upcoming video content for main channel

## Key Quotes
- "I like six layers of protection and everyone was bound to find one of them... none of the hints were overbearing right if you found one of them And figured it out from just one hint you'd be like, oh my god I'm so smart and everyone's gonna figure out from the first and they actually get and I think that's great"
- "difficulty in a game is not a thing you should strive for instead you should strive for having cool platforming and sometimes the cool platforming just so will happen to require something more difficult to do"
- "Video game graphics are all about faking everything Nothing that we do is how light works in real life"

## Potential Interview Topics
1. The collaborative process with remote team members (especially real-time animation work with Zeina) and how it impacts development workflow
2. The philosophy behind multi-layered hint systems and player communication without being "overbearing"
3. Technical challenges of optimizing for N64 hardware while pushing boundaries with modern ROM hacking techniques
4. The decision to use AI-generated music alongside human composers and how that fits into the overall audio design
5. The balance between comedy/personality in level design versus traditional platforming challenges
