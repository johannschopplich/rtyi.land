## Game Development Process
- The project is in its final stretch with 15 courses completed: "Complete this game so far, we have 15 courses done. And now we're doing the overworld, and then a couple more side levels. So I think it would be fair to say that this is like a final stretch, I guess."
- Currently working on Part 2 of the overworld, which connects Part 1 and Part 3
- Post-completion plans include additional polishing: "Even after this game is technically complete, there is still going to be more that I want to do to it. It being content complete does not mean that I will instantly release it."
- Strategic release timing is being considered due to Nintendo concerns: "I will still need to... Find a good moment in time to actually release it, because I don't want Nintendo to instantly kill me."

## Personal Insights
- On game design education: "I think studying game design is relatively pointless, because game design is such a new art that basically all the research that's been done on it so far amounts to basically nothing. It's like physics before the ancient Greeks."
- Shows conflicted feelings about Nintendo IP: "I'm half hoping Nintendo shuts me down. So I have to exchange all the assets for non-Nintendo assets. So I can actually sell it."
- Design philosophy favoring player freedom: "I don't want to put fake barriers there. If you find a way around it, be my guest. I don't want to be a bus kill."
- Technical achievement: "My engine actually doesn't have invisible walls anymore. Unless there's legitimately no level boundary... I reworked how Mario handles collision altogether."

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Major challenge connecting overworld sections after first Bowser defeat: Initially considered having Yoshis repair a bridge for 100 coins but rejected this as inconsistent with their character
- Solution involved using Dorrie (chained in a lake) as transportation after Yoshis free her: "So Dorrie chained to a wall in the lake. After beating the first Bowser, the Yoshi is on Dorrie's back. When you talk to him, he says he freed her from his mighty behind."
- Design philosophy against artificial barriers: "I'm not a fan of trying to prevent cheese that much. If you can get there, it should just work."
- Consideration of player perspective in camera framing while maintaining player control freedom

## Business Aspects
- Squarespace sponsorship deal: "I recently took a sponsor deal with Squarespace. And they're asking me to make 6 videos in 3 months... It's way too much money to not take it."
- Free distribution model: "You will be able to just download this game for free. I can't charge for this because it's not my IP."
- Considering commission store: "I was thinking of opening a store for commission models because so many people ask me and I always forward them to Aesir"
- Nintendo legal concerns influence development: Notes that he received "the most legal attention" when not monetizing content
- Potential PC port via "ViceGuy's static recompilation" if needed

## Key Quotes
- "I think studying game design is relatively pointless, because game design is such a new art that basically all the research that's been done on it so far amounts to basically nothing. It's like physics before the ancient Greeks."
- "I'm half hoping Nintendo shuts me down. So I have to exchange all the assets for non-Nintendo assets. So I can actually sell it."
- "Camera framing is difficult, because I don't want to take away camera control from the player. I want the player to have full freedom. But also I want the scenes to look cool."

## Potential Interview Topics
- The evolution of the game engine and elimination of invisible walls - technical achievements and design philosophy
- The tension between creating Nintendo fan content and desire for commercial viability - navigating legal concerns
- Collaborative workflow and delegation (particularly the model commission system with Aesir)
- Design philosophy balancing player freedom with intended experiences - specific examples from overworld design
- The impact of content creation/sponsorships on development timeline and priorities
