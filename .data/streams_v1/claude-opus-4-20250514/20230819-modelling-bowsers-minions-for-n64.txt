## Game Development Process
- Currently working on a Bowser level featuring industrial/oil rig themes with cranes and oil-based enemies ("oil whomps")
- Testing reveals the game maintains stable 30 FPS on real N64 hardware even without optimization ("we were in 64 testing this level and it already hit 30 FPS")
- The ROM hack "RTYI is so stable on the N64" showing significant progress in stability
- Development involves iterative testing between emulator and real hardware
- Working on background/skybox implementation to create sense of vast ocean environment
- Level currently has "8000 polygon level" with "no render areas" and triangles not yet sorted for optimization

## Personal Insights
- "my favorite one is always the most recent level I made" - shows enthusiasm for current work
- Expresses frustration with technical limitations: "I think the idea is fundamentally wrong" (regarding background rendering approach)
- Shows perfectionist tendencies: "I think this level is missing something. I Think it's missing a lot of coins that we put everywhere"
- Demonstrates problem-solving mindset when facing rendering challenges
- Values community input but maintains creative control

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: Not mentioned in this transcript
- Biobak: Contributed graphics suggestions including "different color per crane" concept and provided a "purple floor switch" 3D model
- Zeina: Responsible for animations; was absent during this stream ("Unfortunately Xena's gone today. Otherwise, she maybe would have finished the animation for the guy here")
- Other Contributors: 
  - Lila: Active community member providing technical feedback on smooth shading and rendering
  - Bio/Biobak: 3D modeling contributor who created improved switch model
  - Wiseguy: Created "Matrix Stack Fix" technical solution used in the project

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Struggling with ocean background rendering to achieve sense of vastness without hitting hardware limitations
- "An nfbg doesn't work if the elements in your level are touching the background" - discovered limitation
- Implemented colored cranes for visual variety and player guidance
- Added "oil whomps" as thematic enemy variants
- Balancing visual quality with N64 performance constraints ("this is already a pretty tough level to render")
- Decided against certain rendering techniques due to computational expense

## Business Aspects
- Exploring merchandise opportunities: "a merch company has written me... we can make N64 boxes and sell those as merch"
- Legal distribution strategy: "when I sell RTYI, I could just sell the box without the ROM, and it'd be legal"
- Plans to compensate collaborators: "I was offering to pay the musicians as well, for like the rights to the music, once everything's done"
- Considering hiring if merchandise succeeds: "maybe I'm gonna start hiring people"
- Discussed Twitter monetization but determined requirements too high (5 million impressions)

## Key Quotes
- "And now RTYI is so stable on the N64" - highlighting technical achievement
- "I think everyone here just gets smarter by watching me" - showing personality and community engagement
- "An nfbg doesn't work if the elements in your level are touching the background" - technical discovery that shapes design decisions

## Potential Interview Topics
- The decision-making process for prioritizing real N64 hardware compatibility over emulator-only features
- How community feedback is integrated into the development process while maintaining creative vision
- Technical innovations developed to push N64 hardware beyond original capabilities
- The collaborative process with remote team members and managing asynchronous contributions
- Business model considerations for ROM hack distribution and monetization through merchandise
