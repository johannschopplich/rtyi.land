## Game Development Process
- The game is in a mature development stage with engine upgrades "basically done"
- Currently focused on asset import and integration of team members' work
- Overworld development is complete and level work is progressing
- Working within strict technical constraints: approaching 64MB ROM limit and dealing with memory management issues
- Implemented new collision system to improve player experience: "I tried to make collision nearly continuous. I have a whole new collision routine."
- Added gameplay refinements like rubber banding to the egg chase sequence: "the egg now has some level of rubber banding, so it gets faster as you go further ahead, which keeps this exciting"

## Personal Insights
- Strong philosophy about removing technical complexity from player awareness: "I want to remove quarter frame precision from the player's mind. Like, I don't want the player to think about their quarter frames when they play my game."
- Feels pressure to work primarily on stream for transparency: "I feel pressured to only work on this on stream so you can know exactly what I'm doing. Because otherwise I probably would have finished this by now."
- Committed to working within original N64 constraints: "if you go beyond 64 megabytes you're going beyond what the original Nintendo 64 developers worked with and like that just feels like cheating"
- Takes pride in technical solutions: "This is actually a thing I'm really proud of" (referring to collision improvements)

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: Composer (mentioned but not actively discussed in this stream)
- Biobak: Graphics artist creating models including Yoshi, apples, and various level assets. Works with vertex colors and specific texture constraints. Kaze often has to adapt Biobak's artistic vision to technical requirements.
- Zeina: Animator working on character models and animations, specifically mentioned for shy guy models and redesigns: "he reworked all the shy guys"
- Other Contributors: No additional contributors explicitly mentioned

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Major collision system overhaul to eliminate randomness in Mario's movement and make behavior consistent
- Memory optimization challenges: "I think we're out of RAM again" - solved by moving assets to emergency memory pool
- Balancing artistic vision with technical constraints: implementing real-time CPU-computed shadows on apple to satisfy both Biobak's vertex color preference and need for dynamic lighting
- Maintaining 60 FPS while adding complex features
- Working within N64's "hard limit of 60" FPS and original memory constraints

## Business Aspects
- Merchandise integration issues: "TeePublic was supposed to link my new merch store to YouTube like two days ago, but they still haven't"
- Planning for "F3" event participation
- Content creation considerations for YouTube algorithm
- No specific mention of funding or release plans

## Key Quotes
- "I want to remove quarter frame precision from the player's mind. Like, I don't want the player to think about their quarter frames when they play my game. So, I tried to make collision nearly continuous."
- "Because Biobak wants his vertex colors on the apple, and I want my shadows on the apple. So we compromise by computing the fucking shadows on the CPU in real time."
- "if you go beyond 64 megabytes you're going beyond what the original Nintendo 64 developers worked with and like that just feels like cheating"

## Potential Interview Topics
- The philosophy and technical implementation behind removing "quarter frame precision" from the player experience - how this improves upon original Mario 64
- The collaborative process between programmer and artists when working within severe N64 hardware constraints
- The decision to maintain original N64 limitations (64MB ROM, memory constraints) as a creative challenge rather than using modern enhancements
- The impact of public development through streaming on productivity, transparency, and community engagement
- How the team balances artistic vision with technical requirements, using specific examples like the real-time shadow computation on the apple
