## Game Development Process
- The game is nearing completion with 10 courses already done and 4 more to go after the current one: "So how many levels until complete? Four after this."
- Currently working on the 11th course, which is an oil rig level: "And that's the 11th course, we have like 10 of these already done."
- Development appears iterative with constant testing: "We got the glass done, now we just need this guy done and the first star will be finished."
- Also finished another project called "Only Up 64" that releases the next day: "I finished making only up 64 it's releasing tomorrow"
- Plans to showcase at F3 event in two weeks: "f3 is in two weeks the submission deadline ends tomorrow"

## Personal Insights
- Reflects on growth as a developer compared to previous project: "back when i was making last impact i was just like whenever i had an idea i would just put it in almost like unfiltered and i would definitely like think more about what actually is worth putting in"
- Acknowledges past mistakes in development process: "when i made last impact i spent like maybe 10 no 5 of the time designing and like 95 of the time working but i should have been spending at least 20 of the time designing"
- Shows concern for player experience and intuitive design: "But I think kicking the oil barrel is not intuitive and also that's not very funny. So I'm not really a fan of that."
- Values comedy in game design: "I think oil guy is gone... Who would think to do that? ... I think these are just too cryptic."

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: Composer working on the soundtrack. "Badoop made a soundtrack for this level. It's not finished yet but he has some pretty good ideas." Working on music that should sound "grimy but also kind of comedic"
- Biobak: Graphics artist not present during stream, but mentioned in jest about an "Andrew Tate theme song"
- Zeina: Animator present during the stream, working on baby penguin animations. "I'm just helping out with animations. And anything else that he needs." Described as having made "very expressive" animations for the Koopas
- Other Contributors: 
  - Zero Volt/Zero World: "zero world is making music right now for one of the 8-bit sections in this game"

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Glass breaking mechanic design: "I think we should just have two pieces like this and then you kick it and then just kind of splits like this it falls over and to kind of spin away and that's it."
- Removing unintuitive mechanics: "But I think kicking the oil barrel is not intuitive and also that's not very funny. So I'm not really a fan of that."
- Technical constraints with polygon budget: "876. 846. 844. I mean, 240 polygons is just the hats. I think that's just too much. I think we can't do this."
- Added wing cap as optional bonus: "we're just gonna add a wing cap, just for the fun of it. Not required for anything."
- Focus on making NPCs interactable with comedic dialogue after player actions

## Business Aspects
- Submission to F3 showcase event: "f3 is in two weeks the submission deadline ends tomorrow after that I'm gonna look at all the trailers again"
- Participation in competitions for monetary prizes: "I made it for the simflips troll like competition it's not really that much of a troll heck but like free money you know"
- Working relationship with Gears for Breakfast (Hat in Time developer) mentioned by community member
- Receives free hardware from manufacturers for testing: "I often get emails from like Chinese manufacturers that I like oh you want you want to try this thing for free"

## Key Quotes
- "I would definitely like think more about what actually is worth putting in and less like just put stuff in you know"
- "Having the first mission done is gonna feel so huge"
- "That's the kind of stupid things that keep Mario 64 still like somewhat relevant in today"

## Potential Interview Topics

- The collaborative process with remote team members and how work is coordinated across different specialties
- Balancing technical constraints (polygon budgets, N64 hardware limitations) with creative vision
- The role of comedy and player trolling in the game's design philosophy
- Community engagement through tutorials and how it influences development decisions
