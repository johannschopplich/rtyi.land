## Game Development Process
- Currently working on Course 12 out of 15 total courses, specifically developing a mine area that serves as the Goomba gang's hideout
- Made significant restructures to Course 12 after realizing "the course is not very good" - showing iterative development approach
- Implementing complex features like a Western-style shootout cutscene with Boshi character: "there's gonna be a countdown and you have to press B before he does to kill him"
- Working on minecart mechanics for platforming sequences
- Dealing with technical challenges including compiler warnings and emulator compatibility issues

## Personal Insights
- Strong design philosophy against waiting-based boss fights: "I think boss gameplay is always boring. I think I can only enjoy bosses as set pieces"
- Preference for creative freedom in game design: "I feel like that would go hard and tell me if you like my idea"
- Critical view of modern Nintendo games: "I think they're kind of shut out of their former selves they make far fewer games"
- Values player flow and interconnectedness in level design: "I feel like there needs to be a way to go from here to here"
- Admits to creative blocks: "we only have six red coins and I'm out of creative ideas for this area"

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges

- Implementing unique Wild West theme with bandit Goombas using cork guns
- Struggling with red coin placement to ensure good level flow: "from here, the only way you can go is back here, where you came from. And I don't like that"

- Using wobbly platforms and minecart mechanics to create dynamic platforming
- Bootless red coin stars implemented for smoother gameplay flow

## Key Quotes
- "I think boss gameplay is always boring. I think I can only enjoy bosses as set pieces. Unless the gameplay is basically just not even boss gameplay."
- "Because I thought about it and I realized the course is not very good. And I think now it is good."
- "I'm able to 3D model, unlike most normal level designers would be able to, I guess. I can just make any shape I want."
