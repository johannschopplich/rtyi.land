## Game Development Process
- The overworld consists of 15 parts total, with work currently focused on the first part and planning for the second
- The game engine has been extensively customized - Kaze states "almost all of this engine here is my engine at this point. The only really thing that's still left from the vanilla 64 is Mario's physics"
- Major technical milestone: Custom implementations include rendering system for coins, quaternion-based animations instead of Euler angles, completely custom camera code, and custom collision functions
- Currently implementing complex fog effects for Course 4 (ghost ship level) using distance and angle-based calculations
- Active beta testing phase for another project (Drug Boss Mario) indicates Kaze manages multiple projects simultaneously

## Personal Insights
- "Sometimes I feel like I'm getting older and my brain doesn't work like it used to anymore. And then I also think that maybe my neurons just got more optimized and less variable" - reflects on cognitive changes and specialization
- "I think only really bad programmers care about which programming language they use for most applications" - shows pragmatic approach to development tools
- "But to be honest, I'm feeling a little burned out at this point. I've been going for a while. And it is technically my day off" - reveals the demanding nature of the development process
- Expresses frustration with software quality: "Why are there so many dogshit programmers working on all this software?" (regarding NVIDIA Broadcast and OBS crashes)

## Collaborator Information

- Biobak: Mentioned as working on overworld rework - "I'd like to see the Biobak rework of the overworld"
- Zeina: Briefly mentioned but no specific contribution details provided in this transcript
- Other Contributors:
  - Voicel: Beta tester for Drug Boss Mario, reported having "five hours in it" and finding it "really fun"
  - Rovard: Beta tester for Drug Boss Mario
  - Mushi: Working on Mario 64 Madness remake, described as someone Kaze has known for a long time

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Implementing a lighthouse mechanic where players must activate a light to clear fog and access the ghost ship level: "you're going to have to make your way through the overworld to the lighthouse and you go up the lighthouse and you turn the light and the light shines... and then the fog disappears"
- Struggling with coin placement to make collection easier without compromising level design: "We need a way to get more coins in your world before we move on to the second part. And I like these to be easy to collect"
- Technical challenge of creating volumetric fog on N64 hardware: "it's very difficult to make volumetric looking fog on the N64"
- Design philosophy emphasizing contrast: "sometimes the part that people least like about the game are also the parts that are most necessary to make the game's design work"
- Using natural barriers (giant fruit, bananas, trees) instead of cliffs to create more visually interesting boundaries

## Business Aspects
- Return to Yoshi's Island is a passion project done for free: "this one here is not any paid work at all this is just me working because of passion so it needs to be free too"
- Drug Boss Mario is a commissioned project: "the drug maury one is also commissioned someone paid me to make that there's a lot of money to me made in romhacking"
- Careful management of beta testing to prevent leaks: "Please understand that during the first beta testing, I'm only going to accept people that have been here for a long time because I want to minimize the chance of leaks"
- Consideration of legal issues for potential commercial release: "if i wanted this to be like legally sellable i would have to update the sound engine... i would have to change out mario and the sound engine"

## Key Quotes
- "what you probably don't realize is that like almost all of this engine here is my engine at this point" - highlighting the extensive customization work
- "sometimes the part that people least like about the game are also the parts that are most necessary to make the game's design work" - revealing design philosophy
- "there's a lot of money to me made in romhacking but this one here is not any paid work at all this is just me working because of passion" - showing the balance between commercial and passion projects

## Potential Interview Topics
1. The evolution of the custom engine - how did the project transform from a ROM hack to an almost entirely new engine?
2. Balancing passion projects with commissioned work - how does working on paid projects affect the development of Return to Yoshi's Island?
3. The creative process behind the fog/lighthouse mechanic - what inspired this non-linear puzzle design where players unlock earlier content later in the game?
4. Community involvement and beta testing strategies - how does community feedback shape the development process?
5. Technical innovation within N64 limitations - what drives the push to create effects like volumetric fog on limited hardware?
