## Game Development Process
- Overall progress: "We have 12 levels done" with "120 stars are finished now, but then we want 20 more stars"
- Current focus on creating NPCs for a Western-themed level with cowboy attire (shy guys, Monty Moles, Toads, Yoshis)
- Near completion: "We need to do some overworld stuff still. But almost everything is there"
- Rapid development pace: "That's actually insane dude. We started on this level like 2 weeks ago and we already have the first mission done. This is gonna be like the fastest developed level yet"
- Working on level naming: considering "Grand Sand Badlands" among other Western-themed names

## Personal Insights
- Work ethic philosophy: "I actually never suffer from burnout. And that's because I do not have a soul. I'm literally just a robot. I just make game. I just don't stop."
- Creative vision: "I think all the stars in this game. No, I don't want that. I want to tell stories in this game"
- Self-assessment of improvement: "I feel like recently I have a leveled up a lot of my skills and this level is like the first one that has those applied and I'm pretty happy with it"
- On motivation: "If you rely on motivation it's not gonna work. You just have to do the thing regardless of whether you want to or not. It's really that simple."
- Quality focus: "How long it takes me to make a hack is entirely dependent on how big the hack is and how high quality I want the hack to be"

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: No relevant information found in this transcript
- Biobak: Working on pipe model ("I'll send you the pipe model"), sent various assets during stream
- Zeina: Created dragon model for the level ("Zeina made the dragon, by the way"), actively making NPC models during stream including Goomba heads, working on Yoshi heads
- Other Contributors: 
  - Silas: Working on reworking the "squishiness function" - "Silas said he wanted to rework the squishiness function. He said he had a cool idea. So I'm waiting for that to finish"
  - Mio Mike: Received pipe model from Kaze

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Thematic consistency: "I do want all the stars to be about outlaws...that has more of a Wild West vibe to me"
- Content appropriateness: "We might have to slightly reshape the story the whole Yoshi slave labor plot is maybe a bit too dark"
- Performance optimization: "f3dx3...it decreased FPS by 20%" leading to decision not to use it
- Level design philosophy: Multiple boss fights in one level as "a very stylish choice for a Western level" (unusual as "most levels actually have zero")
- Family-friendly adaptations: "Everyone in this game is gonna just be drinking milk. We have to keep this like pg-8"
- Environmental storytelling: Train station area designed for a shootout with "five Goombas in a trench coat" who committed a train robbery

## Business Aspects
- Multi-platform streaming: "I'm on Twitch and YouTube...Because Twitch changed the rules recently, so now you're allowed to stream on both at the same time"
- Awareness of potential legal issues: "How fast do you think we would get shut down by Nintendo if you made the roaming Academy"
- Hardware compatibility focus: "Yeah, of course this runs on real hardware. What do you think I do all the optimization for, for emulator?"

## Key Quotes
- "It's very thematic everything is purposeful and I like that a lot"
- "I want to tell stories in this game"
- "That's what 2 weeks of vacation do" (referring to rapid development progress)

## Potential Interview Topics
1. The evolution of Kaze's skill set and how it manifested in the Western level design
2. The collaborative process with team members like Zeina and how assets are integrated into the game
3. Balancing creative vision with technical limitations (F3DX3 performance issues, optimization for N64 hardware)
4. The decision-making process for content appropriateness and narrative tone in a family-friendly ROM hack
5. The role of community engagement through streaming in the development process and how it influences design decisions
