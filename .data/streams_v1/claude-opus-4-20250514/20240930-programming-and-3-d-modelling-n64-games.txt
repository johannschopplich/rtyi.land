## Game Development Process
- Currently working on Course 14, with Course 15 ("Halloween of Ardor") already halfway complete
- Planning to create 15 total courses for the game
- Course 1 has undergone multiple major reworks - Kaze mentions "my weekly course one rework" and estimates only 7% of total development time has been spent on it despite the frequent revisions
- Game is designed to run on actual Nintendo 64 hardware: "Can this run on Nintendo 64? Of course. That's the whole point of this."
- Development includes both on-stream and off-stream work, with Kaze showing enemies created between streams

## Personal Insights
- Shows perfectionist tendencies: "i'm still thinking about the perfect name though i mean okay the names are good enough but i don't exclude the possibility that there's an even better one"
- Expresses frustration with release pressure from fans: "Please release before Christmas. Please, case. Please. Please shut the fuck up. Leave me be. Sorry."
- References his rapid development capabilities: "if you didn't know, Peach's Fury was made entirely in a single week"
- Values creative control while accepting input: "i do what i want" when asked about streaming permissions

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: No relevant information found in this transcript
- Biobak: Sent Course 1 rework update during stream, made extensive visual improvements including castle redesign, added depth to environments, improved lighting, changed textures, added roofs and architectural details. Also mentioned as "Biobak" or "Biobak" in chat
- Zeina: Mentioned as "Zeina" who offered to create red banners for the castle area: "Zeina says the farm will offer her to make a red banner"
- Other Contributors: Various community members in chat suggesting names for levels (paper craft peaks, handmade heights) and providing feedback during development

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Implementing paper/cardboard aesthetic throughout: Creating thwomps that look "like construction paper" with googly eyes that bounce around
- Game structure is "sandboxy" with "open like a Mario 64 world" but "instead of finding stars you find entrances to either like linear challenges or like puzzles"
- Plot reconsideration: "First, the plot was Bowser goes to Yoshi's Island and captures all the Yoshis and makes them work for him. But a whole slavery plot is maybe a bit too much for a Mario game"
- No strict polygon limits but conscious of performance: "I don't really have a polygon limit, but 164 is pretty good. We have some enemies with like 300, we have others that are like 60"
- Technical challenges with materials, rendering order, and lighting that require careful troubleshooting

## Business Aspects
- Mentions potential paid project: "someone on Twitter like he brought me. He wanted this. He wanted to pay me for it. I don't know if he actually will pay me for it. But if he does. I will do it." (referring to a Mario Party 64-inspired project)
- No specific release date or marketing strategy discussed
- Focus on quality over meeting arbitrary deadlines

## Key Quotes
- "It's sandboxy... it's like open like a Mario 64 world. It's a lot bigger and then instead of finding stars you find entrances to either like linear challenges or like puzzles or stuff like that. So there's a lot more meat to the stars."
- "Can this run on Nintendo 64? Of course. That's the whole point of this."
- "I don't think I want to reuse the fuzzy material from the other guy, because it's like too much to my body."

## Potential Interview Topics
- The evolution of Course 1 through multiple reworks and what drives the perfectionist approach to iterative design
- The creative decision to pivot away from the original "Bowser enslaves Yoshis" plot and how narrative considerations affect ROM hack development
- The technical challenges and creative opportunities of developing for original N64 hardware in 2023
- The balance between community input and maintaining creative vision during public development streams
- The paper craft aesthetic choice and how it influences both visual design and gameplay mechanics
