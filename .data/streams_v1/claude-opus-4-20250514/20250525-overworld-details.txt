## Game Development Process
- The game is "almost in a state where we would be able to just release the game" but Kaze wants to do more polishing with no set limit
- Overworld is approximately 30% complete, with 4 out of 14 parts finished
- Beta testing is being organized through a Google form, focusing on gameplay testing rather than bug testing
- Progress tracker shows: Overworld 28%, Course 6 10% (though Kaze notes this needs updating)
- Development appears to be in a late stage with focus shifting to polish and refinement

## Personal Insights
- "I need to make more videos recently. Because I need to feed my family. It sounds so depressing. But it is what it is."
- "I do not want to be known as a Nintendo person, please. Nintendo person is like a slur almost."
- "If you want it humble, then you are on the wrong channel. Over here we don't do humble, we do realistic."
- Expresses genuine frustration about forgetting a star idea: "I feel like we had a good idea too... I'm more interested in finding that area again than I am in coming up with something else"
- Shows dedication to making technical content more accessible: "I should make educational content that's digestible. I think that's the plan. I think that's how I get famous."

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Implementing a crystal-holding mechanic: "the idea was there would be a crystal here and while you hold the crystal a path around mario appears"
- Addressing player frustration with falling into water: "Falling in here is like the worst punishment the gods can bestow upon you" - solution involves adding "a bunch of tiny platforms that you can jump on to get back to the beginning"
- One-way mirror implementation connecting overworld to levels: "in Course 3, there is this mirror here that reflects the level back at you, and then in the overworld, there is this where you can look through the mirror"
- Struggling with texture selection, particularly dirt textures: "the texture I'm most worried about is the dirt texture here, because the dirt doesn't look good"
- Forgotten star mission causing development pause: "I forgot about the star. Wait, wasn't there an item you had to carry or something?"

## Business Aspects
- Squarespace sponsorship paying $2,500 flat rate per video
- Actively seeking new sponsors after Squarespace contract ends
- Rejected conversion-based sponsorship deals: "What kind of idiot would take on all the business risk?"
- Making YouTube videos primarily for financial reasons: "I would not have made a single one of those videos if Squarespace didn't pay me"
- Considering various sponsorship opportunities including gaming peripherals and financial services

## Key Quotes
- "Mario 64 is kind of a choose your own adventure type thing... if you're not having fun replaying it, then you're just playing the game wrong"
- "I think the main reason there are so many more Mario 64 hacks compared to Zelda hacks is because when you make a Mario 64 hack you don't have to really design the game... Nintendo already designed most of the game for you"
- "the beta testing here is literally just you casually playing the game. Be warned though that this is obviously an early version. And things will be rough"

## Potential Interview Topics
1. The balance between perfectionism and pragmatic release decisions - exploring why there's no set limit for polishing
2. The relationship between content creation/financial pressures and game development - how does managing multiple revenue streams affect development?
3. Collaboration challenges and successes - particularly the remote work with Biobak and communication issues
4. Design philosophy for ROM hacks - the "choose your own adventure" approach and building on Nintendo's foundation
5. The forgotten star mission incident - how documentation and project management evolved throughout development
