## Game Development Process
- Significant offline progress: "Dude, I made so much progress while I was offline. You guys have no idea. There's so many changes."
- Currently in late development/polishing phase, working on specific mechanics like ground pound cement footprints and enemy designs
- Beta testing completed: "I also was finally able to get the romhack properly beta tested, so from that I made a lot of adjustments to the game"
- Major technical hurdle identified: "I tested the game on N64 and while it runs super well when it runs, there's still a lot of crashes, like a lot of them. And I need to figure those out before we can release the game"
- Overworld remake in planning stages with team discussions about implementation

## Personal Insights
- Development philosophy: "My motto, my mantra is that if the compiler doesn't see a difference, I also don't see a difference. So code style is just not a thing for me."
- Work approach: "I'm not motivated at all, so there's no motivation involved. I just do it. It's really that easy."
- Focus on productivity: "I just want to not have to deal with all this being a human and asking questions and being social stuff. I just want to get stuff done."
- Self-taught programmer: "How long did it take to learn coding? I literally just looked at code and was able to program. I have never learned it. I was just born with it."
- Commitment to quality over speed: When asked about rushing, responds "Do you want me to rush the game? Do you want me to just settle for something that is worse than what I want on purpose?"

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Implementing ground pound mechanic that leaves marks in wet cement as part of construction site level
- N64 performance optimization concerns: "I'm kind of worried that this level is going to lag on N64 but I guess that happens with every level I make"
- Overworld shop system design: "Most likely what's going to happen is that there's going to be coins you collect and you store them globally, right? And then in the store, you'll be able to buy different stuff"
- Power star purchase option for struggling players: "You'll be able to buy, like, a power star. Not like a star star, like a power star power thing that will make it so that it's really easy to get a star. This will be, like, a thing for, like, bad players"
- Redesigning Toxbox enemy to fit oil rig theme using AI suggestions for industrial aesthetic
- Technical challenges with texture mapping and byte-level pixel manipulation for I4 textures

## Business Aspects
- Distribution plan: "Nintendo will let me distribute this and I will just upload a patch and then we can play that"
- Platform decision: Moved from Twitch to YouTube due to ads - "Twitch is just spamming so many ads that I just can't deal with it anymore"
- Channel growth: "It's actually crazy that this channel here already has like 11,000 subs"
- Content strategy consideration: "The thing is, the more clips I upload, the lower quality they have to be for me to actually have content to upload"
- Release date uncertainty: "When release date? I don't know."

## Key Quotes
- "I accidentally made a state-of-the-art programming code, I think. That's what people have told me... Someone sent- Like, I shared this on a Discord and they sent me a paper, like, oh have you looked at this? And then they looked at the paper and they were like, oh wait, you did the same thing."
- "I'm slowly approaching a point though where if I overdo it there isn't really much I can do anymore. I would have to cut back because there's no more things I can do in the engine really to save a lot of stuff."
- "You can see the overworld change while you play, which I think would be really cool."
