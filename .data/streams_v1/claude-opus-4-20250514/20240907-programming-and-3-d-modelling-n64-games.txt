## Game Development Process
- Currently working on Course 14 which is "already like half way done"
- After completing current work, has "two more stages" remaining
- Working on implementing a Mario Land-inspired shooting minigame with 3D models
- Level currently has "19,000 triangles and it's like barely finished" indicating ongoing optimization concerns
- Plans to release a new demo "at some point in the near future" featuring "just the first course"
- Converting 2D Mario Land enemies (birds/chickens) into 3D models while maintaining retro aesthetic

## Personal Insights
- "I feel so exhausted today... Because my parents are here right now, I can't be around people for too long, no matter who it is" - reveals introversion and need for solitude during development
- On potential Nintendo intervention: "there is a worry that nintendo is just going to say now fuck you your game is over but you just have to live with that it's all you can do"
- Strong focus on accessibility: "every step along the way like opening project 64 setting to 8 megabytes clicking the rom patching the rom you lose some percentage of your player base"
- Philosophical view on pixel art: "pixel art is not real... it's voxel art"
- On Portal 64 shutdown: Believes the creator used Nintendo/Valve as an excuse to stop working on tedious parts of development

  - Wiseguy: Developer of RT64 graphics plugin and recomp, described as "actually a really good programmer"
  - Leela/Lila: Active chat participant providing feedback and suggestions

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Converting 2D Mario Land elements to 3D: "Would you want to just play a copy of Mario Land on Mario 64? What's the point in that? Right, it has to be different and I chose to make it different by having it be 3D"
- Camera angle debates: When community suggests rotating camera, Kaze responds "How are you going to aim if I rotate the camera view?"
- Graphics plugin limitations: "There is a problem in the graphic plugin where the texture is not going to look right because it's a point filter texture"
- Enemy design: Making birds face "the same way that we do in mario land one" for authenticity
- Performance vs visual fidelity: Choosing simpler animation methods due to memory constraints
- Creating shootable enemies with appropriate collision detection and death animations

## Business Aspects
- Demo release strategy: Planning to release first course as a demo to gauge interest
- Asset distribution: "I'll definitely publish everything including assets... I would release the blend files as well"
- Accessibility concerns: Strongly focused on reducing barriers to entry for players
- Graphics plugin dependency: Hoping "Gliden either gets updated or RT64 comes out before my hack releases"
- No monetization mentioned - appears to be a free fan project

## Key Quotes

- "every step along the way like opening project 64 setting to 8 megabytes clicking the rom patching the rom you lose some percentage of your player base and the more unusual your setup is the higher the percentage will be"
- "there is a worry that nintendo is just going to say now fuck you your game is over but you just have to live with that it's all you can do"
