## Game Development Process
- Currently working on course 14, with only "the last two courses" remaining in development
- Main content expected to be finished in 2025, followed by beta testing and bug fixing: "2025, we're probably going to finish all the main content in 2025, but there's still beta left. Testing and bug fixing to be done"
- Individual levels have been tested, but official playtesting hasn't started yet: "I mean I do have had people test individual levels but the official playlist has not started yet"
- Using custom engine called "Kanki" for development
- Using Blender as level editor with Fast 64 script for N64 format exports
- Currently in texturing phase after completing layout for pyramid level

## Personal Insights
- Uncertain about initial design choices: "I'm not sure if I like it or hate it. It's kind of interesting. It does feel maze like"
- Acknowledges risk of Nintendo takedown but accepts it: "it was a calculated risk I still wanted to do it"
- Philosophy on first impressions: "this we have to think about it is the first level this is going to be your first impression of the game it has to be absolute peak"
- Self-aware about perfectionism: "people are making fun of how I pronounce texture all the time"
- Comparison to previous work: "the first time was not peak and you got the game for free"

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: No relevant information found in this transcript
- Biobak: Mentioned as graphics artist who will handle visual improvements: "I know it looks poofy right now but Biobak said it's gonna move it so I'm not worrying about it for now"
- Zeina: Mentioned only in personal context as Kaze's partner/wife, not in professional capacity as animator
- Other Contributors: No additional contributors mentioned in professional capacity

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Major redesign of pyramid level from maze-like structure to central room with exits based on feedback: "One central room with two stories and for four exits"
- Camera issues in tight spaces identified as primary concern: "The one thing I'm actually most worried about in this area is the camera"
- Red coin collection design challenge: "we do have the problem right now that you might go through the entire maze without collecting all eight coins"
- Implementation of instant warps to improve navigation: "We could just have an instant warp at the bottom that goes back to the top"
- First level must make strong impression since game is free: "the fact that this game doesn't cost money in a way that's really bad news for us if you have a paid video game you have an investment"

## Business Aspects
- Anticipating potential Nintendo takedown: "how long do you think this game will be up before nintendo takes it down... I think like a week is realistic"
- Planning copyright-free trailer strategy: "I uploaded it with a copyright free trailer as well like right next to it"
- Acknowledging impact on visibility: "it would kill my views and stuff and it would stop the game from like becoming more famous"
- Game will be free, which affects player investment: "the fact that this game doesn't cost money in a way that's really bad news for us"
- Calculated acceptance of legal risks: "yes I knew this was going to happen but I didn't know it was going to happen... it was a calculated risk"

## Key Quotes
- "This is the first level, this is going to be your first impression of the game, it has to be absolute peak."
- "I think there's a chance they might just leave me alone. I mean when you consider how old Mario 64 is at this point, come on."
- "This is a really dangerous design... I think maybe maybe we need something else."

## Potential Interview Topics
- The decision to release for free despite investment concerns - exploring the philosophy behind this choice
- The iterative design process and how community feedback shapes level design decisions
- Technical innovations using the custom Kanki engine and Mario 64 decompilation
- Risk assessment and acceptance regarding potential Nintendo legal action
- The pressure of creating a strong first impression with the opening level given the free distribution model
