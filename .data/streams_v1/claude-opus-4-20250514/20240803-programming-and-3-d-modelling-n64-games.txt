## Game Development Process
- Currently working on Course 13 (boss fight with Raphael the Raven)
- Game has 98 custom songs integrated, with comparison to Mario Odyssey's 82 songs
- "We are currently like 120 stars done and we're working on the overworld and the enemies. So it's getting pretty close. We have probably around 30% of the enemies in now."
- Using M64 format (MIDI-like) for 80-90% of the OST via Sac64, with 20% being streamed music
- Development approach involves iterative improvement: "Surely you know that the levels always look like shit at the beginning and then look better at the end"

## Personal Insights
- "I am convinced people that need more 64 hex or more 64 to be difficult. Just do not understand the point of our 64. The point is that you're free. It's it's all freedom. Like if you want the game to be more difficult and do more risky jumps. Just go for it."
- "A lot of people seem surprised that the level actually looks good now. Apparently, everyone thought that level is going to be complete ass. And I don't know. I don't know why you don't have confidence in me by now."
- Views on game design philosophy: "Mario 64 is about freedom and exploration. Being directed to that heavily would, I think, ruin a lot of it."
- Commitment to quality: "I can't release it before it's finished, unfortunately. Because then I would release an unfinished product. The thing that everybody hates EA for."

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: Primary composer, described as bringing great creativity - "Badubb's music is great. The creativity he brings to the table is very, very sick."
- Biobak: Graphics artist who sent design reference videos for the Raphael boss fight
- Zeina: Animator, mentioned as having "a lot more work with it than I do" regarding the project
- Other Contributors:
  - Dot Star Money: Composer who created music for previous Kaze mods, including "Colossal Circuits" from 2016
  - Yellow/Jesse: Created a beach demo
  - Arthur: Will be consulted for planetary gravity code implementation

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Extensive brainstorming for Raphael the Raven boss fight mechanics, including moon-based combat with gravity effects
- Decision between ice version vs regular version of Raphael: "I kind of like using the ice variant of him. It looks a little more cursed and fitting here"
- Boss fight design priorities: "it being a cool set-piece is my number one priority for bosses, always"
- Technical challenges with implementing hollow moon mechanics: "to do the hollow moon properly, we would need to make a change to how gravity works like universally, which I don't want"
- Final boss concept: Player gets launched to moon, dodges falling stars, fights Raphael who shoots frozen cheese ninja stars that collide and can be thrown back at him

## Business Aspects
- No set release date: "When is it done? I'm on course 13 right now. You're just going to have to wait until it's done"
- No mention of pricing or distribution plans
- Focus on quality over speed: "I can't release it before it's finished, unfortunately"

## Key Quotes
- "Mario 64 is about freedom and exploration. Being directed to that heavily would, I think, ruin a lot of it."
- "Surely you know that the levels always look like shit at the beginning and then look better at the end. And I'm not playing for me enough. This is so platforming."
- "programming the moon is going to be awful. I'm going to ask Arthur for his planetary gravity code because he already knows what to do, I think."
