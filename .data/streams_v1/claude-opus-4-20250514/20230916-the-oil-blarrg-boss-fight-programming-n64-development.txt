## Game Development Process
- Currently implementing a cutscene sequence where "the boss eats mario and spits you out at the scene where you fight them"
- Working on atmospheric transitions and environmental storytelling: "when you're in here you still hear the music right but then when you go out... when you come out everyone's gone it's quiet you don't know what's happening and then this guy appears"
- Implementing dialogue sequences with Bowser: "you're gonna talk to bowser and bowser's gonna be like man my minions are so lazy they won't work i have to send them the big guns"
- Technical issues with visibility of game elements noted ("you can't even see him... it's a work in progress")
