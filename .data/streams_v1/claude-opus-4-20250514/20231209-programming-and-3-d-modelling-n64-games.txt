## Game Development Process
- The game has at least 11 courses completed ("You guys miss like all of course 10, course 9, course 11")
- Currently working on "Oily Boily Bay" which is described as "a pretty early area still"
- Implemented 16 different floor types with unique properties and sound effects (grass, water, stone, creaky woods, snow, sand, ice, mud, wood, steel, glass, leaves, squishy, and grates)
- Target release date is 2024, though Kaze expresses uncertainty: "Game of the year 2024, I hope I can release it 2024, I don't actually know"
- Running low on retro games to reference: "We're almost out of retro games. So we're getting kinda desperate here. We're pulling from games that are barely even retro games"
- Each main course includes a retro game-inspired section

## Personal Insights
- Takes pride in personally implementing features: "I'm making it myself, so I thought I could explain this"
- Has signature design elements he includes across games: "I love my thwomp domino, I do that in like every game ever"
- Values precision and conciseness in communication: "I think that when you speak you should be precise and you should be concise those are the two qualities i value the most in speech"
- Approaches challenges with determination: "For me honestly it's not as much about building big muscles it's just about building strength at this point I just like the challenge of like increasing the weight"
- Recently moved to a new house with a home gym setup

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: Composer who has created music for all areas. Kaze states: "We already have songs for all these areas from Badub. And the songs are a banger"
- Biobak: No information found in this transcript
- Zeina: Appears to be Kaze's partner who participates in streams and watches movies with him. Referenced multiple times in personal contexts
- Other Contributors: No additional contributors mentioned in this transcript

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Implementing complex surface system: "Every surface has a type that is a bunch of different flags on what should be active on"
- Creating 3D adaptations of 2D concepts: "Board the Platforms! It'll be like Mario State from Board the Platforms in Smash 64, but in 3D"
- Planned retro levels include: Board the Platforms (Smash 64), Mario Paint, Dr. Mario, and Mario Land 1
- Future level themes planned: Wild West Valley (with boss enemies to catch), a music-themed level, an oversized casino level, and a comic superhero world
- Struggling with design decisions for certain elements: "I have like no ideas for this" (regarding music and casino levels)
- Real-time problem-solving for visual effects and platform placement during the stream

## Business Aspects
- Kaze works at Gears for Breakfast (A Hat in Time developer) while developing this project
- Utilizes multistreaming strategy: "I think the multi stream is definitely the way to go We reach so many more people I become a bigger cultural event"
- Project appears to be funded through streaming donations and Patreon support
- Conscious of building audience and engagement through content strategy
- No mention of publisher or external funding
