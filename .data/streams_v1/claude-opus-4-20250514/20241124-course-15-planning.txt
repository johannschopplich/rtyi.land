## Game Development Process
- The demo for Return to Yoshi's Island is "basically done" and will be released after Christmas, likely in February 2025
- Currently working on Course 15, described as "the last main course" - a space-themed arcade level called "Space Arcade" or "Asteroid Arcade"
- The level already runs at a stable 60 FPS on N64 hardware with all enhancements enabled
- Plans to release the demo on the "Case Clips channel, not on the main channel"
- The entire game is based on the Mario 64 decompilation and will eventually be open-sourced

## Personal Insights
- "I'm planning to open source it. The problem is if I open source it right now I'm going to open source it with my entire game. And I don't want to leak my entire game early before it's done."
- On game design philosophy: "Certainty of goals, freedom in how to achieve those goals movement wise"
- Critical of linear design: "I'm saying we need the certainty of goals. We need the player to know exactly where to go. No question about it. Then I'm thinking. We don't want the level to feel linear. So how do we do that? Well, it's difficult. Maybe it's impossible."
- On Dark Souls: "The way I perceive it is you just learn the boss patterns. Which takes like maybe two or three tries. And then you just execute on your pre-made decisions. It's like learning how to work a factory job."
- Mentions being German when another German viewer identifies themselves

  - DanGPTV: Referenced as potentially having done similar space-themed enemy designs that Kaze wanted to avoid copying
  - Discord community: Actively participates in design discussions during streams
  - Previous mention of paid Roblox stream collaboration

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Central design challenge: "How do we make sure the player is certain of their goals? How do we get to the level? Get the pure Bing Bing Wahoo fun."
- Decided on incorporating various arcade games controlled by Mario's movement: Pac-Man adaptation with chain chomps, Tetris survival challenge, coin concentration/shell game
- Implementation of space-themed enemies: "space shy guys" and "space skeeters" that can jump between planets
- Use of multiple movement options: wing cap, cloud cap, teleporters, and "flipper pieces" that shoot Mario upward
- Design philosophy of "edging the player" - building anticipation by showing distant objectives
- Decision to have the flipper star area below the main course that shoots players back up

## Business Aspects
- Strategic release timing: "I will release it shortly after Christmas, because if you release stuff around Christmas, Nintendo gets very angry"
- Previous paid collaboration: "I'm not playing Roblox again unless they pay me again"
- Open source plans: "But it will be open source once it's finished. So don't worry about that."
- Content creation: "I have a banger video planned for like two weeks or so"

## Key Quotes
- "Certainty of goals, freedom in how to achieve those goals movement wise. Select multiple minor paths that can see each other and the full path so you never question what to do beyond picking freedom."
- "Edging the player is like important. Which we could do better with an act system."
- "I am having fun making my game. I'm just thinking about how to [design] this."
