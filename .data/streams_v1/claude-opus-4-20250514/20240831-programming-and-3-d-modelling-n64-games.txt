## Game Development Process
- Significant progress made on ice castle level - "I made a lot of progress since I skipped one week of streams"
- Completed all platforming sections inside the castle - "I finished all the platforming inside the castle. Right now we just have to make the castle look good"
- Planning for 7 stars across 12 levels (approximately 84 stars total, potentially 90-100)
- Outside area planned to be "a little village with penguin huts"
- Room-by-room iterative improvement approach - "This room now looks decent. It's still not good, but it no longer looks like complete ass"

## Personal Insights
- On game design philosophy: "I think the difficulty here is appropriate for CoS 13" (regarding platforming challenges)
- Critical view of other developers: Regarding Rare - "I would talk very poorly about it and people think Rare is like the goat of the N64"
- On Final Fantasy VII: "The game has a really cool vibe. It's really fun to just exist in the world. But goddamn, I hate JRPGs"
- Pride in visual progress: "Look at this shit, it's so beautiful" (referring to level visuals)
- Work-life balance: Recently became a parent - "Sorry for being late, but congrats on becoming parents"

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: No relevant information found
- Biobak: No relevant information found  
- Zeina: Working on penguin village assets - "Zeina is actually working on some assets for it right now"; Recently had a baby - "Zeina is having a lot of fun with the baby"
- Other Contributors:
  - Saren: F3DX3 microcode developer, working on performance optimizations - "He's working on a new microcode for the N64 called X3. F3DX3"
  - Lila: Fast64 developer, active in chat providing technical feedback
  - Editor: Working on upcoming video - "My editor has been on it for a week"

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Ice castle visual design evolution - transformed from looking like "complete ass" to "decent"
- Implementation of special effects: "threshold alpha with combiner clamping" for objects fading into view
- Planned mirror wallkick section - "there will be a wallkick section. On the mirror. So it will look like you're punching wallkick mirror Mario"
- Performance optimization challenges - dealing with RSP bottlenecks: "the reason the n64 is slow is because of fill rate and memory throughput and now we're at this point and actually it's the rsp"
- Texture batching issues with character models requiring consolidation - "I'm gonna reduce the materials on the bunny so that the batching works better"

## Business Aspects
- Release timeline mentioned: "after that, it's going to be the demo. So we have a few more weeks"
- No other business aspects mentioned

## Key Quotes
- "This room now looks decent. It's still not good, but it no longer looks like complete ass. I kind of like this ice carpet here. I think it's a nice touch."
- "Every time I upload a video that I show my face and everyone's always like, Kaze, you're so much muscle. How is this possible?"
- "I'm about to fail a fucking QuickTime event and go on a full rant about how terrible Banjo-Kazooie optimizes"

## Potential Interview Topics
- The evolution of level design from initial concepts to polished areas
- Balancing new parenthood with intensive game development
- The importance of technical collaborations (like with Saren) in pushing N64 capabilities
- The iterative process of visual improvement and when to consider something "good enough"
- Community engagement through streaming and how it influences development decisions
