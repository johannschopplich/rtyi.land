## Game Development Process
- Currently working on Course 12 (cowboy/western-themed level)
- Development has slowed since Course 9 due to Kaze taking a full-time job: "development has slowed down ever since the end of course 9, because I have a full-time job now"
- Level development process follows four steps: "1) Settle on art style, 2) Draw overhead map, 3) Make block out, 4) Make level look decent"
- Multi-streaming to both Twitch and YouTube simultaneously
- Using Fast64 plugin in Blender to export levels into decomp

## Personal Insights
- Embraces method acting for development: "I'm gonna be wearing the hat all day today, because I am a cowboy today, I gotta get in the mood"
- Wants to create an over-the-top western aesthetic: "You know how people that pretend to be Japanese, like weeaboos, how they completely overdo Japanese culture or what they perceive to be Japanese culture? I want it to be that, but for cowboys"
- Shows perfectionism about visual cohesion: "I care. I'm just trying to get a vibe check for this in-game"
- Expresses frustration but acceptance of the process: "Don't worry about it, guys. Finding the art style always takes a while"

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: Sent new music for the level during the stream. Kaze's enthusiastic reaction: "Oh shit, Badoop just wrote me. Oh, he got a song. Oh, this is so good. Yo. Oh, that's so perfect. I love this." The music influenced design decisions about adding fog to the level
- Biobak: Mentioned in passing when discussing the visual similarity to Mario Odyssey's Sand Kingdom
- Zeina: Briefly mentioned coming home during the stream, but no work contributions discussed
- Beta: Active in chat, made song donations/requests during the stream
- Other Contributors: No additional contributors mentioned for this specific level

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Three boss missions planned: "First star in the saloon, there will be a secret room... shootout with the Snuffit" / "Monty Mole that has robbed the bank" / "train robbery... carried out by five Goombas"
- Unique enemy concept: "there is a really tall Goomba in a trench coat with five cowboy hats on... you have to topple him over"
- NPCs will serve milk in the saloon with humorous dialogue: "I'm lactose intolerant, but I still drink milk. Cowboys aren't exactly known for following the law"
- Struggling to find the right visual style: spent most of the stream testing different color palettes, fog effects, and building styles
- Train system for fast travel: "you can go on the train to instantly go from area 1 to area 3"
- All NPCs will greet with "Howdy, partner. That's how every textbook starts in this"

## Business Aspects
- Has donation system set up: "We got donations set up again, we got rewards set up"
- Development impacted by employment: full-time job has slowed progress since Course 9
- No specific marketing, funding, or release plans mentioned

## Key Quotes
- "I want people to look at this and be like, wow, okay, chill out. You know how people that pretend to be Japanese, like weeaboos, how they completely overdo Japanese culture? I want it to be that, but for cowboys."
- "development has slowed down ever since the end of course 9, because I have a full-time job now"
- "This song definitely makes me think we need to add fog to this level... Bluefog is good to go. I think we're ready to move on to the next step"

## Potential Interview Topics
- How has balancing full-time employment with passion project development affected the creative process and timeline?
- The collaborative relationship with Badub - how does receiving music during development influence level design decisions?
- The philosophy behind the "cowboyaboo" aesthetic - using parody and exaggeration as a design principle
- The role of live streaming and real-time community feedback in shaping design decisions
- Technical challenges of achieving desired visual effects within N64 hardware limitations
