## Game Development Process
- Achieved significant 5% render speed improvement, increasing performance from 44 FPS to 46 FPS through culling optimizations
- Project is "over 70% done at this point" with "four and a half courses" remaining to complete
- Made engine improvements to make adding shadows and culling radiuses easier for all objects
- Current ROM size is approximately 46 megabytes
- Implementing new star select screens and oil/hazard mechanics during this stream

## Personal Insights
- "I reduced render time by like 5% almost... 5% is so much" - shows pride in optimization achievements
- On accidentally scheduling multiple videos: "I'm really sad that I fucked up today... that's why it's getting less views than it should but yeah devastating"
- Strong opinions on proper programming practices: "blueprints are not for programming... imagine you go to a restaurant and you ask the chef if he like prefers to eat soup with a spoon or like a shovel"
- Philosophy on respect: "They don't need to respect their opinions or their views or anything. They're all stupid, but they can murder you. That's the only reason."
- On accessibility in programming: "if you have like a learning disability you can still just memorize everything i don't recommend learning programming that way but it's theoretically possible"

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: No specific mentions in this transcript
- Biobak (also referred to as Biobak/Biomech): Created new star select screen designs and animations that Kaze is implementing. Kaze asks for feedback: "what do you think biomech" and references "Biobak's vision" for UI layout
- Zeina: Mentioned only in passing - Kaze took her to see seals when she visited
- Other Contributors: 
  - Robot: Mentioned as someone who "thinks cum is so funny" during a Discord conversation
  - Arthur: Mentioned as being on Discord with Kaze and Robot
  - Atlas: Briefly mentioned in relation to using array modifiers

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Implemented new star select screen with scrolling rainbow backgrounds and flying-in animation effects
- Struggled with precise text centering: "that is close enough. Let's be real. It's within measuring error"
- Developed oil hazard mechanics with custom respawn system that saves player's last safe position
- Fixed Mario 64's original culling code: "Mario 64's culling code was like they culled as if the field of view was 45 degrees when an edge currently was 60 degrees"
- Decided against using checkpoint flags: "i hate the idea of flags" - instead implementing smart position tracking
- Added death animation and camera behavior for falling into oil: "I want the camera to just kind of point down at the oil and have it be like, look, there goes Mario"

## Business Aspects
- Concerns about video scheduling affecting viewership: "that's why it's getting less views than it should"
- Discussion about programmer salaries ranging from 57k to 400k in big companies
- Mentioned game developers making "only 60k on average"
- No specific mentions of funding or release plans for the ROM hack

## Key Quotes
- "imagine you come from Mario 64 and then you haven't you all whatever that's gonna be in this is not the overworld and you're like all you're all innocent you think I was just gonna be a normal game and then you see this and then you enter the level and the cuts in place oh that's gonna be so impressive"
- "I invented better kerning, and this is not used here... I invented kerning, yes. I'm sorry, guys, but I did. I invented kerning."
- "We live in a time where everyone can just fucking murder anyone if they really wanted to. And that's why you need to put some respect on other humans, because they can murder you."

## Potential Interview Topics
1. The collaborative process with artists like Biobak - how does implementing others' visions challenge or enhance the development process?
2. The importance of optimization in ROM hacking - what drives the pursuit of performance improvements like the 5% render speed gain?
3. Design philosophy around player experience - why avoid checkpoint flags in favor of smart position tracking?
4. The balance between technical excellence and meeting deadlines - how do you decide when something is "close enough"?
5. The future of Mario 64 modding and what makes "Return to Yoshi's Island" stand out in the ROM hacking community
