As the project grows, their creative loop (animations, signs, difficulty tuning) collides with a life milestone that rewires everything: becoming parents, and the meaning behind their daughter’s name, Reyna.",
      "narrative_value": "This is the film’s emotional anchor: the project is made inside a real partnership, under real pressure. It translates ROM hacking into something universally relatable—honest feedback, shared deadlines, and building a dream while life keeps happening.",
      "challenge": "Finish ambitious set pieces that depend on Zeina’s animation/art pipeline, while tuning difficulty based on a real human player—not the developer’s expert hands—and doing it all as the couple’s time and energy compress around parenthood.",
      "process": "Kaze uses Zeina’s play sessions as evidence for design changes (reducing harsh punishment when it’s painful to watch). They iterate on art/animation readability, and they negotiate production dependencies where Kaze’s code polish waits for her deliverables. As the due date approaches, streaming cadence and planning shift, and the game’s timeline is forced to coexist with family reality.",
      "outcome": "RTYI’s difficulty curve and personality are directly shaped by this private feedback loop. The relationship becomes part of the production system—both a strength (fast, honest iteration) and a constraint (time, energy, and emotional load).",
