He positions the “hard way” as a deliberate choice—because he wants the result to stand on its own for normal players, not just ROM-hack veterans. This becomes the lens through which most later tradeoffs (performance, onboarding, overworld structure, legal posture) are justified.",

      "summary": "Kaze designs a volcano setpiece where a Bone Dragon head emerges from lava, presenting like a boss—but it’s actually an ally in pain due to a rotten tooth. The mission becomes a two-act quest: break the bad tooth (with improved readability), then later pay coins into a “money hole” to buy a gold tooth and permanently befriend the dragon, unlocking traversal into side content. It’s kindness, comedy, and economy in one arc.",

      "challenge": "Create an iconic overworld setpiece with clear player read and meaningful payoff without building a full boss fight.",
      "process": "Iterate tooth mechanic for clarity; design phase-two as a coin sink with permanent resolution; tie payoff to traversal/side-level access.",

      "summary": "Kaze evolves an overworld combat idea into a defend-the-object mission: talk to a gardener Yoshi, a cutscene frames the threat, Shy Guys invade, and Mario must protect a single melon. Implementation reveals difficult details—pathing to the objective, clean win/lose resets, and hitbox fairness—prompting multiple tuning passes (including removing unfair lingering hitboxes). The mission becomes a live demonstration of “excitement without cruelty.”",
      "narrative_value": "A compact, end-to-end design arc that shows how RTYI turns ideas into readable scenarios and then sands off unfairness.",
      "challenge": "Make a defend-the-object mission fun and fair within SM64 engine constraints and camera limitations.",
      "process": "Simplify objective to one melon; script waves; instrument feedback; fix hitbox/pacing issues; rebuild intro with cutscene control over camera/spawns.",
      "outcome": "A largely working scenario loop with remaining polish focused on presentation and reward flow.",
      "key_quote": "Let's make this mission through melon defense. I like melon defense.",
