      "title": "Making a ‘new N64 game’: hardware-first optimization, profiling, and the F3DEX3 bet",
      "summary": "As RTYI grows beyond vanilla SM64 scale, Kaze repeatedly hits failures that only appear on real N64 hardware: obscure MIPS/ABI pitfalls, alignment/DMA issues, register clobbers, and sudden FPS collapses from specific camera angles. Over time he moves from one-off fixes (culling, sprite coins, math tweaks) to instrumentation—using Sauraen’s trace/profiler to learn the game is often “slow” because it’s idling/waiting. The long-running mystery of why F3DEX3 seemed slower in RTYI becomes a months-long investigation that ends with microcode counter work and renewed confidence that F3DEX3 is the ceiling-raiser for the whole project.",
      "narrative_value": "This is the documentary’s central engine: ambition colliding with physical limits, then a mindset shift from guesswork to measurement. It’s also where the project becomes bigger than “a ROM hack”—they’re effectively doing platform engineering—while naturally bringing in collaborators and downstream consequences for art, animation, and music budgets.",
      "challenge": "RTYI must look and feel dramatically more modern than SM64 while still running correctly on real N64; emulator success can hide hardware-only crashes and misleading performance bottlenecks.",
      "process": "Relentless console validation; targeted render optimizations; deep crash debugging (delay slots/register preservation); adopting a timeline profiler; and collaborative benchmarking/instrumentation to explain RTYI-specific F3DEX3 behavior.",
      "outcome": "Kaze commits to F3DEX3 as the forward path with a concrete compatibility/TODO list; the team gains a profiler-driven optimization loop and a clearer mental model of what actually costs frame time.",
      "key_quote": "It’s around 76% of the entire game—it’s just the game doing nothing at all.",

      "summary": "Kaze treats RTYI’s overworld as the entire Yoshi’s Island—something explorable, coherent, and reactive—so he intentionally delays it until enough courses exist to anchor pacing and geography. When the overworld push begins, the island quickly becomes a system: landmark foreshadowing (like the lighthouse), loopbacks, overworld-only quests/stars, and permanent world-state changes (fog lifting, reveals, rebuilds) triggered by player progress. A major milestone lands when you can run a full 360° around the island, shifting the remaining work to density, readability, and persistence under N64 constraints.",
      "narrative_value": "This is the clearest articulation of RTYI’s ‘why’: not just more levels, but a unified world with cause-and-effect progression—something most ROM hacks don’t attempt. It also gives the film an inherently visual spine (before/after world changes, landmark payoffs) that can structure the entire feature.",
      "challenge": "Make a massive, readable overworld on N64 that feels like a real island—without empty travel, arbitrary gating, or a portal-room vibe—and with robust save-flag/persistence logic.",
      "process": "Geography-first planning; visible-but-reachable points of interest; progression gates as physical world events (not menus); auditing star counts so the hub has bespoke content; and pacing fixes (corridor shortening, warps/world map planning) while insisting on permanent change when events happen.",
      "outcome": "A multi-biome island blueprint is proven and partially implemented; the core concept works, but it still needs content density, art consistency, and hardened persistence architecture to support all planned events.",
      "key_quote": "The reason I leave the hub world for last is that I think the hub world is by far the most important part of the game.",

      "summary": "Kaze develops RTYI while treating Nintendo enforcement as a recurring, personal risk: past takedowns shape what he’s willing to publish, how he markets, and how he plans release timing. He rejects paid access models for the hack, explores safer “souvenir” options (like non-ROM physical merch), and commits to a free release with post-release open-sourcing—delaying anything that might leak unfinished content. In parallel, he outlines a contingency plan: if forced, strip Nintendo IP (Mario/Yoshis/enemies/assets) and convert the project into an original game that could survive outside Nintendo’s shadow.",
      "narrative_value": "This adds external stakes and explains many otherwise-mysterious decisions (documentation avoidance, release pacing, monetization boundaries). It also reframes RTYI as both passion project and potential launchpad—engineering/design work robust enough to survive a forced identity change.",
      "challenge": "Share and sustain a high-profile Mario-derived project without triggering immediate enforcement—while still paying collaborators and keeping the community engaged.",
      "process": "Design onboarding into the game (less external tutorial content); avoid paywalled builds; separate merch from ROM distribution; plan release windows strategically; make copyright-resilient promotional materials; and maintain an explicit “original-IP conversion” roadmap if enforcement arrives.",

As Kaze expands technical capability (notably longer animations via streaming frames), Zeina’s animation/character work becomes a recurring dependency for NPCs, bosses, and comedic beats. Late in the timeline, they share a major personal milestone—a baby girl (Reyna)—turning the project’s schedule into something explicitly intertwined with their family life.",
      "narrative_value": "This is the human spine of the film: the project isn’t just engineering bravado, it’s a marriage and a shared creative language under real-life constraints. It also gives a natural structure for a joint interview: how they calibrate tone, disagree, test ideas, and protect the ‘Yoshi’s Island spirit.’",

The result improves stability but reshapes iconic behaviors (like BLJ) and creates new emergent tech, forcing Kaze to decide what ‘counts’ as Mario 64 identity versus what must be curtailed to protect level design. In parallel, player feedback repeatedly forces compromises—restoring or reworking control changes when they violate trust, and shifting mandatory tutorials into optional mastery content.",
      "narrative_value": "This is Kaze’s design ethos under pressure: modernize without turning the game into a different genre, and respect the player’s expectations even when it contradicts the developer’s ‘perfect’ vision. It’s also a rare ROM-hack story where speedrun culture, accessibility, and level-design integrity all collide in one system.",

      "summary": "Course 11 starts as a volcano/construction idea, but Kaze realizes it reads visually monotone and lacks a distinctive identity. With Biobak’s input, he pivots hard to an offshore oil rig that manufactures Bowser’s airships, triggering a cascading redesign: traversal scale, visual readability (oil vs lava), and mission structure that still feels like Mario 64. Over many iterations it becomes a chain of sabotage setpieces and comedy polish (like wet-cement footprints that ‘remember’ Mario) under strict N64 performance constraints.",
      "narrative_value": "A full creative arc with a clean turning point and lots of filmable ‘before/after.’ It’s also one of the strongest windows into Kaze/Biobak collaboration and Kaze’s core philosophy: clarity without hand-holding, and big setpieces that must still play like Mario 64 (not a scripted spectacle).",

That forces constant tradeoffs: streamed vs sequenced tracks, mono vs stereo, and even the possibility of dropping streamed songs for later courses. New trimming tooling (like STRM64) buys space back but creates new QA risk (loop points breaking), turning music into a persistent production budget rather than a solved creative layer.",

The refactor targets performance, code size, polyphony, and debuggability—accepting temporary instability as systems are replaced. A major payoff lands when a long-running crackle/buzz artifact that hurt perceived polish is finally eliminated (with only rare residual noise).",
      "narrative_value": "A strong ‘under the hood’ arc with an audible before/after payoff, and a natural bridge to Badub’s perspective on what the composer needs versus what the engine can deliver. It reinforces the film’s central theme: they’re not just making content, they’re rebuilding a console game’s foundation to make a new one possible.",

He pivots the fight into curing a corrupted Yoshi by destroying growths/weak points to restore it, then iterates on readability and N64-feasible tentacle collision to prevent jank and softlocks. When early visuals read as too disgusting, the corruption motif shifts from tumor-like growths to mushrooms to keep the tone shippable while preserving the premise.",
