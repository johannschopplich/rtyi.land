## Game Development Process
- The game will have 15 main courses total: "We are getting 15 courses"
- Currently working on Course 15, which is described as a "space arcade"
- Major remaining work includes: "after this, we still need to do the Overworld and the Bowser level and some side level... there's three side levels missing if you include the Bowser one"
- Recent technical improvements: "I overhauled Mario's animation system. Mario's animations are now much more consistent"
- Physics enhancements noted: "the physics do feel infinitely better. Everything you do just works"
- Each main level will have "three Yoshi stars per main level, which are like green stars in our galaxy"

## Personal Insights
- On development freedom: "What I do here is basically I call all the shots. I can develop my game like as fast as I want. I don't need like approval from 15 people to do anything"
- On RTYI's potential impact: "RTYI is definitely going to be the romhack where people are like, this is the reason I even get into romhacks"
- On working in large companies vs indie: "When you work in a corporation, everything is much slower. Everything goes for like five departments"
- On game design philosophy: "I don't want to have to play in a stupid way just so I can enjoy it"
- Making the project open source: "I think people will romhack off of this because I'm going to make the board public"

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: No relevant information found in this transcript
- Biobak/Biomech: Graphics artist responsible for level design reworks and 3D modeling. Kaze works directly with Biobak's files and implements his design changes. Specific contribution mentioned: level rework with improved lighting, textures, and geometric details
- Zeina: No relevant information found in this transcript
- Other Contributors:
  - Spiralback: Contributed the "giant rocket that's the casino/arcade" concept for Course 15
  - Arthur Tilley: Suggested the idea for the warp pipe in Course 15 to take players to Mario 64 level fragments
  - Holly: Mentioned in passing
  - Lila/Leela: Appears to be providing technical support during the stream

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Course 15 structure includes six stars with various arcade-themed challenges:
  - Star 1: On top of the arcade building
  - Star 2: Whack-a-mole arcade game
  - Star 3: Rhythm game
  - Star 4: Skee-ball game with cannon mechanics
  - Star 5: "Pinball in space" with platforming on pinball machine parts
  - Star 6: Warp pipe leading to Mario 64 level fragments
- Design philosophy for Mario 64 references: "not remade SM64 levels, but chunks referencing parts of Mario 64 levels... Like fragments of SM64 levels floating around"
- Technical challenges with collision maps causing crashes, requiring optimization from ~8,000 to ~3,900 triangles
- Extensive list of arcade minigame concepts including pixel art activation, memory path games, and simplified Star Fox-style gameplay

## Business Aspects
- Community impact consideration: "Do you think RTYI will become the default romhack as in if someone gets into romhacking and asks for a good one to play, people recommend RTYI?"
- Open source plans: "I'm going to make the board public" to enable others to create romhacks based on RTYI
- Emulator compatibility concerns discussed regarding various platforms (Project64, ParaLLEl, Rosalie's Mupen64Plus)

## Key Quotes
- "RTYI is definitely going to be the romhack where people are like, this is the reason I even get into romhacks. So it's going to have that going for it."
- "I think the contrast between Mario 64 levels and RTYI levels is going to be beautiful at display here."
- "Everything you do just works. Yeah, that too. You can have crazy geometry in this engine and it's going to perform better than the vanilla engine"

## Potential Interview Topics
- The decision-making process behind including Mario 64 level fragments in the final course and how it serves as both nostalgia and contrast
- The collaborative workflow with artists like Biobak and how their contributions are integrated into the game
- Technical innovations in physics and collision handling that set RTYI apart from other ROM hacks
- The vision for RTYI's role in the ROM hacking community and plans for making it a platform for future creators
- Balancing arcade-style minigames with traditional platforming gameplay in Course 15
