## Game Development Process
- The game is nearing completion: "most most of everything is done" with some levels waiting on dependencies to be finished
- Currently working on course 14, specifically a space city area with concert halls and space taxis
- The level design incorporates story elements with acts/phases - in the first act, shy guys are scared and hiding, and after beating the boss in the second act, they come out and drive flying cars
- Kaze mentions working "as efficient as possible" and that he's "halfway done by this time" compared to previous projects
- References a previous project ("our compact") that was completed in "one and a half weeks or like two weeks"

## Personal Insights
- Strong opposition to PC ports: "If I had the ability to just like slip my fingers and the PC port would be out of existence, I would do it"
- Self-deprecating about his own visual effects work: "Maybe my own VFX is just complete dogshit. And that's why I'm always so impressed by the VFX in other people's games"
- Philosophy on modern game design: "I think that's key the key to modern game design you want to make something that is linear, but isn't it?"
- Frustration with repetitive questions: "If you get asked 15 questions a minute, you would feel the same way about answering questions at some point"
- Complex relationship with criticism: "I like hating on things, but I don't like if other people join me and hating on those things. Because then I feel like a bully"

## Collaborator Information
- Badub (also spelled Badoob): Composer for the game, "Badoob is doing the music. I can't do music at all"
- Biobak (also spelled Biobank): Graphics artist who "goes over my models. After I'm done. And polishes them up. Brings a lot of ideas. And new concepts to the table"
- Zeina: Created character models including Peach and Toad, responsible for animations - "You made this Peach by the way, if you don't remember, I think you also wanted to do the animation so I left that for you"
- Other Contributors: 
  - Unnamed editor: Paid $500 for video editing work
  - Alexado/Alex: Expressed interest in creating a PC port - "Alexado said he wanted to maybe make a PC port of RTYI"
  - Dory: Working on "our compact" project, doing "probably 70% of the work" including graphics, combiners, UV mapping, and programming

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Creating a gramophone-shaped concert hall in the space city area
- Implementing dynamic lighting that makes Mario light up based on floor illumination
- Designing flying cars for Shy Guys that fit the aesthetic while maintaining low poly count
- Making platforming sections that are challenging but not frustrating - noted that one area "feels way too difficult to get up on"
- Balancing visual effects with N64 hardware limitations: "We obviously do not have the computing power. To actually reflect the stars"
- Creating levels that feel open while being structurally linear for better game flow

## Business Aspects
- YouTube revenue: "$940" with editor costs of "$500" leaving "$400"
- Primary income from Patreon: "Plus, of course, Patreon. That's the majority of my income. From bar 64 hacking"
- Financial reality of ROM hacking: "What I pay him is like not fair. For the amount of work he does. But what I pay him is also not fair. For the amount of work I do. There's just not really much money in role making"
- ROM hacking transitioned from hobby to part-time job: "in 2022, I got a job as a programmer as well... this is not my full-time job anymore. So kinda it is a hobby, but also it's more like a part-time job on top of my full-time job"

## Key Quotes
- "I think that's key the key to modern game design you want to make something that is linear, but isn't it? Yeah I There's going to be a space taxi to take you over here"
- "There's just not really much money in role making. So what can we do?"
- "People have never been able to update on PC ports, is this true? People are going to be so annoying about the PC port"

## Potential Interview Topics
1. The collaborative process - How did the team form and how do responsibilities get divided between Kaze, Biobak, Badub, and other contributors?
2. The financial sustainability of ROM hacking - How does the team balance passion projects with financial realities?
3. Design philosophy for "Return to Yoshi's Island" - How do they create levels that feel open while maintaining linear progression?
4. Technical innovations and limitations - What unique solutions have they developed to push the N64 hardware?
5. The relationship between ROM hacking and the broader gaming community - Views on PC ports, preservation, and accessibility
