## Game Development Process
- Currently refactoring the RTYI (Return to Yoshi's Island) codebase with improved N64 compatibility and crash fixes: "I Spent some time this week Refactoring some of the RTUI code base. I Got it working on n64 again Fixed a lot of crashes. The game is a lot more stable. Now. I'm pretty happy with it."
- 13 levels completed so far (12 main levels plus side levels), with boss levels and two side levels still needed
- Replaced first overworld with a new debug overworld
- Game planned to have 180 stars total with 7 stars per level
- Runs at near 60 FPS on real Nintendo 64 hardware
- Estimated 2-3 years remaining in development
- Transitioned from assembly programming to C after Mario 64 decompilation project (2018-2019)

## Personal Insights
- Views game development as extremely challenging: "Making this game is honestly like scaling 50 Everests. That pretty much encapsulates how I feel about making video games."
- Philosophy on ROM hacks: "But to me, games is about experiencing new ideas and concepts. And I don't really get that from [generic ROM hacks]"
- Considers feedback about game design carefully, particularly regarding maintaining Mario 64's core design philosophy while innovating
- Works on the project weekly: "I just work on it like once a week at most"

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: No relevant information found in this transcript
- Biobak: Provides graphics suggestions, suggested the ice minions concept that was implemented for Ravens: "You mean like pop out of ground, walk forwards, around the corner and then just disappear back in? Yeah, that would be so much easier. All right, I'm not doing that. It's cooler and easier to program."
- Zeina: Handles model creation and animations, sent Raven models, created dilly-dally animation
- Other Contributors:
  - Lila/Leela: Works on Fast64 tools, mentioned in context of code issues
  - Dan Salvato: Provides game design consultation, specifically discussed dive jump mechanics
  - Michi: Contributed functions that were integrated into the codebase
  - Diamond: Briefly mentioned as a viewer/contributor

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Major design debate about dive jump mechanics: "So I talked to Dan Salvato and he said that the dive jump we have is kind of like against the design of Mario 64 and I can kind of see it. The thing is, this lets you change your angle in midair and nothing else in Mario 64 does."
- Transformed Ravens from traditional walking enemies to ice creatures that pop out of the ground based on team suggestions
- Focus on maintaining 60 FPS performance through optimizations like frame buffer memory segmentation
- Ice level designed as "surreal ice palace with some mindfuck stuff going on"
- Enemies designed with specific damage values (e.g., ice Ravens do 2 damage)

## Business Aspects
- No relevant information found regarding marketing, funding, or distribution plans

## Key Quotes
- "Making this game is honestly like scaling 50 Everests. That pretty much encapsulates how I feel about making video games."
- "The n64 is so much stronger than people give it credit for"
- "We did program all the mods in assembly until 2018-2019, but then the Mario 64 DECOM project came out and we no longer need to do this"

## Potential Interview Topics
- The transition from assembly programming to C and how the Mario 64 decompilation project changed ROM hack development
- Balancing innovation with respect for Mario 64's core design philosophy (e.g., the dive jump debate)
- The collaborative process: How suggestions from team members like Biobak transform initial design concepts
- Technical achievements in optimization that allow 60 FPS on original N64 hardware
- The long-term commitment required for a 180-star project and what sustains motivation over years of development
