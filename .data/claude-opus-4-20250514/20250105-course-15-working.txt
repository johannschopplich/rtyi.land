## Game Development Process
- Released second demo featuring only course 1: "I released the second demo today... Keep in mind the demo is just course one. Nothing else, only the first level"
- Currently working on course 15 with significant changes: "This level has changed a lot since stream last saw it. It's extremely different now"
- Discovered technical compatibility issue: "So I found out today that my game does not boot on the EverDrive X7. So right now I'm trying a build where I invalidate the entire RAM before I boot the game"
- Iterative development approach: "It is done when it is done" (response to release timeline questions)
- Performance optimization is ongoing: "Speed gains are mostly spent on like more polygons and details, for example this area here"

## Personal Insights
- Strong rejection of conventional design principles: "I hate, I don't like color theory. I don't think color theory is real. I think it's all bullshit. I think color theory is a principle made goal, that doesn't actually function as a goal"
- Philosophical approach to social interactions: Extended discussion about Immanuel Kant's categorical imperative regarding asking "how are you"
- Uncertainty about audience reception: "I really wasn't sure if that video would do well at all because it's like too high tech. But so far it seems to be doing well"
- Design philosophy for movement: "You're not supposed to be using it all over the place. It's supposed to be like, man, I fucked up. I'm gonna use the spin and I'm gonna feel ashamed for it"

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: No relevant information found
- Biobak: Mentioned as potential texture contributor: "I'm sure Biomec can find a better texture for what I'm trying to convey in here"
- Zeina: No relevant information found
- Other Contributors: 
  - Aza/Esa: Collaborating on SimpleFlips hack entry ("Is there any progress on our SimpleFlips entry thing?")
  - SimpleFlips: Mentioned multiple times in context of collaborative hack
  - Various stream viewers actively contributing design suggestions (squid boss concept came from viewers)

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Major theme decision for course 15: "the theme for this is like retrofuturism. So we want this to look like a space colony as imagined in 1960"
- Boss design evolution through community input: Started as "the blob" inspired by 1950s movies, changed to squid/octopus with rifts and tentacles based on viewer suggestions
- Movement restrictions for balance: "I keep forgetting I changed it so you can only spin or ground pound dive at any time. Because otherwise the movement is too broken"
- Visual feedback systems: "The rift could be really bright and we could use dynamic lights to shine light onto Mario so the player knows where the attack is coming from"
- Level design philosophy: "the idea is that while you do star 1, you get teased with all the other stars so you can find them"

## Business Aspects
- No direct business discussions found
- Indirect reference to monetization concerns: Discussion about copyright strikes affecting SimpleFlips' ability to monetize content
- Demo release strategy appears informal: Released without much fanfare, planning full playthrough video for following day

## Key Quotes
- "I don't think color theory is real. I think it's all bullshit. I think color theory is a principle made goal, that doesn't actually function as a goal, and people pretend it's a goal, but it shouldn't be."
- "the theme for this is like retrofuturism. So we want this to look like a space colony as imagined in 1960. Well, even if it's up on YouTube, that doesn't mean it's not struck, right?"
- "I'm surprised how many people wanted to play the demo. I didn't think people were really interested in the demo that much."

## Potential Interview Topics
- The evolution from traditional Mario 64 hacking to using decompilation - technical and creative freedoms gained
- Philosophy of game design: How personal beliefs about conventions (like color theory) influence creative decisions
- Community-driven development: How stream viewers actively shape boss fights and level designs in real-time
- The challenge of balancing innovative movement mechanics with playability
- Technical optimization strategies for pushing N64 hardware limits with modern design sensibilities
