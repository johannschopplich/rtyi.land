## Game Development Process
- Course 14 is nearly complete with only two areas remaining in the papercraft level
- Course 15 sub-area with saws has been finished off-stream and is "by far the most difficult area in the game"
- Currently working on the pyramid interior sub-area for Course 14 featuring eight red coins
- A demo release is planned, with consideration for a Course 1-only demo
- Original timeline targeted end of 2024, but additional polishing time has been added
- Significant off-stream progress has been made between streaming sessions

## Personal Insights
- On difficulty balance: "a little bit of difficulty is fun, which is why I made the level that's hard as it is"
- Design philosophy for the pyramid maze: "I want there to be like a moment of the player getting it... ah, this is how it works. And from then on it's not a maze anymore"
- Preference for Majora's Mask's formula: "What I really like about Zelda is all the in-between... Majora's Mask formula is perfect"
- Strong opinion on quality: "Mario 64 DS is ass"
- On game polish: "I really wanted to repolish the hack"
- Reflection on development time: "The original demo only took like 3 or 4 months. And it had 4 finished levels"

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: No relevant information found in this transcript
- Biobak: Provided design suggestions - "Biobak was saying maybe cardboard where paper is stapled onto it" regarding visual improvements for the Styrofoam sections
- Zeina: Serves as a playtester - "when Zeina played and she had trouble beating it" (testing the difficult saw area); also mentioned as having a friend named Tommy Tomato
- Other Contributors: 
  - Kinokyo: Created visual improvements - "Kinokyo made this level so pretty"

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Pyramid maze design challenge: Creating initial confusion that resolves through understanding rather than traditional puzzle-solving
- Movement mechanics: Ground pound dive is an optional move that "is never required to beat the game"
- Difficulty calibration: Concerns about Course 15 being too difficult after playtesting feedback
- Visual consistency: Ongoing decisions about materials (Styrofoam vs. cardboard with stapled paper)
- Level structure: Implementing color-coding for paths and shortcuts to help player navigation
- Technical bug discovered: BLJ (Backwards Long Jump) issue that needs fixing
- Design constraint: Everything in Course 14 must appear to be made from craft materials (cardboard, paper, etc.)

## Business Aspects
- YouTube revenue: "$900 this month. Or in a year, it's like... $10,000"
- Twitter monetization potential: "We got 1.4 million impressions. That's like, I think that's like $160 or something"
- Timeline consideration: "Like 2024? End of 2024? That's like the original timeline" with additional time added for polish
- Demo strategy: Planning a Course 1-only demo release
- Transparency about income: "I am pretty transparent about how much I make from RE64 hacking"
- Financial perspective: Monthly expenses cited as "$2,800" USD including family support

## Key Quotes
- "I want there to be like a moment of the player getting it on the blade of like, ah, this is how it works. And from then on it's not a maze anymore" - On the pyramid maze design philosophy
- "What I really like about Zelda is all the in-between... Majora's Mask formula is perfect" - On game design inspiration
- "But I'm literally insane. I don't count here" - Self-deprecating comment about spending a decade on mods without it being a job

## Potential Interview Topics
1. The design philosophy behind "confusion that resolves" - exploring how this concept evolved and its implementation across different levels
2. The collaborative process with Biobak on visual design decisions and how the craft material aesthetic was developed
3. The balance between accessibility and challenge, particularly regarding the Course 15 difficulty spike and playtesting insights
4. The influence of Majora's Mask on Return to Yoshi's Island's structure and the importance of "in-between" moments
5. The journey from hobbyist modder to potential commercial success - reflections on monetization and the future of ROM hack development
