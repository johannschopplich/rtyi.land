## Game Development Process
- Currently working on "Return to Yoshi's Island" (RTYI), a ROM hack based on Mario 64 decompilation
- Developing a snowman cave level with multiple sections including slides, platform voids, and cliff climbing areas
- Testing directly on N64 hardware using Everdrive for immediate console verification
- Planning to release a demo of course 1 to gather community feedback on physics and camera systems
- Post-ESA conference plans to create an open source project porting RTYI optimizations back to vanilla Mario 64
- Using a "greybox first, finalize later" approach to level design

## Personal Insights
- Expecting his first child (daughter named Reyna) in 5 days, which may impact streaming schedule
- Feeling mentally unclear and tired, possibly from frequent swimming sessions
- Reflects on a 4-year period of social isolation that "makes you go a bit crazy" and led to false memories
- Prefers Unreal Engine for future game development projects
- Strong opinions about staying within original N64 hardware limitations as part of the challenge
- Values the smallest details and optimizations, caring about "microseconds" of performance

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: Composer creating music for the project
- Biobak (referred to as "Mario back"): Reviews and improves 3D models after Kaze creates initial versions
- Zeina: Primary animator, creates concept art, provides general support, and is Kaze's wife/partner
- Other Contributors: 
  - Unnamed video editor being paid $16 per minute of edited video
  - Community members who "randomly contribute small things"

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Implementing anti-aliasing system that works on real N64 hardware
- Redesigning shadow system to be separate objects from Mario for better floor detection
- Adding camera shake effects to elevator sequences for immersion
- Balancing level difficulty with multiple paths for different skill levels
- Strict adherence to 64MB cartridge limitation: "Rom space is actually one of our most limited resources"
- Avoiding voice lines due to memory constraints
- Creating natural cave environments with ice themes, slides, and platforming challenges

## Business Aspects
- YouTube content schedule planned with F3 on the 27th, Matrix video around August 1st
- Hired video editor for approximately $200 per video to increase content output
- Aims to reach 1 million YouTube subscribers through increased video production
- Previous conflict with Nintendo resulted in 70 videos being taken down
- Considering creating "100 ways I improved Mario 64" style content
- No specific monetization model mentioned for the game itself

## Key Quotes
- "If I don't stay within the original limitations, am I not kind of cheating? You see the issue. I don't want to finish the game and then people are like, oh, yeah, but to use more memory, though."
- "So just so you guys know, in five days, my daughter is likely going to be born. Meaning I might not be able to stream next week."
- "I'll likely start like an open source project to do that. And then everyone can contribute to that. The idea would be to port back all of the RTUI optimizations to vanilla Mario 64."

## Potential Interview Topics
- How becoming a father during development has influenced the project's direction and timeline
- The collaborative dynamic between Kaze, Badub, Biobak, and Zeina in creating a cohesive vision
- The philosophy and technical challenges of adhering to original N64 hardware limitations in 2024
- Navigating the relationship with Nintendo and the impact of copyright strikes on the modding community
- The decision to open-source optimizations and contribute back to the Mario 64 decomp community
