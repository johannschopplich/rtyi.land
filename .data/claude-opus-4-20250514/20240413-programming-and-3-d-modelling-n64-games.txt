## Game Development Process
- The game is "just above 80%" complete with only three courses remaining (13, 14, and 15)
- Course 12 was finished off-stream, pending "a few more animations from Zena"
- Course 13 is planned as "a mysterious type ice castle, like very, very suspenseful"
- Course 14 is designed as "a space arcade" with one area already completed but kept secret
- Development follows an iterative process: "We're kinda blocking out the level here and figuring out how the jump should work. And then after that we're actually 3D modeling this."
- The stream shows active reworking of Divine Dino Domain (Course 2), completely changing problematic sections

## Personal Insights
- On development philosophy: "What you do or how I learned Blender is I opened the documentation on page one. And then I just tried every hotkey... And now it's in your brain. Now it's in there. No one can take it away from you."
- On time and money: "Look, first of all, barbers, you waste so much time. Second of all, they cost money. And third of all, I'm a guy who cares what I look like."
- On learning by doing: "Coding is pretty nice in that you can understand what most code does just by looking at it. It's made to be as understandable as possible."
- On perfectionism: "Right now we just want the platforming to be fun. And then we can think about the visuals."

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: No relevant information found in this transcript
- Biobak: No relevant information found in this transcript
- Zeyna/Zaina: Provides animations for the game ("There's a few more animations from Zena I have to put in the game"), also Kaze's partner who accidentally gave him a bad haircut during the stream
- Other Contributors:
  - Eiza: Has creative control over Course 14 content ("I have a whole area done on Course 14 that I can't show you guys. Because Eiza doesn't want me to show it")
  - AkiDev: Original coder whose work Kaze modified ("I changed your Chain Chomp code just like a week or two ago... because I wanted a second Chain Chomp in a different level")

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Major rework of existing content: "there were these leaf bolts before that would just go you through a little bit of like an almost autoscroll section... But I realized the section sucked. So now we have a little bit of a platforming playground here."
- Technical challenges: "Water hasn't been updated to the new step function yet and the old step functions are not fully supported anymore, so being in water can just crash the game."
- Difficulty balancing concerns: "I'm just worried that this is maybe too difficult for course two."
- Boss design needed: "if you guys wanna brainstorm a boss for the Ice Castle, let me know. And I'll think about it on next Saturday."
- Course 15 remains undecided: "I'm not 100 percent on course 15. Hopefully I can think of something while we work on the next two levels."

## Business Aspects
- Legal concerns limit monetization: "I also don't give out any Patreon bonuses. Because that might get me in legal trouble with Nintendo. So I stay away from that."
- YouTube revenue disclosed: "My first YouTube channel, the big one, income this month was around $450."
- Release strategy tied to content creators: "I am releasing a new mod soon... It releases as soon as SimpleFlips has played the game for his competition."
- Active YouTube optimization: Discussion about changing video titles from "HD Pokey" to "64 bits: Nintendo's biggest lie" to improve click-through rates from 7.4% to potentially 20%

## Key Quotes
