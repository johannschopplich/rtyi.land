## Game Development Process
- Game is "just over 80 percent" complete
- Currently working on course 13 (Raphael the Raven boss fight on the moon), with 15 total courses planned
- Implementing complex planetary gravity system using quaternions and matrix transformations
- ROM size is 62.6MB total, with 50.6MB being music (would be ~12MB without streamed music)
- Working on both gameplay mechanics and cutscene implementation simultaneously

## Personal Insights
- "I'm in mental pain because of bureaucracy. No, the answer is fixing all my bureaucracy bullshit. That is the only answer."
- Frustrated by polarized difficulty feedback: "the comments I get on my YouTube is either like, oh wow, this level looks way too easy, or oh wow, this level looks way too hard. No one ever says Kaze, the difficulty of this looks perfect to me."
- Considering financial aspects: "I've been thinking I should make a lot more videos. I'm gonna make more money for my family."
- Works full-time as a programmer in video game development
- Philosophy on physical health: "You gotta take care of your body. If you wanna take care of your mind."

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: No relevant information found in this transcript
- Biobak: Graphics artist who provides visual effect ideas. Kaze mentions: "Dude, Biobank, you can make this fight look so fucking cool with the background. Imagine the whole background here just rotating around." Also discussed ideas for moon obstruction effects.
- Zeina: Currently working on animations for the project. "Zeina is currently working on all the animations we need"
- Other Contributors: 
  - Okayo: Paid video editor who edited Kaze's recent YouTube video
  - Unknown contributor who created initial version of something Kaze modified: "I think Zeyna made it. I just made some small changes to make sure it works better here."

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Implementing dynamic difficulty: Boss slows down progressively after shockwave attacks to ensure all players can eventually win
- Boss mechanics: Increases in size when hit, speeds up, spawns meteors and shockwaves
- Struggled with returning Mario from moon after boss fight - considered pipes, trampolines, wing cap, ultimately decided star spawns directly on moon
- Technical challenge with hitbox scaling: "The scale of Raphael Raven was too small. He was scaling down so far that his hitbox was 0."
- Balancing between Yoshi's Island references and avoiding too much similarity to Mario Galaxy
- Boss gets bigger with each hit to make it easier to target while also increasing speed for difficulty balance

## Business Aspects
- Pays for video editing services: "It's someone I paid to edit the video. And hopefully he can edit the next few videos for me."
- Considering increased YouTube content creation for income: "I'm thinking I will just pump out a lot of videos."
- Offers personalized coaching as a paid service: "if you want personalized coaching by me you will have to pay"
- Planning educational content about ROM hacking techniques: "how does the BLG in R64 work? Or how do the paintings work?"

## Key Quotes
- "You guys have no idea how fucked programming this was. They don't have velocities, they have turn speeds."
- "Everyone will think of Mario Galaxy when they see this. But it's Yoshi's Island. This is very clearly a Yoshi's Island boss fight."
- "if someone figures out a way to ground pound the egg without triggering the bossfight before then they deserve to just get the star like that and skip the bossfight"

## Potential Interview Topics
- The challenge of balancing difficulty for a diverse audience while maintaining artistic vision
- Technical innovations in implementing planetary gravity on N64 hardware and how it pushed the limits of the decompilation
- The collaborative process with Biobak on visual effects and how artist input shapes gameplay implementation
- The relationship between content creation/YouTube and funding independent game development
- How Yoshi's Island serves as inspiration while creating something original within the Mario 64 framework
