## Game Development Process
- Most courses are now complete with only minor elements missing: "Most of the course when we were just done now, so there really isn't much missing. There's just some dynamic lights I want to add to this area here"
- All main courses are planned with work done on each: "Yes, all the main courses are now planned and we already have some work done for each of them"
- Course progress update: Course 13 (ice castle) is "basically done", Course 14 (craft world) is "mostly done", Course 15 (space arcade) is described as "a pathway"
- Two-demo release strategy planned, with the second demo containing only course one
- Active debugging and testing during development, particularly with lighting and spawn issues

## Personal Insights
- Strong focus on avoiding player frustration: "Imagine this situation imagine you have not bought the radar and you're doing a mission 7 and the game doesn't give you any hint at All that's gonna suck That's gonna be a miserable experience people are gonna hate that and I want to avoid that experience happening to anyone"
- Confidence in coin system design: "Trust me the coins are not gonna feel worthless the coins are gonna feel very cool They're gonna feel more valuable than Mario Odyssey"
- Commitment to iterative design based on feedback: "The problem with the radar is um someone brought up the linking the blinking might be a little bit distracting"
- Values convenience but maintains critical perspective on tools: Expresses frustration with Parallel Launcher's frequent updates while acknowledging need to test compatibility

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: No relevant information found in this transcript
- Biobak: Working on graphical elements - "there is a line of mushrooms that my bike is working on that I need to put in"
- Zeina: Mentioned at the beginning of stream ("Zena in the house") but no specific contributions discussed
- Other Contributors: No additional contributors mentioned

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Implemented a Sonic Adventure 1-inspired radar system for finding Yoshi/egg coins with proximity-based blinking
- Changed from 6 to 7 stars per level, with the 7th star always being "find the egg coins"
- Made radar automatic rather than purchaseable to prevent player frustration
- Coins will have world-changing functionality: "maybe there will be a guy that wants to build a bridge But he needs a donation of 500 coins to buy the materials. So you give them the money and then the overall changes"
- Removed 100 coin missions: "100 commissions do not exist anymore"
- Technical challenge with dynamic lights not spawning due to beep harm free value being set to 255
- Experimentation with radar visual design (transparency, color coding, blinking patterns)

## Business Aspects
- Demo release strategy: "There will be a second demo and the second demo will be only course one"
- Awareness of potential exploits: "if someone finds a way to make a patch to walk to levels that aren't in the demo the game is going to crash Because the levels are not gonna be in the demo"

## Key Quotes
- "You're actually gonna affect the world by giving people money That's gonna be so cool"
- "I only use parallel launcher to test if my game works on power launcher because I will never personally myself use power launcher"
- "bad programmers care about the programming language... c can already do everything we need"

## Potential Interview Topics
- The evolution from traditional Mario 64 star collection to the innovative Yoshi coin radar system - what inspired this change and how did it develop?
- The philosophy behind the coin economy system and how it will transform the game world - can you provide more examples of world changes players can purchase?
- The collaborative process with Biobak, Badub, and Zeina - how do you coordinate work and maintain a cohesive vision?
- Technical challenges unique to ROM hacking and working within the constraints of the N64 hardware
- The decision to remove 100 coin missions and how this reflects broader design philosophy changes from the original Mario 64
