## Game Development Process
- Currently working on Course 14 out of 15 main courses, with Course 15 already halfway complete
- Still need to complete side levels, overworld, and Bowser levels
- Demo in development with Biobak working on Course 1 remake specifically for it
- Development involves iterative testing and optimization, particularly focused on N64 hardware performance
- Real-time problem solving during stream (fixing crashes, adjusting frame rates)

## Personal Insights
- Views YouTube content creation as "the job part" while game development is "the fun part"
- Shows perfectionist tendencies - uncomfortable making certain videos until fully understanding technical aspects: "I'm not entirely comfortable making this video yet, because there's so much RSP stuff I don't understand yet"
- Open about development process with community: "Maybe I'm unprofessional for talking about this. Fuck it. Who cares? You guys are special. You guys get the special treatment"
- Takes community suggestions seriously but maintains creative vision
- Concerned about maintaining quality and avoiding "unfinished" looking elements

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: No specific mentions in this transcript
- Biobak: Currently working on Course 1 remake for the demo version
- Zeina: No specific mentions in this transcript (though "Eiza" is mentioned in relation to Course 15 slide deck - possibly same person)
- Other Contributors: 
  - Sauron: Working on RSP (Reality Signal Processor) optimization
  - Unnamed YouTube video editor: Recently hired, no longer editing videos himself
  - Community members: Actively contributing suggestions during stream for level design

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Course 14 designed as craft/cardboard themed level with paper craft materials
- Key design elements include: glue hazards that slow movement, cardboard mountains, scissor enemies, tape details, painted backgrounds
- Major challenge: Making open level design run well on N64 hardware due to performance constraints
- Struggling with death floor/bottom design - wants to avoid making it look walkable like a desk
- Aesthetic goal: Make it look "like someone actually made this" with intentional imperfections
- Rejected ideas: Origami enemies, toy elements (to avoid making it seem like a "kid's level")

## Business Aspects
- Recent YouTube video performing exceptionally well: "80% more views than my last video... This might be a 1 million view banger"
- Recommends Chinese knockoff Everdrives as affordable way to play ROM hacks on real N64 hardware
- Planning ~20 different video ideas including topics on N64 optimization, beta assets, and development progress
- Considering video length strategy: "the algorithm on YouTube likes a lot if you have like 30 minute videos. Or even longer than that"
- No direct monetization or release plans mentioned in this transcript

## Key Quotes
- "Oh yes, we're only at quest 14 out of 15. But of course there's some side levels missing, the overworld and the bowser level. But quest 15 is also already halfway done because I already programmed all the assets for it"
- "This level is gonna be very difficult to make run well on N64 because of how open it is"
- "I want this to look like someone actually made this. So there has to be a seam somewhere. Because this is what it would be like if someone made this"

## Potential Interview Topics
1. The balance between content creation obligations and passion for game development - how does managing a YouTube channel impact the development process?
2. Technical innovation and optimization for N64 hardware - what breakthroughs have enabled this ambitious project?
3. Collaborative development process - how do team members like Biobak and Sauron contribute to the project remotely?
4. Design philosophy behind themed courses - what drives the creative decisions for unique levels like the craft/cardboard world?
5. Community engagement and transparency - how does streaming development live influence design decisions and project direction?
