## Game Development Process
- Currently working on Course 14, a craft/diorama-themed level made entirely of craft materials (cardboard boxes, paper mushrooms, toilet paper rolls, crayons, rulers)
- Testing builds on real N64 hardware to ensure performance (mentions achieving around 50 FPS with optimizations)
- Plans to release a demo "soon" that will be "somewhat public" but limited to Course 1
- Achieved technical optimization by saving 30 instructions on graph render, with additional improvements to shadow functions
- Level design process involves drawing out multiple paths through the level to ensure non-linear gameplay
- Using Blender for 3D modeling and Fast64 for N64 compatibility

## Personal Insights
- "I'm self-employed" - Kaze identifies as an independent contractor rather than unemployed
- "We have the disadvantage that because we're working with the real world materials here there's a lot of... we need to get the look right because if it looks off just a little bit it's going to be very obvious that it's wrong"
- "I feel like the videos that work the best are the ones where you shit on the dev team" - regarding potential YouTube content
- "I have become a boomer by the way I installed an automatic lawnmower and I enjoy my lawnmower right now"
- Shows concern about difficulty balance: "Most players can't" do advanced moves, wants to provide easier alternatives
- "This is already gonna be a lot harder than vanilla Mario 64"

- Biobak: No relevant information found  
- Zeina: No relevant information found
- Other Contributors:
  - Lila: Active in chat/voice chat during stream, appears to be 18 years old, involved in discussions
  - Pyro: Mentioned as being in voice chat
  - Simple Flips: Owes Kaze approximately $3,500 for work but hasn't provided address for invoicing

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Creating convincing craft material aesthetics: "The seam is very important to me" - wants players to see the handmade quality
- Performance optimization challenges: "18 milliseconds RSP... the RDP is at 36.8. That means it's all the overdraw"
- Polygon budget constraints: "We're having a tight polygon budget here"
- Level layout philosophy: "This is very similar to the layout in Peaches Fury and that one was really not linear"
- Material decisions: Debating whether stapler needles are "too rough" as craft supplies that "normal people wouldn't use"
- Implementing special mechanics: Paper airplane transport, Luigi Doodle star collection, tilting cardboard bridges
- Balancing accessibility with challenge: Providing multiple paths with varying difficulty levels

## Business Aspects
- Kaze works as a self-employed contractor, including for "GFB" 
- Still accepts commissions "if they're fine paying a hefty price for it"
- Has invoicing issues with Simple Flips who owes approximately $3,500 - cannot proceed without proper address for sales tax
- Considering creating basic tutorial YouTube videos about Mario 64 mechanics for "normie" audiences as "really good easy content to produce"
- Plans for "next April 1st will be the Mr. Beast video"
- Demo release will be "somewhat public" but limited in scope

## Key Quotes
- "The materials need to look realistic to be convincing. Cause we all know wrap paper has a little bit of a shine to it. So if it doesn't have the shine, people might not identify it as wrap paper"
- "Do you guys actually think that people will complain that the game is too easy? I feel like that's an insane thing to complain about. I am not struggling enough"
- "You guys are always underestimating how difficult the game is because you're watching me and I'm so good at this game"

## Potential Interview Topics

- Technical challenges of optimizing for real N64 hardware while maintaining visual fidelity
- Philosophy on difficulty balance and accessibility in ROM hacks versus vanilla Mario 64
- The business model of self-employed ROM hack development and commission work
- Team collaboration dynamics and how contributors work together remotely
