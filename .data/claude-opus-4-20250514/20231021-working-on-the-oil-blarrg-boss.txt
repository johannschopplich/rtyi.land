## Game Development Process
- Currently working on boss fights and star select screens, with "two more star selects" remaining
- The entire overworld will undergo complete rework with a tropical island theme: "The entire overworld will be reworked, so nothing you see in the overworld is going to be the same"
- Game includes planned retro sections for Paper Mario 64, Mario Paint, Dr. Mario, Mario Land 1, and Smash 64
- Development follows specific guidelines: "In RTY I actually have the guideline that every star is exactly 300 rounds off the floor. Fun fact. Or no, every star is 200 floors, boxes are 300"
- Iterative development process with real-time testing and adjustments during stream

## Personal Insights
- Kaze prioritizes player experience over personal recognition: "The player shouldn't even know that I exist when he plays this game. That way, if in the future I get cancelled on Twitter, no one has to put down the game"
- Shows enthusiasm for visual details: "Ah! Ah! It's so good! It's so good! The twitch! It's this little tail twitch!"
- Maintains practical perspective on development: "Honestly, people say that everything in game development takes so long, but considering how big of a part this game is, and how much we just got done here, doesn't seem that much of a big deal to me"
- Values protecting contributor identities: "I will not disclose. I will protect their identity"

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges

- Technical challenge with sine wave implementation for animations causing unexpected behavior
- Visual design choices regarding fog effects, vertex colors, and transparency for underwater scenes
