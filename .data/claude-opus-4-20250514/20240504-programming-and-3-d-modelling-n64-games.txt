## Game Development Process
- Currently working on designing an ice castle level, struggling with achieving the right visual aesthetic within N64 limitations
- Developing a new operating system for Nintendo 64 to replace Nintendo's original: "I have been working on something exciting off stream. And that is a new operating system for the Nintendo 64... Basically, the operating system Nintendo wrote for Mario 64 sucked. And then later they wrote one called Libultra, and it still sucks. So I'm just gonna write a better one."
- The game will have 15 levels total: "this is the last quest 13 and there's gonna be 15 just like the original game"
- Shows extensive iterative design process, experimenting with multiple visual approaches for the ice castle throughout the stream

## Personal Insights
- Shows perfectionism about visual quality: "I just don't like how this level looks at all... I think this just looks like garbage like all around. And we need something different entirely."
- Philosophy on art and emotion: "I think art is about making you feel emotion. And if I made a track like that, I would want to make you feel pure hatred."
- Technical confidence: "I finally figured out how to properly just program an assembly. We are free, dude. We have been freed from the oppression that compilers have caused us."
- Acknowledges this is a passion project while working professionally at Gears for Breakfast game studio

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: No direct mentions in this transcript
- Biobak: Graphics artist who needs to be able to work with the models being created. Kaze considers his input crucial: "If Biobank says this is unworkable, and Biobank has to be able to work on a model too, then we can't just use it."
- Zeina: Sent reference images for ice castle design during the stream. Kaze jokes about her making him "celebrate her birthday every day"
- Other Contributors: 
  - "The dupe" - Created music for the ice castle level, uploaded songs before the stream
  - "XPM" - Sent texture files during the stream to help with ice castle visuals
  - "Lila" - Provided technical assistance with Blender geo nodes during the stream

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Technical limitations of N64 prevent transparent effects: "I can't do transparent stuff unfortunately at least not easily"
- Removed fog to enable vertex alpha usage: "We actually removed the fog entirely so we can use the vertex alpha if you have fog you can't use vertex alpha"
- Struggling to find the right balance between visual appeal and technical feasibility for ice castle aesthetics
- Considering various approaches including ice spikes, snow-covered surfaces, and hexagonal patterns
- Collision system improvements: "my new collision system is a lot more stable than the vanilla one"

## Business Aspects
- Kaze works professionally at Gears for Breakfast game studio: "I work at Gears for Breakfast. Disclaimer that all opinions that I share online are not the opinions of the studio I work for."
- Twitch streaming generates minimal income: "I think on Twitch I make like 50 bucks a month. Not a good amount."
- No specific mentions of marketing, funding, or release plans for the ROM hack

## Key Quotes
- "We can't just be like, oh, first thing that looks good, let's jump on it. Right now, we are exploring the space of possibilities and trying to get something that we can work with in the future that looks good."
- "Basically, the operating system Nintendo wrote for Mario 64 sucked. And then later they wrote one called Libultra, and it still sucks. So I'm just gonna write a better one."
- "I think art is about making you feel emotion."

## Potential Interview Topics
- The technical innovation of creating a custom N64 operating system and how it enhances ROM hack development
- The collaborative workflow between team members (Kaze, Biobak, Zeina, etc.) and how design decisions are made
- Balancing perfectionism with technical limitations - when to compromise and when to push boundaries
- The creative process behind translating Yoshi's Island aesthetics into the Mario 64 engine
- How working professionally in game development influences the approach to this passion project
