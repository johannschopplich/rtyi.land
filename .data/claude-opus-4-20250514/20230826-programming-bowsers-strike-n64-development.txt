## Game Development Process
- Project has been in development for approximately 2.5 years ("I've been working on this for maybe like 2 and a half years. Something like that. Maybe a bit longer.")
- Currently working on a protest level featuring Bowser's minions striking against poor working conditions
- Achieved significant performance improvements, now getting 25-27 FPS on N64 for complex levels ("But yeah, we actually get decent FPS now. Isn't that cool?")
- Implementing multi-act mission structure with different objectives for each act
- Active iteration based on feedback during live development streams

## Personal Insights
- Strong stance against adding random memes to games: "I think just adding random memes to your hacks is just cringe. Unless it's specifically a meme hack, you should not do it."
- Values performance optimization and technical excellence
- Competitive gaming background: "I literally won the European Championship for this game twice. I'm a fucking pro gamer."
- Believes in allowing translators creative freedom with puns and jokes
- Considers long-term ambitious projects like developing an Ocarina of Time hack with a professional studio structure

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: No specific mentions in this transcript
- Biobak: Created oil block 3D model and textures, actively contributes dialogue ideas during stream ("Biobank's giving us better answers than GenGBD. Biobank's just naturally good at coming up with phrases."), created angry Koopa eye textures
- Zeina: Working on complex Wiggler animations, delivered finished Goomba builder animations including walk cycles, sitting animations, and protest animations ("That's too bad, I sent over some finished animations.")
- Other Contributors: Active community members providing real-time feedback during streams including Lula/Leyla (possibly translator), and various stream viewers

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Redesigned oil block appearance after criticism that it looked like "a brick of shit"
- Implementing protest scene with appropriate animations and dialogue for different character types
- Performance optimization challenges: "The thing is, there isn't really any good thing to cull here. Because really what you need to cull is only what's visible in your laggiest camera setting."
- Balancing humor with age-appropriate content: "Pain in the asphalt? No one's gonna... A little kid's gonna look at that and be like, oh, haha, asphalt."
- Designing boss fight mechanics with cutscene integration
- Using AI (ChatGPT) to generate dialogue ideas, then refining them

## Business Aspects
- Plans to sell physical merchandise: "I might sell, like, OST cartridges with just the songs of RTYI. And I'm definitely gonna sell, like, boxes and instruction booklets and all that."
- Aware of trademark issues: "Yoshi is probably trademarked, all the characters are trademarked, you're gonna have to make a box with no name and no characters."
- Firm stance on not selling game cartridges: "Cartridges will never be sold."
- Considering adding multiplayer functionality after implementing Quaternion animations
- Plans to consult lawyers regarding merchandise legality

## Key Quotes
- "Found a lot of little things to improve. This game also seems a lot more consistent than N64 now."
- "I was thinking we should develop like an Ocarina of Time hack. But instead of developing it like normally, we'll do it like a professional game studio."
- "How to manage difficulty considering my experience? Playtests. You can also just play on N64 with 500 milliseconds of lag, and it kind of helps you gauge difficulty."
