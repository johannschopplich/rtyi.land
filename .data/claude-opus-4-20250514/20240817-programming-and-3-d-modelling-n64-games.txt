## Game Development Process
- Currently polishing course 1 for a demo release planned within 3-4 weeks to 8 weeks maximum
- "I am thinking of releasing a demo with just course 1, and then in this demo, this is all about the new physics and stuff, we want reviews from the player"
- Has hired an editor which enables weekly video releases: "that's the awesome part about having an editor, I can make so many videos now, I'm gonna try to make like one video every week"
- The demo will include a questionnaire asking players about camera controls, physics, and bugs: "I will release this together with a questionnaire, this will be a google doc"
- Working on implementing a growing plant mechanic to replace a pipe entrance

## Personal Insights
- Recently became a father to a 4-week-old daughter: "I had a daughter spawned in just four weeks ago"
- Experiencing cognitive fatigue: "I don't know what's up with me recently, but I've started to feel like my brain is really stupid for some reason... maybe I was just stressed out for so long that my brain functionality is temporarily reduced"
- Strong preference for natural, intuitive game design: "When you make stuff like that, you can't just turn it into puzzles. You have to make it feel really natural"
- Only speaks German to his daughter to ensure bilingual upbringing
- Frustrated with software changes: "This new Blender vertex thing. Dude, it's so annoying and bad"

- Zeina: No relevant information found
- Other Contributors:
  - Violet: Contributed design ideas, mentioned as suggesting something about the level design
  - Lila/Lila3TV: Active collaborator/moderator who helps with technical issues, 17 years old, Portuguese and English speaker, appears to be involved in fixing technical problems
  - Unnamed video editor: Recently hired to help increase video production frequency

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Modified sliding physics: "usually in vanilla Mario 64 the sliding is hard capped at 100 speed... I soft capped it at 95, so when you're above 95 you asymptotically approach 95 by like 5% every frame"
- Removed 100 coin stars: "no 100 coin stars i hate 100 coin stars in hex most of the time... it's replaced by yoshi coins you just need to collect six"
- Implementing accessibility features: "The game is mostly colorblind friendly. We're looking for colorblind people a little bit. And deaf people too"
- Struggling with color choices and visual design: "something about the colours here just look really good, I think this is really colourful, but the colours don't really pop"
- Converting a pipe entrance to a growing plant mechanic inspired by Yoshi's Island: "what if we do this we have an animated flower bud here... when you try it mario does the bowser animation and you have to either like hold the stick back or mash a to pull it out"

## Business Aspects
- Planning increased video upload frequency: "I will start increasing my upload frequency around December"
- Demo will be free with community feedback component
- Joking acknowledgment of no monetary expectations: "I will send you 0.01% of the money the game makes off of sales, which is zero"
- Focus on gathering player data before full release: "I want more data on gameplay. I want more feedback for how people think the physics work and how the camera works"

## Key Quotes
- "When you make stuff like that, you can't just turn it into puzzles. You have to make it feel really natural."
- "I want more feedback for how people think the physics work and how the camera works and stuff like that. So that when I release the full game, we know for sure people like the camera and the physics."
- "With great power comes great responsibility, or whatever Spider-Man says" (regarding modern game development complexity)

## Potential Interview Topics
- The transition to parenthood while developing an ambitious ROM hack - how has having a newborn affected development priorities and workflow?
- The decision to implement soft physics caps vs hard caps - what drove this more nuanced approach to game feel?
- The collaborative development process with community members like Lila and Violet - how does remote collaboration work for ROM hack development?
- The philosophy of "natural" game design in the context of ROM hacking - balancing innovation with player expectations
- The strategic use of demos and community feedback in shaping the final product - how does this iterative approach differ from traditional game development?
