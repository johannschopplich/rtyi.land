## Game Development Process
- The game is approximately 90-91% complete with all map parts imported and enough room space confirmed
- Currently working on Course 15 (Astro Arcade), which is the final main course before side levels
- A demo has been released featuring Course 1, with plans to include Delfino Plaza with 8 red coins
- Beta testing is actively being conducted with multiple testers providing feedback
- After Course 15, only "a couple side levels" remain to complete the game

## Personal Insights
- Kaze shows deep concern about player experience: "So I had a funny experience with a beta test for this level here... one person had a really miserable experience with it. And it's because they never thought to walk this way."
- Expresses pride in recent work: "Dude, we just finished the next video. It's 14 minutes long and it's a banger. I think this is the best video on my channel yet."
- Philosophical approach to game design: "I think the beauty in competitive games is to get complex interactions out of simple rules."
- Shows frustration with Nintendo's policies: "Well, I can't make physical cartridges because Nintendo will literally murder me and take everything I own."

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: Composer who handles sound effects and music; Kaze mentions players could contact him for media files of unused sound effects
- Biobak: Graphics artist actively working on visual concepts for arcade elements during the stream
- Zeina: Animator who briefly appears in stream with her baby; Kaze mentions she handles animations
- Other Contributors: 
  - Layra: Asked to create "the bowser thing" but Kaze had already moved past that level
  - Unnamed contributor who created the overworld model
  - Three beta testers who provided crucial feedback on Course 3

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Major issue with player navigation: Beta testers couldn't find the main path in Course 3, leading to redesign considerations
- Careful to avoid Sonic comparisons: "I don't want people to say this is Sonic... We're going to make it not Sonic."
- Implementing Mario 64's design philosophy: "That's why all the Mario 64 levels are designed the way they are. They have a very clear forward. That gets you through like 80% of the level."
- Technical challenges with flipper mechanics and ensuring proper physics for pinball-style gameplay
- Difficulty balancing: "All the Retropipers in the demo are too difficult, I think"
- Unanimous positive feedback on new controls and camera system from all testers

## Business Aspects
- Release planned potentially before Christmas: "The release before Christmas, sure. I will release this together with the spirit of the Christmas past."
- Cannot produce physical cartridges due to Nintendo copyright concerns
- Careful planning needed for release trailer to ensure fair use protection: "I feel like Nintendo is going to try to take that down. So I really, really need to make sure it's fair use"
- Free release planned with warning screen for anyone who paid: "there will be a screen that's going like if you bought this game for money, you've been scammed"

## Key Quotes
- "I think the overall conclusion is the player really needs to be guided to Star 1 a lot more. I think this is something they do in Mario 64 a lot, where they make it very obvious how to get to the first star"
- "How complete it is depends entirely on how you define completion. That's a good argument to be made. It's like 90% or even more... But we have all the MPs imported now, so we have enough room space for sure."
- "Oh also unanimously, everyone that played the demo thought that the new controls and camera were great. That's really good, I'm really happy with that."
