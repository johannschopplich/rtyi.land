## Game Development Process
- All main courses are nearly complete, with course 15 being the final one
- After completing main courses, development will shift to "polishing content" and extensive beta testing
- The game currently sits at 58.8 megabytes, fitting comfortably on a 64MB cartridge
- Each level features a "retro section" - course 15's retro section is Mario 64 themed
- Development includes guest authors contributing side levels
- Stream shows active development of boss fights, VFX implementation, and level design planning

## Personal Insights
- Kaze emphasizes the importance of "edging" the player: "I've come to realize that it's very important to constantly edge the player. So that's what we're doing. We're going to edge the player with the star at the right start, right away."
- Strong stance against excessive options: "There's one thing where I will consistently disagree with the people asking for stuff and that is options. People always ask for more and more and if I added everyone's request for options, I would have an option menu with 260 items"
- Expresses feeling overwhelmed with workload: "Dude, I'm just so fucking busy. I generally just do not have time to do anything."
- Shows excitement about reaching development milestones: "Oh my God, dude, all the main courses will be finished. That will feel so good."
- Philosophical approach to difficulty and accessibility, rejecting the idea of multiple difficulty modes

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: No specific work mentioned in this stream, but noted as someone who might play the game
- Biobak: Mentioned in context of UV mapping issues and 3D model work
- Zeina: Currently animating baby Yoshis for the boss fight - "Zayna's currently animating them. So hopefully they will be better once they are animated."
- Other Contributors:
  - Hazer: Creating a pastel-colored side level featuring wind sliding and flowers
  - Martiste: Guest author for levels (specific contributions not detailed)
  - Unnamed person: Creates YouTube shorts for $5 each, making them look like "mobile game ads"

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Boss design evolution: Changed from "tumors" to "mushrooms" growing from Yoshi after feedback that original was "way too disgusting"
- Implemented hot pipe mechanics where players must wait for safe moments to progress
- Developing a planet-based boss arena where Yoshi destroys half the planet in a dramatic entrance
- Created elaborate spaceship interior with themed rooms (computer room, specimen room, engine room, observatory)
- Planning Mario 64 retro section using floating snippets of iconic levels connected by platforming
- Technical challenges with smoke effects and performance optimization
- Memory management considerations with about half a megabyte of RAM remaining

## Business Aspects
- YouTube shorts arrangement: "I'll give you $5 per short. Go crazy. And they made a bunch of shorts that look like mobile game ads."
- Awareness of platform fees: "When you donate via YouTube, while I do appreciate it a lot, YouTube does take a large cut of it."
- Commitment to open-source release: "yes it will be open source anyway"
- No specific marketing strategy or release date mentioned

## Key Quotes
- "Polishing content is gonna feel so good after all this time."
- "I've come to realize that it's very important to constantly edge the player... they have that in mind forever. And it's like a task that they need to finish, but they can't because they can't get there."
- "I think it's made for the one person that commissioned it. Of course there's nothing like super coherent about its design goal that like would appeal to a larger audience."
