## Game Development Process
- The game contains 15 main courses with 9 boss fights distributed among them: "We have eight boss fights, nine boss fights in the main courses. That's actually kind of a lot."
- Course 13 and 14 are nearly complete: "course 13 is missing the outside area zeno wanted to work on that she's been working on it for a long time now and of course 14 is done but a lot of the visuals are like left for violet to do so it doesn't look as pretty as it should be but yeah they're basically like both 95% done"
- The project has expanded beyond initial plans: "I once had planned six side levels which would include the four cab levels but nowadays there's a good chance that it's actually going to be like nine side levels"
- Currently working on the boss for course 15, suggesting late-stage development

## Personal Insights
- Kaze maintains deliberate neutrality on controversial topics: "Generally I have no political positions for the purpose of if you there's something called the halo effect and it is that if people like you they are going to assume other good things about you"
- He values precision in communication: "I had a dream one time that people were not able to say words unless they could describe exactly what they mean... and i feel like if we lived in a world like that our lives would be so much better"
- He takes pride in hidden complexity: "there's a lot of stuff in the game that like you would only know if you looked at the code"
- Has a playful approach to development, including past pranks: "So what I did in some of my old ROM hacks is I would import the 3D model of a large cock into Castle Grounds... So if you played my hack, you would see nothing wrong. But as soon as you use a ROM hacking tool to open my hack, you would just see a large cock."

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: Mentioned as being "royalty" and "famous" on Soundcloud, suggesting his music contributions have gained recognition
- Biobak/Biowake: Working on final graphics/models - "The textures on the boss are not final, though. They're more like a symbolic representation of what I want this to look like, so that when Biowake remakes my model, he knows what I was going for"
- Zeina/Zeno: Working on animations and the outside area of course 13 - "course 13 is missing the outside area zeno wanted to work on that she's been working on it for a long time now"
- Other Contributors:
  - Akumoid: Recently joined to help with N64 shaders - "So the last few days, a person called Akumoid has been DMing with me. They wanted to learn about N64 shaders and they wanted to help me make a good shader for this. And together we came up with this one here. Look at the building now. You see the reflections on it?"
  - Violet: Responsible for visual polish on course 14
  - Doriel and Aza: Working on a separate romhack where Kaze plays the villain

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Boss mechanics designed to prevent player frustration: "players are probably gonna be like, oh man, why do I, even when I get hit, still get, like, the hardships of the thing instantly retracting? But they don't know it's for their own benefit, because I don't want them to get stuck"
- Cryptographic elements being integrated: "So I'm thinking for the yoshi boss here we're actually using some cryptographic messages that we sent the player through his text boxes and I already have two encryption techniques thought of"
- The pentapus boss has a three-phase pattern: "So you jump on his tentacle, you destroy the ward and then Yoshi gets weak. And his head goes down... And on his nose, there's more wards. So you're going up there and you punch the ward and that's dealing damage to him. He shakes you off and then you repeat that three times."
- Technical implementation of new shader effects: "And it's a super cheap effect too. You'd think this is expensive, but this is literally free. This is expensive in terms of time that developers have to spend to pull this off."

## Business Aspects
- Considering cross-platform accessibility: "I don't think an android part is like super unlikely to happen. I might legitimately just use um YSK static recompilation to properly import the game to like everything at once. So you wouldn't even need an emulator."
- Maintains awareness of audience management and personal branding through political neutrality

## Key Quotes
- "So he's a pentapose. So I had the craziest idea for easter eggs with them and I will not tell you how they work. I'll just tell you that it's a crazy idea and it's going to be awesome."
- "Yes, he is a corrupted Yoshi and you help him to become uncorrupted. And he's gonna attack you with his tentacles coming out of black holes."
- "And it's a super cheap effect too. You'd think this is expensive, but this is literally free. This is expensive in terms of time that developers have to spend to pull this off."

## Potential Interview Topics
- The evolution of the project scope from 6 to potentially 9 side levels - what drove this expansion?
- The collaborative process with artists like Biobak and Akumoid - how does remote collaboration work for ROM hack development?
- The cryptographic messages and easter eggs - what inspired this additional layer of complexity?
- The technical innovations like custom shaders on N64 hardware - what boundaries are being pushed?
- The balance between creative vision and player experience in boss design decisions
