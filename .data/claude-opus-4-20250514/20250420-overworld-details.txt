## Game Development Process
- Completed major milestone: "So, over the past week I spent a lot of time completely rewriting Mario 64's audio engine. I am now almost finished. There have been great improvements. It's a lot more memory efficient."
- Current focus on overworld development: "Our work today is here in the overworld. We already picked out a sand texture and a wall texture here. Next we want to pick out a water texture or maybe a wood texture."
- Using advanced memory capacity: "I'm not going with an 8 megabyte game, I'm going with 64 megabytes. So I'm limiting myself to end of the N64's lifespan."
- Implementing complex water system with wave physics and visual effects

## Personal Insights
- Core motivation: "What brought you to the return of the island idea, like when it becomes a selling game compound? I like Yoshi. That's kind of where the thought process ended."
- On development approach: "It's kind of crazy how easy it is to make a map look good if you just have good shaders. Or good fixed function pipelines."
- Personal life integration: Has a 9-month-old baby who "loves eating the remote" and accidentally lost 20 pounds (from 215 to 194)
- Reflection on Mario 64 hacking community: "for the longest time the Mari64 community was like such a pathetic part of the homebrew community" but acknowledges the validity of criticism about not making true N64 hacks

- Other Contributors: 
  - Robart: Referenced as creator of another hack ("I didn't make that hack. That's Robart. Go bother him.")
  - Potential texture contributor mentioned: "Dude, I definitely could use some textures. Although it's like... How are we going to put you on any specific one texture?"

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Audio engine rewrite: "I understand the whole codebase. Meaning it's going to be very easy to debug any problems that may occur. Which is very useful for the project as a whole."
- Water wave implementation challenge: "The main problem with the water is that if we add waves to it, swimming in it is going to be weird... It's going to be Marios going underwater and above water."
- Settled on 600 triangles for water after testing various options (from 370 to 16,000): "It's only 600 triangles, and I haven't even removed the invisible ones yet."
- Design philosophy for waves: Implemented waves that appear to flow into the island with varying amplitude based on distance from shore
- Console compatibility: "Most of my romhacks are not console compatible. Like historically. I mean this one is"

## Business Aspects
- Legal considerations: "So I think we're fine legally to just use this in our own game now. The audio engine. Because all of it is completely different. As long as we change the way we interface with the RSP as well."
- Content creation concerns: Released an RNG video he's "very 50-50 on" because "it's not a topic that can do well"
- Streaming schedule: "Tomorrow is Easter, and I will not be able to stream. But maybe Monday or Tuesday."

## Key Quotes
- "I like Yoshi. That's kind of where the thought process ended." - On the game's core inspiration
- "It's also all my own code now. Or well, mostly all my own code... I think we're fine legally to just use this in our own game now." - On rewriting the audio engine
- "for the longest time no one really cared about making hacks console compatible. We just wanted the funny Mario going bing bing wahoo, you know." - On the evolution of ROM hacking standards
