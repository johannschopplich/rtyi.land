## Game Development Process
- Currently working on course 14, implementing a cardboard box opening mechanism that leads to a hell-themed area
- "And we did so much progress over the last few weeks that I have like 5 case clips videos ready to go"
- Significant performance optimization achieved by adjusting drawing distance settings: "The reason it ran poorly is because back from my other RoMac, I still had the drawing distance for everything set at infinite"
- Plans for 45 Yoshi bonus missions similar to Mario Galaxy's comet system: "instead of a comet appearing there's going to be a yoshi that gives you a mission where it's like do this with these special conditions and you get a star"
- Using Yoshi's Woolly World OST for the game
- Ongoing debugging of emulator-specific issues between Project64 and Nemu

## Personal Insights
- On overconfident development: "That reeks of like, I'm going to make this product and I know everything, unlike the other people and I'm going to just do it way better and then it's like, you don't know shit that now you made it worse."
- On work ethic: "I just make games. I don't keep track of that. I just make games. I don't have space in my brain to think about those things."
- On hypothetical Mr. Beast collaboration: "Mr. Beast paid me a million dollars to make a romhack. I wouldn't do it."
- Philosophy on difficulty modes: "You can just decide to play the game without collecting coins. That's the beauty of Mario 64."
- On mod completion rates: "most people don't actually notice, but most mods never get finished. It's very rare that a mod gets finished, you guys are just spoiled because you are watching me."

- Badub: No relevant information found in this transcript
- Biobak: Provided design ideas for the cardboard box opening mechanism, specifically suggesting a zipper concept that Kaze initially considered but ultimately decided against
- Zeina: No relevant information found in this transcript
- Other Contributors: 
  - Arthur: Active community member/viewer who interacts during streams
  - DeathWizard: Created a Wordle implementation in Mario 64
  - Pan and Coke: YouTuber mentioned for making comprehensive Mario 64 technical videos

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Extensive iteration on cardboard box opening mechanism: considered zipper, tape, cutting with knife/scalpel, and ultimately settled on a pull-tab design
- Implemented HD-ified Mario model with new features: "his nose jiggles... the buttons are now 3D models... everything is more higher resolution"
- Performance optimization through drawing distance adjustments and material reduction on mountains
- Debugging complex emulator-specific bugs with action states when holding objects
- Design philosophy focusing on "crafty" aesthetic while maintaining performance
- Decided against traditional hard mode, emphasizing player choice in difficulty through playstyle

## Business Aspects
- Twitter monetization success: "The Twitter monetization grind is going way better than I thought. And we hit 250k today."
- YouTube Shorts strategy acknowledged as unprofitable: "The problem is with shorts, you're never going to make the money back. No one really watches those shorts."
- Planning educational YouTube content: "I am thinking of making a video. One bug with every Mario 64 enemy."
- Considering video titles for broader appeal: "why I've been rewriting Mario 64" vs "The real reason"
- Recognition that technical explanation videos perform better over time rather than immediately

## Key Quotes
- "most mods never get finished. It's very rare that a mod gets finished, you guys are just spoiled because you are watching me."
- "I just make games. I don't keep track of that. I just make games. I don't have space in my brain to think about those things."
- "You can just decide to play the game without collecting coins. That's the beauty of Mario 64... If you want a hard mode, just play risky."
