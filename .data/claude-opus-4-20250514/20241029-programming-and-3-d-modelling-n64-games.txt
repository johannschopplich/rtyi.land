## Game Development Process
- Currently developing Course 14, which features an "Arts and Crafts stage" or "cardboard level" with a secret sub-area
- Working on platform-based level design with saws that activate when players approach, creating a race-like dynamic rather than an autoscroller
- Estimates the complete game will take 80-85 minutes for any% speedruns and approximately 3-3.5 hours for 100% completion
- Currently on Star 4 or 5 of development
- Plans to include a demo with potentially hidden Delfino Plaza N64 content

## Personal Insights
- "Look, there's two things I care about in life right now. Professionally. The first is making my video game and the second is making money. Making YouTube videos, for me, that's just a way to make money. I have very little passion for creating those."
- Expresses strong interest in potentially creating an open-world Mario 64 in the future
- Critical of modern game design, particularly Tears of the Kingdom's puzzle solutions: "The problem I have with Tears of the Kingdom is that the problems you're solving, they always work with the same solution"
- Believes speedruns become less enjoyable when they diverge too much from casual gameplay: "As soon as the game becomes unrecognizable from how the casual gameplay of the game goes, then the speedrun is not fun anymore"

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Struggling with platform scaling differences between Blender and in-game implementation: "There's clearly a large difference between how all of this is applied in blender versus in Mario 64"
- Deciding on painted/cardboard aesthetic for floor textures in the arts and crafts level
- Implementing a race mechanic where players must move quickly to avoid saws rather than traditional autoscrolling
- Balancing difficulty after playtesting - adjusted platform spacing when sections proved too challenging
- Philosophy against adding too many options: "I'm not adding options for every little baby thing. Less options is better"
- Dealing with technical issues including underflow errors and emulator compatibility problems

## Business Aspects
- Views YouTube content creation primarily as income generation rather than passion project
- Testing different content types to determine what works on YouTube: "But really, I'm just testing out what content works and what doesn't on YouTube"
- Planning an April Fools Mr. Beast parody video for next year
- Considering including bonus content (Delfino Plaza N64) hidden in the demo release

## Key Quotes
- "Speedruns of this game are going to be crazy. This game has insane speedrunning potential."
- "So the idea is I have these two platform designs and I can place these platforms as I want around the level. And there's going to be saws between the platforms. And when you get close enough to a saw, the saw starts going."
- "As soon as Most Critical talks about me, I just give up." (joking about YouTube criticism)

## Potential Interview Topics
- The balance between designing for casual players versus speedrunners and how that influences level design decisions
- The technical challenges and creative opportunities presented by working with the Mario 64 decompilation
- The relationship between content creation as a funding mechanism versus pure game development passion
- Team dynamics and collaboration methods when working with multiple contributors remotely
- The philosophy behind minimalist game options and how it shapes the player experience
