## Game Development Process
- Currently in bug-fixing phase: "I'm going through all the levels from correspond to the last person fixing all the bugs that have appeared so that we can beta test every single level"
- Game is approximately 75-80% complete with 15 planned courses total
- Currently working on Course 11 (Oil Rig underground area) 
- Development started around 2020-2022 (Kaze uncertain of exact date)
- Using self-imposed deadlines: "I started setting myself deadlines for stuff to work on right so I've done this for 14 days now and so far I fit every single deadline"
- Plans to release source code: "I do plan to have an open source, so I will need to manage all that stuff"

## Personal Insights
- Design philosophy: "I don't like modern game design. Modern game design is made for people that are depressed and just want to erase time. Not for people that want to go have an experience."
- Approach to difficulty: "I actually have a really good method for making a good difficulty curve. And that is that I don't try to make the levels more difficult. I just put the threshold of how cool a jump has to be for it to be worth the difficulty lower."
- On content creation: "I hate making videos. But I also don't know who would be a good match for that, because you need to be so technically inclined."
- Vision for speedrunning: "I want speedruns of this game to be like crazy"
- Values player time: "The game doesn't waste your time. That is important to me."

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: No direct mentions in this transcript
- Biobak: Graphics artist actively working on textures during stream, specifically helping with sail texture optimization for N64 limitations
- Zeina: No direct mentions in this transcript  
- Leila/Lila: Animator working on quaternion animations, absent for a week (stream running joke about her "death"), critical for fixing door animations
- Other Contributors: SimpleFlips mentioned as someone Kaze has created content for

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Implementing hydraulic platforms with variable speeds for industrial oil rig aesthetic
- Creating boiling oil/tar visual effects within N64 limitations
- File select designed as 3D level similar to Mario Sunshine
- Controller dead zone considerations for different platforms
- Texture optimization challenges (96x42 pixel texture resolution for sail)
- Focus on making platforming sections visually interesting with moving machinery

## Business Aspects
- Future plans: "before Yoshi's Return to Yoshi's Island finishes we're gonna start working on a game in Unreal Engine... simultaneously with the release of Return to Yoshi's Island we are going to start a Kickstarter"
- YouTube strategy includes separate channels for different content quality thresholds
- Sponsorship opportunity from Honkai Star Rail mobile game
- Christmas ad revenue importance: "The ad revenue on YouTube is so high. I'm making bank around Christmas"
- Considering RTYI soundtrack album release on N64 cartridge format
- Works full-time at Gears for Breakfast while developing RTYI
