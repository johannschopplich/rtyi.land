## Game Development Process
- Currently working on Course 11 "Frantic Fleet Factory" - a construction zone level set on an oil rig
- Already completed 10 courses, planning for 15 total courses in the game
- Development process involves deciding art style first before level functionality: "our goal today will be to decide on the art style for this level"
- Level placement is narratively significant: "This is course 11. And in the second Bowser level, which is the level right before this, you destroy his entire fleet, right? So now you go back to where the ships were actually built"
- Iterative design approach with constant refinement based on visual testing

## Personal Insights
- On the creative process: "You start making a level and you feel like, wow, this is dogshit, this is garbage, this is not working out at all. And then you get a few ideas and suddenly it's like, ah, shit, this is gonna be the best thing ever"
- On level creation difficulty: "I always find this to be the most interesting but also the hardest part of making a level and that is getting the start"
- On commitment required: "If you want to finish a Mario 64 major hack you need to be mentally ill. You cannot do it if you are not mentally ill. What kind of normal person would just make an entire hack like that for free?"
- Values conciseness in communication: "Being concise is one of the skills I value the most"

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: No direct mentions in this transcript
- Biobak: "Biobak helps with the level layouts. Or the level visuals" - actively assists with visual design decisions
- Zeina: Kaze's wife, involved in the project but was absent during stream - "Zayna is not here. Zayna has to write thank you cards for everyone who came to our wedding"
- Other Contributors: "Many, many people" contributed textures for the game; chat participants actively provide real-time feedback on design decisions

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Major pivot from lava-themed volcano level to oil rig setting for better color variety and uniqueness
- Created custom oil water effect with rainbow reflections: "The oil water effect first, because I just had a sick idea"
- Constant concern about polygon count and performance: "without making it so many polygons that the game is just gonna lag"
- Mission structure already established: includes trolling Bowser's minions, a strike scenario, power generator area, red coins, and access to Bowser's office
- Design inspired by Rico Harbor and Metal Harbor from Sonic games, but adapted for construction zone theme

## Business Aspects
- Creating YouTube content as marketing: "I'm making a new video. The video is called, this is really good clickbait, Mario64's movement is not perfect"
- Kaze has a day job coding in C++: "I'm literally paid to do that, yes"
- No monetization plans for the hack itself - created as free content
- Workplace provides mental health support and work-life balance, which he finds somewhat excessive

## Key Quotes
- "That's all graphics is, you just make up some bullshit and then it looks good"
- "This is gonna be where Bowser builds all his airships. And this is especially funny, because this is course 11. And in the second Bowser level, which is the level right before this, you destroy his entire fleet"
- "Being concise is one of the most important skills in the world. Being concise is one of the skills I value the most. The more concise you can be with your words, the more information you can put into a single sentence, the cooler it is"

## Potential Interview Topics
