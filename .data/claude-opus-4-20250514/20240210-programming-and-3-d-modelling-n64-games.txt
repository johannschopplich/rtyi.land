## Game Development Process
- The project is approximately 80% complete: "the levels are left to make after this three more main courses and two side levels and one bowser level we're like 80% of the way there"
- Kaze completely rewrote Mario 64's collision system: "I made a completely new collision system. I said, fuck Mario 64's collision. It is unusable. We have our completely own collision system now. And it's so much more stable."
- Currently working on a Monty Mole hideout area in a western/cowboy-themed level
- Progress includes completing star 1 and 2 of the current level, with star 3 being a "Goomba imposter tower"

## Personal Insights
- Philosophy on bugs: "if there's a bug in Mario 64 that you only encounter if you do it on purpose, I'll leave it in the game. But if it can happen on accident, I'll remove it."
- Approach to criticism: "whenever I receive criticism, I try to figure out like what the person was feeling that's wrong, right? I don't really think about what they're saying as much as I think about what they were feeling"
- Design philosophy emphasizes player experience over technical perfection: "I'm not trying to prevent the BLJ. It's more so that just by making more stable physics, it just so happened to remove BLJ. And I consider that a bad thing, actually."

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: No relevant information found
- Biobak: No relevant information found
- Zeina: Brief mention that "Zayna isn't even home today" (appears to live with Kaze)
- Other Contributors: Lila - mentioned as someone in the community who hasn't finished "quaternion animations," appears to be another programmer/community member

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Created a new collision system from scratch due to limitations of Mario 64's original system
- Designing boss fight with multiple Monty Moles: "I was thinking that'd be five moles here and they'd come out and throw a rock at you and whenever you hit one there's like one less but the rest go faster"
- Struggled with physics calculations for projectile trajectories, eventually resorting to trial and error
- Decision to maintain certain bugs (like BLJ) if they require intentional player action to trigger
- Western/cowboy theme for current level influences design choices (rejecting ideas like tanks or hard hats that don't fit the theme)

## Business Aspects
- Plans for post-release: "alongside the release of return to your silent I'll probably launch like a Kickstarter for my own game and then transition to working on that"
- Intention to hire collaborators: "hopefully I can hire some other rom hackers to work on it with me"
- Has experience with sponsorships on YouTube channel, mentioning rates of $1,000-$5,000 depending on placement

## Key Quotes
- "I said, fuck Mario 64's collision. It is unusable. We have our completely own collision system now. And it's so much more stable."
- "The more someone criticizes something and looks at something, the more media you consume, the worse you get at criticizing it. Because you start identifying things that you think makes this piece of media good. And you're no longer just talking about the feelings the piece of media evokes."
- "we're like 80% of the way there"

## Potential Interview Topics
1. The decision to completely rewrite Mario 64's collision system - what specific limitations led to this major technical overhaul?
2. The philosophy of intentionally preserving certain bugs as features - how does this affect the overall game design and player experience?
3. The transition from ROM hacking to original game development - what lessons from this project will carry over to the Kickstarter project?
4. The collaborative process - how are tasks divided among team members (Badub, Biobak, Zeina) and how is creative vision maintained?
5. The influence of western/cowboy themes on level design - how are thematic elements integrated into gameplay mechanics?
