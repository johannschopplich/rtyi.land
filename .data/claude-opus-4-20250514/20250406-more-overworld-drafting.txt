## Game Development Process
- Currently working on overworld sections (parts 13-15), with the island overworld now complete as a 360-degree explorable environment
- Major milestone reached: "The island is now complete. 360 degrees. You can go everywhere on this island. You can see every single square foot of land on this island."
- Implementing an overworld map system that will appear in the pause menu, showing a bird's eye view of explored areas
- Still need to implement 8 secret stars throughout the overworld
- Development includes regular streaming sessions once or twice a week
- The overworld design emphasizes interconnectedness, with early areas providing glimpses of later locations to create anticipation

## Personal Insights
- Expresses concern about recent video reception: "Man, today's video got a lot more negative reception than I thought it would get. I thought people would really like it. But so far people have been hating it."
- On his development philosophy: "Fun is not really something I think about when I make stuff."
- Feels mentally exhausted during streaming despite initial enthusiasm
- Has strong opinions about game preservation and porting methods, preferring static recompilation over PC ports
- Plans to eventually move into commercial game development: "I definitely want to make commercial video games at some point. I think I have to move to that eventually."
- Views himself as "just a crazy man with a hacks editor" rather than formally educated in programming

  - Wiseguy: Creator of static recompilation technology who may port the finished mod
  - Daryl and Isa: Collaborated on R64 Chaos Edition featuring Kaze as the antagonist

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Struggling with overworld scale: "This entire overworld feels like it's scaled up by a factor of 2. And it's terrible."
- Developed rain flower concept to solve persistent rain area: "In part 13 there is a blue sun flower. She's sad and that's causing rain to happen all around her. She's sad because the Yoshis are sad."
- Design philosophy for stars: "I want every star in the overworld to kind of transform the overworld in a way."
- Rejected initial Peach rescue scenario in favor of more integrated storytelling
- Implementing Bowser's Builders subplot where they desert due to poor working conditions and OSHA violations
- Created interconnected progression where players unlock new areas through items found in previous sections
- Emphasis on environmental storytelling and world transformation rather than simple collectibles

## Business Aspects
- Currently has Squarespace sponsorship requiring 6 videos in 3 months: "they pay really well, and I need money"
- R64 Chaos Edition was his first game to gain popularity, discovered by many through Vinesauce
- Considering future commercial game development, potentially using Godot or Unreal Engine
- Has experience with Unreal Engine through his day job
- Resells games after playing them as a personal practice

## Key Quotes
- "The island is now complete. 360 degrees. You can go everywhere on this island... Isn't that fucking cool? To have an overworld like that, where you can literally go everywhere?"
- "I want every star in the overworld to kind of transform the overworld in a way. So maybe Peach shouldn't just be visiting the island. Maybe she should have some kind of issue that you help her with."
- "Back then I was just like a dude making Mario hacks and now people know me as the optimization guy. But I'm still just a dude making Mario hacks to be honest."

## Potential Interview Topics
1. The evolution from hobbyist ROM hacker to recognized optimization expert - how has this shift in public perception affected development approach and personal identity?
2. The design philosophy of transformative gameplay elements versus traditional collectibles - what drives this preference for meaningful world changes?
3. The balance between creative vision and audience expectations - how does negative reception impact development decisions?
4. The technical journey from ROM hacking to potential commercial game development - what skills and perspectives transfer between these domains?
5. Collaboration dynamics in ROM hack development - how do contributors like PixelPallava influence design decisions, and what is the process for integrating community ideas?
