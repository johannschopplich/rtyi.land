## Game Development Process
- Currently developing an ice castle level with extensive sliding mechanics and platforming sections
- Following iterative design approach: "our task for the day is to make the platforming good. And then after we made the platforming good, we can make the visuals good"
- Released a side project hack called "That time I became friends with the Royal Scuttlebug family" as a collaboration
- States "we are not doing any playtesting for a long time" - focusing on core development first
- Working within N64 hardware limitations: "I try to stay within the 64 megabytes limit because I do want to do this whole thing with the technology of the time"

## Personal Insights
- Game difficulty philosophy: "the game is as difficult as you make it... the game is as difficult as you are brave and if you're just not brave sure the game will be easy but that's honestly on you"
- Design philosophy: "I think making a game is all about designing a feeling that you want the player to have"
- On programming languages: "Programming is something you do to build something. The act of it itself should be as simple as possible"
- Cautious about AI discussion: "I'm at a point where I won't say that anything AI is cool publicly. Because I think that I will literally be murdered on twitter.com"
- Form follows function approach: "This level very much is like the form-follows-function-time deal"

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: No relevant information found
- Biobak: No relevant information found  
- Zeina: No relevant information found (Note: "Eiza" is mentioned instead, possibly a different person)
- Other Contributors:
  - Eiza: Collaborated on side project - "I did all the programming and I helped them with a bunch of shaders... But Eiza did most of his own stuff himself"
  - Dan: Consulted about ice materials/textures - "I was playing with materials a little bit more after talking to Dan"
  - Sauron: Created performance tool - "Sauron basically made a cool thing that traces when which a thread runs and for how long"
  - WiseGuy: Discussed potential PC port - "if you ever wanted we could discuss recompiling RTYI"

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Ice castle design with mirror wall mechanics for wall kicks: "you're going to wall kick off the mirror here between the wall... and it's going to look really cool"
- Camera issues in tight indoor spaces: "the camera will be an issue in tight indoor rooms like this"
- Switched from jail cells to frozen walls: "What if instead of jail cells, this is just like frozen walls and there's people behind the frozen walls"
- Implementing sliding momentum jumps as core mechanic: "I was thinking this level should have a lot of these slide jumps because I really like them"
- Balancing visual effects with N64 limitations: exploring AI upscaling possibilities for rendering at lower resolution

## Business Aspects
- Source code release strategy: "I released the source code whenever my mods done because if I release it before then I dig my whole mod"
- Maintaining hardware authenticity: "I try to stay within the 64 megabytes limit because I do want to do this whole thing with the technology of the time"
- Potential PC port collaboration with WiseGuy mentioned but not committed to

## Key Quotes
- "I think making a game is all about designing a feeling that you want the player to have and that just doesn't fit the feeling of this area."
- "the game is as difficult as you make it you always have the option to do something extremely risky extremely difficult to pull off that makes you go faster but you also have the option to take a safe route"
- "if we do both at the same time, then we're going to spend a lot of time making stuff look good that is not even going to make it into the game"

## Potential Interview Topics
- The collaborative process with Eiza and how responsibilities were divided on side projects versus the main RTYI development
- Technical innovations being explored (AI upscaling on N64, performance optimization tools, texture generation techniques)
- The philosophy behind difficulty design and player agency in ROM hacks versus traditional game design
- The decision-making process for visual design elements (frozen enemies vs jail cells, mirror mechanics)
- Balancing authenticity to N64 hardware limitations with modern development techniques and player expectations
