## Game Development Process
- The game is nearing completion with only four courses remaining after the current one, plus some side levels
- Currently working on the underground section of an oil rig level, which requires two Yoshi coins and an 8-bit pipe
- Two areas are missing in the current level, designated for the last star and final Yoshi coins
- The development showcases how optimization has allowed for more artistic freedom: "I'm gonna frame it as like look with all this optimization artists have so much more freedom and we brought more artists on board which is you and now the game is epic and amazing"

## Personal Insights
- Kaze has become increasingly conscious of difficulty balance: "when you make a romhack the criticism is always it's too difficult so i've gotten very wary of difficult i have been trying to make my games easier and easier"
- He views programming languages philosophically: "When you say you code in English instead of say you code in C, you're also saying that it doesn't matter. All the programming languages are essentially the same"
- Reflects on platform transition: "ever since i quit twitch the viewers have been dropping a lot... but we're actually getting viewers again"
- Shows a perfectionist approach to environmental design, questioning what the underground area represents thematically

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: No specific mentions in this transcript
- Biobak: Referenced as the graphics artist who will "justify it in post" regarding design decisions and material choices
- Zeina: Briefly mentioned in context of animations
- Other Contributors:
  - Duke: Composed music for Bowser that "fits to the cutscene"
  - Yoshi Milkman: Created detailed surface sounds including "wood, steel, glass, leaves, squishy surfaces like meat, and metal grates" with significant effort for perfection
  - Arthur Tilly: Theoretical discussion partner who helped with game concepts
  - Anonymous contributor: Offered to create an oil-based enemy variant of the electric ghost enemy

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Struggling with jump difficulty balance for Course 11: "doesn't this jump feel a little too difficult? I mean, I know it's course 11, but..."
- Technical texture limitations: "For the textures, you have to keep in mind we're limited to 64x64 textures"
- Environmental theming challenges: "I have a problem with this song and that is that I don't know what the theme of after I don't know what the fuck this I just know it's cool to platform on but what is it"
- Implementing glass windows to show platforms above in the underground area
- Creating interconnected underground pathways between three surface entrances

## Business Aspects
- YouTube channel showing positive growth: "every video is doing better than the previous one that's actually crazy my youtube channel is on an upwards draft"
- Strategic video framing to showcase optimization benefits and team expansion
- Monetization through YouTube views and premium: "youtube does pay me for views obviously also for people that use youtube premium"
- Previous video performance: "15k that's it's like a top three video"

## Key Quotes
- "I'm almost done with the game, too"
- "we usually when you make a romhack the criticism is always it's too difficult so i've gotten very wary of difficult i have been trying to make my games easier and easier"
- "when I work on something and i talk about something or watch something while i work on a i will forever associate the thing with whatever i did on the side"

## Potential Interview Topics
