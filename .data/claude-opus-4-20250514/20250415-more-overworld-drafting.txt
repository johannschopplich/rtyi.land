## Game Development Process
- Currently in advanced stages with all 15 main levels completed in first draft form
- Major focus on overworld design and implementing approximately 20 secret stars
- Planning for 180-200 total stars in the game (currently at 177 planned)
- Parallel development approach: "the beta testing will happen in parallel with all the reworks and the sound engine stuff"
- Remaining tasks: "what else is left for the game before it releases? Just the overworld? The overworld is one part. I do want to refactor the sound engine entirely... I want to refactor the operating system... I want to get beta tests of every level in the game... Then we still have to wait for Biobak to finish a lot of the level reworks. And we need to do the side levels. And I need to do a big round of bug fixes"
- Course 3 and Course 11 have been beta tested and are mostly finalized

## Personal Insights
- Frustrated with Mario 64's original code quality: "The past week I've been super busy fixing up Mario 64's audio engine The more I read it the more I realize this whole thing is fucked"
- Design philosophy emphasizes restraint: "It is tempting to look at the game you're making and to be like Let's throw in every cool mechanic that I know of But I don't think that gets you a good game"
- Commitment to performance: "the objective is constant 30 FPS on real and 64"
- Acknowledges potential legal risks but remains confident: "I've been doing this for 12 years. In a Season Assist, what will you do? I will remove Mario from the game. And the Goombas. And the Yoshis. And I will make them my own characters. And then instead of a romhack, I will release a video game"
- Values making the overworld feel alive: "Makes the overworld feel very alive" (referring to dynamic events)

## Collaborator Information
- Badoob: Composer creating the overworld soundtrack - "if you don't know Badoob is the person composing the OST and he has made I think almost 20 songs for the overworld and They're all gonna transition into each other"
- Biobak: Graphics artist responsible for level reworks - "we still have to wait for Biobak to finish a lot of the level reworks"
- Zeina: Working on animations, specifically mentioned working on Course 13 - "there is one area in Course 13 missing because Zeyna wanted to work on it. And she has been putting a lot of detail on there"
- Other Contributors: 
  - Okayo: Video editor - "And now that I have an editor and sponsors, it's a lot easier"
  - Beta testers: Multiple unnamed testers involved in level testing
  - Death Wizard: Mentioned in context of documenting audio bugs

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Implementing seamless music transitions: "So the music here is just gonna fade into each other when you go to a new area it's gonna be super cool and smooth"
- Audio engine refactoring due to code issues: "there was a float multiplication with a value close to one on every single node in the entire game every single audio tick which of course is very expensive to compute and Does nothing"
- Creating permanent overworld changes after events: "We want this to have a permanent effect on the overworld, so remember that the event happened"
- Elder Yoshi fight design as tutorial/hint system: "He tells you secret stars or hidden levels in the overworld you've missed. He will only share his knowledge with this guild. So you have to beat him up first"
- Avoiding item-carrying missions: "it's always tempting to make Mario carry an item around to make a mission work, because it's so easy to make missions work with that. But the truth is that carrying items just isn't fun"

## Business Aspects
- Videos as primary revenue source: "Personally, I don't like having to make videos. But it is the only way I can make any profit out of this. And pay the people that help me"
- Sponsorship arrangements: "And now that I have an editor and sponsors, it's a lot easier"
- Squarespace sponsorship mentioned: "You guys might be in luck because there's a chance I will upload again next Sunday because of Squarespace the Squarespace finally opened my link"
- Contingency plan for potential Nintendo action: "They cannot ban me from making a video game. But can they really take down YouTube videos?"

## Key Quotes
- "The more I read it the more I realize this whole thing is fucked And I need to improve it, and I'm working on improving it, and it's slowly getting better"
- "It is tempting to look at the game you're making and to be like Let's throw in every cool mechanic that I know of But I don't think that gets you a good game"
- "This is also all going to be one open world with no loading zones. Well, there are going to be loading zones but no visible loading zones. I think it's going to be extremely cool"
