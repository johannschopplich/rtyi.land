## Game Development Process
- Project has been in development for "almost three years" and is approximately "70 percent" complete
- Engine upgrades are "mostly done" with ongoing refinements
- Also working on a Banjo-Kazooie hack that is "almost finished"
- Development follows typical pattern: "when you make games it always starts like really fun and eventually it turns into pure torture that's just the cycle of making games"
- Less than 4% of major ROM hack projects get finished according to Kaze's observation
- Uses Mario 64 decompilation as the base for the project

## Personal Insights
- Acknowledges the difficulty of game development: "that's the thing when you make games it always starts like really fun and eventually it turns into pure torture"
- Emphasizes importance of scope: "that's why i always tell people to start with a small project otherwise they are just going to not get anything done at all"
- Shows consideration for player experience: "with the romhack you have the disadvantage that no one paid for your game. So there's no initial commitment from the player"
- Values clean code: "I don't want my code to be disgusting" when refactoring
- Takes pride in optimization work: mentions multiple optimizations to sine/cosine functions and memory management
- Protective of project vision: "No, I'm not just gonna offload my work to someone else. That is cringe"

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: No relevant information found in this transcript
- Biobak: Graphics artist who has done significant visual improvements
  - "I did most of it. And Biobank did a lot of revamping to make this look prettier"
  - Actively involved in texture work and visual design decisions
  - Kaze delegates billboard texture work to them: "Biobank will end up doing this"
- Zeina: Animator working on character animations
  - Sent video showing animation work with rotation issues
  - Working on making characters rotate properly around their center point
  - Discussion about technical details of root positioning in animations
- Other Contributors:
  - Yoshi Milkman: Community member offering to help with Mario model improvements
  - Various active community members providing feedback during stream

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Implementing tutorial bunnies to teach movement mechanics (dive jump, wall kick/slide, spin jump)
- Camera philosophy: "if you make the camera rotate without the player being able to predict it, you're always gonna have to play a whole direction that they don't intend"
- Player patience management: "the players they start out with some amount of patience left for your game... for a romhack, you can't really go over your patience budget"
- Visual improvements: increased shading, new wood textures for windmill, shadow additions
- Tutorial design using rings that players must pass through using specific moves
- Technical limitations: "the N64 on 64x64 images can only have 16 colors. And transparency"
- Performance optimization: "This level here runs almost 60 FPS on N64, so we can add whatever we want to it"

## Business Aspects
- Plans for open source release: "It will be open source once it releases"
- Legal concerns: "this is kind of technically illegal for me to do" but notes Nintendo "haven't sent a C&D over this game"
- Previous content takedowns: "I have had tutorials before but nintendo always takes them down"
- Considering platform change from Twitch to YouTube due to advertising issues
- No monetization through ads: "YouTube's telling me this would be a good time to put an ad. I'm not putting one"

## Key Quotes
- "I've been programming this for almost three years now but we are getting close to finish well i mean like 70 percent maybe"
- "You have to be very careful with the text you put. Because the players they start out with some amount of patience left for your game. And depending on how much they were looking forward to your game, that amount of patience is higher. But for a romhack, you can't really go over your patience budget."
- "when you make games it always starts like really fun and eventually it turns into pure torture that's just the cycle of making games"

## Potential Interview Topics
1. The three-year development journey: What were the major milestones and how did the project evolve from initial concept to 70% completion?
2. Team collaboration process: How did Kaze assemble the team (Biobak, Zeina, Badub) and what is the workflow for integrating their contributions?
3. Design philosophy for ROM hacks: How does designing for a ROM hack differ from original game development, particularly regarding player patience and expectations?
4. Technical innovations and optimizations: What specific engine improvements have been made to the Mario 64 base, and what technical challenges were most significant?
5. Community involvement and feedback: How has the streaming process and community interaction influenced development decisions?
