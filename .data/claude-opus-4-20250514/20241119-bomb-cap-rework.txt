## Game Development Process
- Currently working on texture implementation and visual polish for factory-related elements
- Implementing bomb cap power-up system with specific spawn conditions
- Demo is "basically done" but release is dependent on video production schedule
- Planned demo release potentially December 28th, after several videos including one about "the missing link" on December 14th
- Actively optimizing code and fixing visual bugs during stream
- Working on stage modifications where "bokwang doesn't spawn if you've already got the cap"

## Personal Insights
- "I have literally infinite ego" - shows confidence in his abilities
- "I don't go outside. What do I need a phone for?" - reflects on his lifestyle and dedication to development
- Expresses frustration with music choices: "This just sounds like someone hitting random keys on Xylophone. This is not good music."
- Shows perfectionist tendencies: "I can change it to 1, but I don't want to lose the effect"
- Humorous consideration of sponsorship: "Shaving my balls live on video for $2,000"
- On being called dumb: "I don't think I've ever been like called dumb in the last 15 years or so and like actually taken it personally"

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: No relevant information found in this transcript
- Biobak: Working on textures for the game, specifically mentioned "there's textures missing in the factorycanon.blend file." Kaze communicates with them about texture issues and updates during stream
- Zeina: No relevant information found in this transcript
- Other Contributors: Holly and Lila are mentioned as community members/viewers but not as direct contributors to the game development

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Implementing King Bob-omb to not spawn if bomb cap is already unlocked: "the idea is that he doesn't spawn if you have the bomb cap unlocked, and he dies permanently"
- Stage design philosophy: "You have to beat the stage once forwards and once backwards and I did beat it backwards earlier and I think it's really fun"
- Working on visual effects: Modified King Bob-omb to turn orange when exploding and die in one hit
- Texture and lighting optimization using "primitive color" and "shade color" multiplication for dynamic room lighting
- Adding quality of life improvements: "I wanna make a change to the stage that bokwang doesn't spawn if you've already got the cap"

## Business Aspects
- Received Manscaped sponsorship opportunity for $2,000: "bio bag 8 manscaped sponsorship opportunity I can give you bald shaving heads in 4k on YouTube"
- Working toward Twitter monetization: "we're so close to Twitter monetization. I just need to respond to like two or three more tweets"
- Demo release tied to video production schedule: "The new demo will be released whenever the video for it is ready"
- Content strategy consideration: "the amount of people watching it is going to be so much lower than the amount of people playing the game"

## Key Quotes
- "I'm basically done with it, but there is one video I'm going to release like Saturday. There's another video my editor has yet to start on."
- "I think it's really fun to beat this stage backwards as well because like all the obstacles may kind of work for you that way and it changes the vibe a lot."
- "I am optimizing a 28 year old video game right now online for you."

## Potential Interview Topics
- The creative process behind the bomb cap power-up system and how it integrates with existing Mario 64 mechanics
- Remote collaboration challenges and solutions when working with artists like Biobak on texture implementation
- The decision to design stages that can be played both forwards and backwards, and how this affects level design philosophy
- Balancing perfectionism with practical development timelines and community expectations
- The role of live streaming in the development process and how community feedback influences design decisions
