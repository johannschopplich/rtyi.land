## Game Development Process
- The game will have 15 courses in total
- Ongoing optimization work: "I applied your idea in the entire game it saved like 30 instructions or so"
- Currently working on creating a styrofoam material/texture system for the N64
- Development involves extensive experimentation and iteration to achieve desired visual results within hardware constraints

## Personal Insights
- Strong preference for focused development work: "You know what my least favorite thing about streaming is people asking me stuff that doesn't [relate] to what I'm doing right now. I really don't want to talk about things. I want to just talk about making my game. That's all I want"
- "I find it very exhausting to have to engage in social stuff when I just want to work"
- Shows dedication to quality: "I want it to look as close to real styrofoam as I can"
- Acknowledges learning from others: "This is something Daryl made first. I can't take credit for this"

  - X-links: Assisting with texture creation and sending texture samples
  - Danik: Sent resources via Discord
  - Daryl: Original developer of a normal mapping technique that Kaze is adapting for multiple directions

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Major challenge: Creating realistic styrofoam material within N64 hardware limitations
- Solution: Implementing a normal map system with pre-computed lighting for 6-8 fixed rotations
- Technical constraint: "The N64 also can't do normal maps. We have to compute the output of the normal map before we pass this to the renderer on the CPU"
- Design decision to limit styrofoam objects to specific rotations to enable the effect
- Attention to material variety: "Would be another interesting material to [add] after this course"

## Key Quotes
- "I really just want to hack the game. I find it very exhausting to have to engage in social stuff when I just want to work."
- "There's going to be 15 courses in total"
- "We're going to limit ourselves to six rotations. Or maybe eight... It's definitely cheaper than the Shy Guy Google sales."

## Potential Interview Topics
- The challenge of implementing modern visual techniques (like normal mapping) on retro hardware and the creative solutions required
- The role of community members in providing technical solutions and how collaboration works in ROM hack development
- Balancing community engagement through streaming with the need for focused development time
- The importance of visual polish and material variety in elevating a ROM hack beyond typical fan projects
- How techniques and ideas from other developers in the ROM hacking community are shared, adapted, and improved upon
