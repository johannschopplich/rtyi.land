## Game Development Process
- Major performance breakthrough: "We found like a 10-15% performance improvement. At this stage, that is crazy. I don't think we will ever see another performance improvement this big."
- Currently working on Course 11 (power plant level) out of at least 15 courses
- Implemented new rendering system for coins, converting them from billboards to sprites for better performance
- Most levels now running at or near 60 FPS: "This whole level is generally mostly just 60 FPS now"
- Using iterative design process with live testing during streams

## Personal Insights
- On release timeline: "Guys, this releases when it gets done. Like, literally just leave me alone. It's done when it's done. That's all you're gonna get."
- Balancing development with life: "No, I have a full time job. I can't spend that much time working on this right now. Unfortunately."
- On game difficulty philosophy: "How difficult are you looking for it? About vanilla Mario 64. Although, keep in mind, the controls in this work a lot better. So a lot of stuff can be looking more difficult, while actually being easier."
- Financial mindset: "I've always lived like a poor person... I have literally not been spending a single cent on stuff that is not worth more money in the future."
- Recently moved to a new house: "I am in a house now. It's not mine yet. We are entirely enslaved to the bank."

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: No specific mentions in this transcript
- Biobak: Actively involved in texture work for the power plant level, providing real-time feedback during stream about platform designs and gameplay mechanics
- Zeina: Mentioned as Kaze's partner who has "banished" him to the basement for his workspace
- Other Contributors:
  - Mata: Commissioned to rework the bomb factory level, significantly overdue (4 months past 2-week estimate)
  - Yoshi Milkman: Creating custom sound effects for the game, including different sounds for metal and grates
  - Dumpy: Stream viewer who composed music for "Super Mario Clips," potentially interested in contributing
  - Stream viewers: Provide real-time feedback and suggestions during development

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Implemented weight-based platform mechanics that work like scales: "Standing on one moves the other one up"
- Designed multi-room power plant level with progressive difficulty and mechanic introduction
- Struggling with visual design for factory/industrial areas: "Factories are definitely not my strength. The bomb factory looks really bad, I think."
- Platform types for Course 11: "treadmills, dangling platforms, collapsing grates"
- Added humorous element with Bowser's minions getting union benefits after a strike
- Technical challenge of making platforms animate properly while maintaining performance

## Business Aspects
- Development limited by full-time job: "I have a full time job, I can't dedicate that much time to just working on this"
- No firm release date: "At least mid next year" but refuses to guarantee
- Commissioned work model: Paid Mata for factory rework despite delays
- Recent house purchase affecting finances: "Instant poor when buying a house"
- Community engagement through regular streaming sessions

## Key Quotes
- "I think this is the bird level. No, the bird looks great. You're wrong if you think this is ugly. This is awesome."
- "The idea is that at some point you stop learning what the game is. You start learning how human to human combat works, how like different concepts like a neutral game, increasing the amount of options you have, learning what the Nash equilibrium is, stuff like that."
- "Dude, since the last stream I made so many updates to this game. Oh, you guys have no idea."

## Potential Interview Topics
- The technical breakthrough with sprite rendering and how it changed the game's performance ceiling
- Balancing passion project development with full-time employment and life changes
- The collaborative process with remote artists and managing expectations/deadlines
- Design philosophy for difficulty curves and how improved controls affect level design
- The role of community feedback through streaming in shaping the game's development
