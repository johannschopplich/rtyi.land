## Game Development Process
- Currently working on course 11 (ice castle) and course 13, with the oil level recently completed
- "We're in quest 13 out of 15, so we're almost done already. Well, almost done. It's probably still going to be like two years or so, I don't know."
- Estimated 175-180 stars total, with potential expansion: "I keep having new ideas for how to pad the playtime at the end"
- Game structure includes 130 main stars plus various bonus content
- Development includes real-time testing on actual N64 hardware: "let me just upload my ROM egg to the N64 real quick, which I can do with a button first now"

## Personal Insights
- Expecting a daughter named Reyna in 4 weeks: "my daughter will be born in four weeks, that's true, in four weeks I will have a child"
- Reyna is named after a childhood friend who passed away: "the name behind Reyna is that she's named after a friend of mine that passed away when I was 12 years old"
- Concerns about his child's perception of gaming: "I just hope that our daughter is not going to be one of those popular kids that thinks gamers are losers"
- Frustration with video editing: "I have a whole block with video ideas that I could make and I think there's at least like 20 ideas that would be 100,000 views if I was just not so fucking spiteful of video editing"
- Wariness of Nintendo: "If Nintendo ever sent me like a job offer or something or invited me to like present the game in Japan I would think it's a ploy to like get me arrested"

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: No relevant information found in this transcript
- Biobak: Graphics artist working on visual elements - "biobank didn't do this one yet I just kind of tried to do it in the style that biobank was making the stuff"; credited with idea for moving dots on platforms: "And you see how the dots move depending on how the platform moves that was biobank's idea"
- Zeina: Kaze's partner, mentioned briefly joining the stream call; involved in testing game elements
- Other Contributors: 
  - Dan: Helped with lighting effects - "Dan even helped me look into this a little bit to get a proper effect going"
  - Salvato: Game designer consulted about dive mechanics
  - Unnamed video editor: Offered to edit videos for $16 per minute

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Debate about dive mechanics: "the dive is kind of antithetical to the rest of Mario 64" - considering limiting angle changes during dives
- Implementing accessibility options: "We have an easy sightseeing mode where there's just no hp at all"
- Star mission variety including Yoshi missions inspired by Mario Galaxy comets and Sonic Adventure emerald hunts
- Philosophy of "pick your own difficulty where you can go for risky jumps and like do the difficult thing or you can do the easy thing whenever you want"
- Technical innovations: "I invented the spline light... You see how there's light coming from the spline here"
- Freezing mechanics implementation for ice-themed enemies

## Business Aspects
- Considering hiring video editor: "There was someone offering to make video editing for me He won $16 per minute of edited video. I'm probably taking that deal"
- History with Nintendo: "They usually don't have an issue 70 of my videos say otherwise" (regarding video takedowns)
- No specific release or distribution plans mentioned
- YouTube content creation bottlenecked by editing: "my youtube output is so hard bottlenecked by my unwillingness to make videos"

## Key Quotes
- "I want the game to not be difficult I want it to be like pick your own difficulty where you can go for risky jumps and like do the difficult thing or you can do the easy thing whenever you want"
- "every content star in this game is like 3 times the size of a Mario 64 star if you think about it. So really, in Mario 64 terms, this is a 400 star hack"
- "Having a daughter, I think is going to be scary, because there's so many predators out there"
