## Game Development Process
- Kaze spent "the last two weeks working on this level here importing biobak's things" - indicating active asset integration phase
- Made significant gameplay change: "I made it so that red coin stars don't put you out of the stage anymore, I think that was a necessary change"
- Currently working on a cowboy-themed level featuring minecart chase mechanics with Shy Guys
- Live iteration and testing of gameplay mechanics during development streams
- Using Mario 64 decompilation as the base for development

## Personal Insights
- On game design philosophy: "I think it'd be nice to have a Mario game where stuff like that doesn't boot you out at all. But that is a very limiting design thing, because that means we can't have linear section that end in something without having like a weird warp back"
- On content creation: "Making level previews on YouTube is just not a good business model. I have to make technical videos, unfortunately"
- Strong opinions on game controls: Comparing games without proper analog controls to "serving a soup full of piss to people that just have never had good food in their life"
- Values fair gameplay: Regarding potential player deaths - "No, that's an unfair death. We don't want that"

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: No relevant information found in this transcript
- Biobak: Graphics artist whose assets Kaze spent two weeks importing into the current level

- Other Contributors:
  - Mr. Comet: Referenced as someone whose work on Mario Party is being honored through this project ("this whole thing is a homage to your work")

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Removed stage exit after collecting red coin stars to improve player experience
- Iterating on minecart chase sequence: tried multiple configurations (three small carts vs. one large cart)
- Implementing cutscene to prevent unfair player deaths: "the only solution here is a cutscene"
- Camera control challenges: "One thing I really don't like about this is that the door is letting the camera through. I feel like doors should never let the camera through"
- Sound design changes: Replaced ground pound jump sound with Mario Kart 64 sound, added new spin jump and falling sounds from Melee

## Business Aspects
- PayPal payment issues: "I'm getting PayPal cocked they refused to let me use my PayPal money... I can use it I just can't send it to anyone"
- Exploring Twitter monetization: "if I could monetize my Twitter account, that'd be like $200 a month" but needs "five million impressions"
- Considering hiring social media manager: "I'm thinking I should hire a social media manager" with revenue sharing model
- Strategic content creation: Acknowledges need to make technical videos over gameplay previews for better business results

## Key Quotes
- "I feel like if you're a really good looking guy, you might be able to be a romance scammer" - Kaze's humor while discussing PayPal issues
- "Many people even game developers do not know of this trick but it is something that you can use to make your game feel a lot better" - On analog stick controls
- "Isn't the point of the human experience to have creative expression isn't that what makes us unique" - Philosophical reflection during development
