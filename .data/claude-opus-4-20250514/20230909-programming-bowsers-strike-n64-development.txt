## Game Development Process
- Game is reported to be 75% complete
- Currently working on Bowser's office level with elevator mechanics and office aesthetics
- Cloud ocean level received major visual improvements to appear "near infinite" rather than confined
- Options menu has been implemented with settings for interlacing and FPS limiting
- Planning to release around September as "that's the time where it's like least likely Nintendo's gonna take them down"
- Next major milestone is boss fight implementation: "And then next time we are finally ready to make the boss fight, I think"

## Personal Insights
- Shows strong enthusiasm for creative level design: "I'm actually so much looking forward to the next level that we have planned... The Wild West Valley"
- Philosophical about AI's impact on creativity: "The question is the skills that AI lets you skip learning are those even valuable anymore if AI can do them for you?"
- Aware of legal constraints: "I'm not gonna make a physical cartridge because if I do I will get sued to shit"
- Values performance optimization: "turn interlacing off it's not pleasant... this increases frame rate by like 25%"
- Self-aware about content creation struggles: "YouTube is just not profitable for me because my channel is not that big or interesting"
- Takes pride in overcoming technical challenges: "I can literally just make up shit and it will work. I am fucking insane."

## Collaborator Information

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Bowser's office features bureaucratic humor: "the shy guy says, oh you're trying to visit Bowser go into the Waiting seats and wait forever because he doesn't take appointments"
- Strike/union mission narrative: "All the minions gather around Bowser's plaza and they're on a strike... And then as soon as you walk out the big big oil monster comes and it just eats you"
- Wild West Valley planned features: "There's gonna be cowboys, you're gonna be catching like villains that are running around. There's gonna be wanted posters"
- Technical challenges with collision detection: "Mario 64 can only do cylinders. Try to approximate this guy with a cylinder"
- Visual improvements prioritized: Cloud ocean changed from "around this size of Bob-omb battlefield" to appearing "near infinite"
- Interactive dialogue system that changes based on player actions: "whenever you destroy something, the dialogue is no longer available. So it gives you a hint as to what to do next"

## Business Aspects
- Strategic release timing: Plans September release to minimize Nintendo takedown risk
- Merchandise strategy: "I might make a box and an instruction booklet and all that and I'm probably gonna sell those as merch and then you can get the cartridge somewhere else not from me"
- YouTube monetization efforts: Investing $5 per YouTube short, values subscribers at "around 5 cents" each
- Content planning through December with technical videos like "cryptic stars in Mario 64" and "baking shadows into N64 games"
- Acknowledges current unprofitability: "YouTube is just not profitable for me because my channel is not that big or interesting"
- Aware of industry salary limitations: "I also work in the game industry where you make less money than anywhere else. Programming wise."

## Key Quotes
- "This game has a lot more text than Mario 64. Well, it also has a lot more content and playtime. So it makes sense."
- "I think people have an innate desire to be good or useful at something. And you just lose that [with AI]."
- "Dude, this is going to be such a fun mission to speedrun. Holy shit."
