## Game Development Process
- Game is in final stretch with 15 courses completed, currently working on overworld connections and remaining side levels
- Working specifically on Part 2 of overworld as bridge between Part 1 and Part 3
- Completion timeline is flexible: "Even after this game is technically complete, there is still going to be more that I want to do to it. It being content complete does not mean that I will instantly release it"
- Beta testing phase active with dedicated Discord server for testers
- Release timing depends on finding appropriate moment to avoid immediate Nintendo action

## Personal Insights
- Views game design education skeptically: "I think studying game design is relatively pointless, because game design is such a new art that basically all the research that's been done on it so far amounts to basically nothing"
- Prioritizes player freedom over restrictive design: "I'm not a fan of trying to prevent cheese that much. If you can get there, it should just work"
- Ambivalent about Nintendo legal action, seeing potential opportunity: "I'm half hoping Nintendo shuts me down. So I have to exchange all the assets for non-Nintendo assets. So I can actually sell it"
- Demonstrates dedication by working while severely ill, showing commitment to maintaining development momentum

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: No specific information found in this transcript
- Biobak: Mentioned as graphics contributor, involved in beta testing community
- Zeina: Animator who also provides personal support (made soup and tea during Kaze's illness), described as getting over similar illness in 3 days
- Other Contributors: 
  - Aesir: Commission artist Kaze refers work to, potential partner in planned commission store
  - Trumpets solo: Contributor to actor reworks, mentioned as becoming "famous" through project exposure
  - Wiseguy: Created PC port technology that could facilitate porting this game

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Major overworld progression challenge: connecting areas after first Bowser defeat while maintaining thematic consistency
- Rejected bridge repair mechanic due to thematic inconsistency: "Yoshis aren't really known for repairing bridges... you just saved him and now he wants money from you"
- Implemented Dory solution: chained character freed by Yoshis, enables flutter jump progression to next area
- Removed invisible walls from engine: "My engine actually doesn't have invisible walls anymore. Unless there's legitimately no level boundary"
- Balancing camera control with cinematic presentation: wants player freedom while ensuring scenes "look cool"
- Established coin-based overworld interactions to create precedent for currency use in exploration

## Business Aspects
- Secured Squarespace sponsorship requiring 6 videos in 3 months, plans to feature actor rework content
- Cannot monetize game directly due to Nintendo IP: "You will be able to just download this game for free. I can't charge for this because it's not my IP"
- Developing commission store concept with Aesir to monetize modeling skills
- Has active Patreon for general support
- Considering original IP conversion as both backup plan and potential business opportunity
- Strategic release timing planned to minimize immediate legal action

## Key Quotes
- "I'm half hoping Nintendo shuts me down. So I have to exchange all the assets for non-Nintendo assets. So I can actually sell it."
- "I think studying game design is relatively pointless, because game design is such a new art that basically all the research that's been done on it so far amounts to basically nothing."
- "Camera framing is difficult, because I don't want to take away camera control from the player. I want the player to have full freedom. But also I want the scenes to look cool."

## Potential Interview Topics
- The evolution of overworld design philosophy and how player agency influenced level progression mechanics
- Collaboration dynamics and how personal relationships (like with Zeina) intersect with professional development work
- The strategic considerations around Nintendo IP usage and the calculated risk of potential legal action
- The technical innovations in collision detection and engine modifications that differentiate this from standard Mario 64 hacks
- The business model challenges of fan game development and monetization strategies within legal constraints
