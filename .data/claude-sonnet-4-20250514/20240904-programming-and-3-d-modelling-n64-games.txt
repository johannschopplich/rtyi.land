## Game Development Process
- The game is in active development with Kaze working on Course 3 (an ice/snow themed level) featuring mirror mechanics and room-based design
- Performance optimization is a major focus, currently achieving 23-45 FPS with a target of 60 FPS on N64 hardware
- The team has transitioned from X2 to X3 microcode for better RSP (Reality Signal Processor) performance, with Soren leading this technical advancement
- A demo release is planned featuring "Chris 1, only the first level"
- Release strategy involves multiple versions: v1.0 (emulator + N64 support), v1.1 (bug fixes), then potentially N64-exclusive versions for maximum optimization

## Personal Insights
- Kaze expresses increased motivation to work harder due to having a child and needing more income: "I want to work like a lot harder than I already work. Because I have a child now and I need more money"
- He maintains strong technical opinions, particularly about programming languages: "if you care at all, like even just a little bit about which programming language you use, that is a very strong indicator that you're a terrible programmer"
- Demonstrates deep technical knowledge and passion for optimization, particularly around N64 hardware limitations and performance
- Shows pragmatic approach to development challenges and willingness to rebuild systems for better performance

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: No relevant information found in this transcript
- Biobak: Referenced as the graphics artist who will receive completed work ("it's not insulting to Biobank when I pass this over"), suggesting ongoing collaboration on visual assets
- Zeina: No relevant information found in this transcript
- Other Contributors: Soren (leading X3 microcode optimization work), WiseGuy (working on static recompilation project), Fast64 development team (providing export tools)

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Implementation of a sophisticated mirror system with axis-based parameters for easier level design integration
- Room-based level architecture designed to guarantee 60 FPS performance by limiting rendering scope
- Ongoing lighting system issues when multiple light sources appear, causing ambient lighting to reset to zero
- Collision system optimization challenges due to large triangle meshes requiring extensive pool nodes
- Strategic door mechanics that become solid when players are distant to prevent camera clipping issues

## Business Aspects
- Cannot release the game directly due to Nintendo copyright concerns: "I can't physically release this game, Christian. Because if I do, I will get giga sued by Nintendo"
- Plans to distribute as a patch containing only original changes that can be applied to existing N64 ROMs
- Acknowledges unauthorized sales of his games on platforms like Etsy but doesn't officially encourage this
- Considers emulator support limitations for future versions to maximize N64 hardware performance

## Key Quotes
- "I can't physically release this game, Christian. Because if I do, I will get giga sued by Nintendo."
- "I want to work like a lot harder than I already work. Because I have a child now and I need more money."
- "if you care at all, like even just a little bit about which programming language you use, that is a very strong indicator that you're a terrible programmer"
