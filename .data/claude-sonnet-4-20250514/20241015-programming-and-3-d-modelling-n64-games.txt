## Game Development Process
- The project is currently working on Course 14, a paper-themed level with multiple biomes and complex mechanics
- Course 1 has been completed after extensive analysis and reworking: "Either way today actually we're done with course one"
- Only one course remains after the current one: "After this, yes, after this, there's only one course left. That is correct."
- The game is built on the Mario 64 decompilation, allowing for modern development techniques while maintaining N64 compatibility
- Development involves iterative design with community feedback and multiple revisions of levels
- Performance optimization is an ongoing concern, especially for complex levels with many visual effects

## Personal Insights
- Kaze describes himself as "7 out of 10" as both programmer and designer, showing self-awareness about his limitations
- He demonstrates perfectionist tendencies, spending significant time on details like bridge textures and paper airplane authenticity
- Level design philosophy centers on player experience: "I would say the purpose of almost all the levels is just to let you experience freedom and immersion at this point after the first one, which has to also teach you movement"
- Shows strong opinions about game industry practices, particularly criticizing Game Freak's management and unused potential in their games
- Values community collaboration: "It's not just my game, you are helping a lot on it"

## Collaborator Information
- **Badoop (Composer)**: Created multiple new songs for Course 14 that dynamically change based on player location; uploads work to SoundCloud quickly; appears to be highly productive with musical content
- **Biobank (Graphics Artist)**: Performs level reworks that somehow improve performance while adding content; has created custom fonts for the project; contributes to visual optimization
- **Zeina (Animator)**: Created textures and animations, including the new grind animation for Mario's movement
- **Other Contributors**: Lera/Lila works on 3D models and textures; various community members provide real-time feedback and suggestions during streams

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Redesigning bridge textures to better fit the paper-themed world aesthetic, showing attention to visual cohesion
- Implementing wing cap mechanics to provide players with freedom of movement while maintaining level progression structure
- Balancing performance optimization with visual complexity in levels with many transparent effects and detailed models
- Creating authentic paper airplane models using mathematical precision rather than estimation
- Designing target/bubble blower mechanics that feel natural within the paper craft theme
- Managing camera systems for different gameplay modes (ground vs. flying)

## Business Aspects
- No serious discussion of funding, marketing, or commercial release plans
- Mentions potential content creation around the project: "I'm still thinking of making the Mr. Least video. I hacked every N64 game in one day"
- Jokes about Nintendo's potential reaction: "Nintendo should be scared I attack headquarters"
- Project appears to be passion-driven rather than commercially motivated

## Key Quotes
- "I would say the purpose of almost all the levels is just to let you experience freedom and immersion at this point after the first one, which has to also teach you movement"
- "It's not just my game, you are helping a lot on it"
- "there's also still the biobank rework for this level, which somehow every time biobank reworks the levels, he improves the performance despite adding a shit ton of stuff"

## Potential Interview Topics
