## Game Development Process
- Currently working on course 13, with Space Arcade and Papercraft levels planned as the final two courses (14 and 15)
- Actively debugging crashes related to coin formations and collision triangles that are causing memory issues
- Completed basic UV-mapping work off-stream and is now focusing on improving texture quality
- Planning and implementing retro game sections, specifically working on a Mario Land 1 level with rail shooter mechanics
- Creating 3D models for classic 2D sprites (planes, enemies) to work within the Mario 64 engine
- Target performance is 60 FPS with optimization work ongoing

## Personal Insights
- "I have officially lost my mind. I am actually working. On my major hack" - shows his surprise at his own productivity
- About his work schedule: "I got three whole months of it long for having a child. But also, I need to work more because I want to make more money. So that's why I'm gonna just stream like basically every day now"
- On his streaming efficiency: "I'm very efficient working on stream" - indicating he finds public development motivating
- Shows strong nostalgia-driven design philosophy: "for me, Land 1 is like the only one that I will have some nostalgia for"
- Expresses frustration with technical limitations: "every emulator is broken as fuck" but pragmatically chooses the most usable option

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: No relevant information found
- Biobak: No relevant information found  
- Zeina: No relevant information found
- Other Contributors: Lila/Leela appears to be involved in development tools and UI work, helping with upgrader functionality and repository settings

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Strict rule that only games released before Mario 64 are eligible for retro sections to maintain temporal authenticity
- Choosing Project64 emulator over alternatives due to usability despite known bugs: "I just have to pick one emulator and run with it"
- Converting 2D Mario Land levels into 3D using forced perspective camera and rail shooter mechanics
- Memory optimization challenges requiring removal of collision triangles and careful asset management
- Balancing retro authenticity with technical constraints of the N64 engine

## Business Aspects
- Increased streaming frequency motivated by upcoming child and need for additional income
- Mentions potential promotional opportunity with "mystery box gifted from some weeb gift shop thing"
- Game distribution will require Project64 with GlideN64 plugin for proper functionality
- No specific monetization or funding strategies discussed beyond streaming revenue

## Key Quotes
- "I have officially lost my mind. I am actually working. On my major hack."
- "I got three whole months of it long for having a child. But also, I need to work more because I want to make more money. So that's why I'm gonna just stream like basically every day now."
- "every emulator is broken as fuck. It's just that I've been using this emulator because this one is the easiest one to use."
