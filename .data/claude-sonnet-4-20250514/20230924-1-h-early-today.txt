## Game Development Process
- Currently working on boss implementation for a level featuring an oil-based enemy that can phase through platforms
- Experiencing technical optimization challenges, particularly with FPS issues (animations dropping from 60 to 30 FPS)
- Collaborating with team member Silas on code optimization, testing new versions of animation systems
- Development appears to be in active implementation phase with real-time problem-solving and iteration
- Using live streaming as part of the development process, incorporating community feedback in real-time

## Personal Insights
- Kaze has experienced a significant realization about ROM hack design: "there's a problem with playing ROM-Mix. And that is that the player's expectation is that they can easily 100% the game" which limits design space for challenging or hidden content
- Expresses personal growth: "recently I feel like I have been evolving. I'm just getting so much better at everything for some reason"
- Design philosophy: "what people feel, in a way, is real. You can't change that fact. But their reasoning is most of the time stupid" - showing his approach to balancing player feedback with creative vision
- Strong opposition to equipment-gating: "I don't want the player to equip for a level. I never want the player to be in a level and then feel like, oh, I should leave this level and come back with a different set of equipment"

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: No specific information mentioned in this transcript
- Biobak: Referenced as a graphics artist, appears active in chat providing feedback and suggestions during development
- Zeina: No specific information mentioned in this transcript  
- Other Contributors: 
  - Silas: Code collaborator providing optimization work, specifically mentioned for animation system improvements
  - Lila/Leila: Close collaborator present during stream, provides design input and feedback on camera work and boss mechanics
  - Active community members providing real-time feedback through chat

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Camera system design for boss fights, balancing visibility of platforms vs. the boss character
- Arena design philosophy: making spaces feel larger through perceived space rather than actual size
- Addressing player expectation management around 100% completion vs. optional challenging content
- Technical animation challenges with vertex displacement and frame rate optimization
- Consideration of badge/perk systems but resistance to over-complicating the Mario 64 formula
- Oil-based boss mechanics allowing phase-through of platforms while maintaining challenging gameplay

## Business Aspects

## Key Quotes
- "I actually had a pretty big revelation today. And that is, that there's a problem with playing ROM-Mix. And that is that the player's expectation is that they can easily 100% the game... We can't put hard challenges without people complaining. We can't put super secret hidden stuff without people complaining. And I think that really takes away a lot of design space."
- "my philosophy is, what people feel, in a way, is real. You can't change that fact. But their reasoning is most of the time stupid. You should just ignore people's reasoning. But you can never really ignore people's feeling."
- "I don't want the player to equip for a level. I never want the player to be in a level and then feel like, oh, I should leave this level and come back with a different set of equipment. I feel like that's a really bad thought to have in your mind."

## Potential Interview Topics
