## Game Development Process
- The game is nearing completion with 15 main courses planned: "We are getting 15 courses" and "game is nearly finished. We are getting there"
- Currently working on course 15 (the final course), described as a "space arcade" level
- After course 15, still need to complete "the Overworld and the Bowser level and some side level. So after this, there's three side levels missing if you include the Bowser one"
- Course 15 is expected to develop faster than previous levels because "there's not much character interactions. And usually the part that takes the longest to develop is the character interactions"
- The development involves significant technical work including collision mapping, physics improvements, and debugging complex systems

## Personal Insights
- Kaze demonstrates strong opinions about game design, particularly regarding retro elements: "I don't want them to like bleed into the rest of the game" when discussing how Mario 64 references should be contained within warp pipes
- Shows pride in the technical achievements: "the physics do feel infinitely better. Everything you do just works"
- Expresses frustration with technical challenges but maintains determination to solve them
- Believes RTYI will have significant impact on the ROM hacking community: "RTYI is definitely going to be the rumming where people are like, this is the reason I even get into rummings"
- Values both innovation and accessibility in game design decisions

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub**: No relevant information found in this transcript
- **Biobak**: Major graphics artist and 3D modeler, extensively involved in level design and visual improvements. Referenced throughout as working on lighting, textures, collision maps, and level geometry. Also appears to go by "Spiralback" based on context
- **Zeina**: Mentioned as handling animations but limited discussion in this stream
- **Other Contributors**: Arthur Tilley (contributed the idea for the warp pipe leading to Mario 64 level sections)

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Final level designed as a "space arcade" featuring a large rocket in the center with spiral platforming inside
- Six star missions planned including various arcade games: whack-a-mole, rhythm games, skidball, and pinball mechanics
- Mario 64 retro section accessible via warp pipe featuring "very short sections of a bunch of Mario 64 levels" to create contrast with RTYI's style
- Significant technical challenges with collision mapping causing crashes due to polygon limits
- Physics engine completely overhauled: "I overhauled Mario's animation system. Mario's animations are now much more consistent"
- Three Yoshi stars per main level designed as collectibles "which are like green stars in our galaxy"

## Business Aspects
- Plans to make the development tools public: "I'm going to make the board public" for other ROM hackers to use
- No direct mentions of marketing, funding, or specific release/distribution plans found
- Anticipates the game will influence the ROM hacking community and potentially become a gateway for new players

## Key Quotes
- "the physics do feel infinitely better. Everything you do just works. Everything you do just works."
- "I think the contrast between Mario 64 levels and RTYI levels is going to be beautiful at display here"
- "You can have crazy geometry in this engine and it's going to perform better than the vanilla engine and the crazy geometry too"

## Potential Interview Topics
- The technical evolution of the physics engine and what specific improvements were made over vanilla Mario 64
- The collaborative process with Biobak and how the visual design evolved throughout development
- The design philosophy behind the final level and how it serves as a culmination of the project's themes
- The decision-making process for including Mario 64 retro elements and maintaining the game's identity
- Long-term vision for the game's impact on the ROM hacking community and plans for making development tools available to others
