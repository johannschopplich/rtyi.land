## Game Development Process
- The game is in late-stage development with most content complete: "it's almost finished. What even left to do other than the overworld? Just some side levels. But yeah, the overworld is pretty much the last part."
- Successfully runs at 60 FPS on real N64 hardware with advanced features: "Yeah, look there, 60 FPS... You even have graphic options like anti-aliasing on. And if you have a widescreen TV, you can even turn on widescreen."
- Current build size is approximately 60MB
- Working on overworld draft design, specifically focusing on level entrance mechanics and progression flow
- Beta testing is actively ongoing with community feedback being incorporated into design decisions

## Personal Insights
- Financial pressures from content creation: "at this point i have to finance my video editing with sponsor deals it is what it is"
- High investment in promotional content: "i have such a long video planned for next saturday i think this might hit a million views or it might just hit 300 000 and then i will be sad because it was very expensive to pay for the editing"
- Ongoing concern about Nintendo legal action: "Nintendo might just murder me. And then I have to re-run this game without loading or something like that"
- Commitment to quality over speed: willing to rework elements multiple times to achieve the right player experience
- Values community input and actively considers beta tester feedback in design decisions

## Collaborator Information
- Biomech: Graphics artist responsible for level reworks and visual improvements. Multiple references to "Biomech reworked" various levels and areas
- Zaina: Kaze's wife who handles animations and also cut his hair during the stream period
- Aza: Developer working on side levels, specifically mentioned as creating "a whole side level dedicated to crazy daisies"
- Lincoln: Community member who created thumbnail artwork for promotional content
- Other Contributors: Multiple beta testers providing ongoing feedback, various Discord community members contributing ideas and suggestions

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Major challenge with level entrance design due to technical limitations: "having the cloudcap in the overworld is going to be awkward because what if you just go to a previous part and then you know break the world geometry and look over the walls and see nothing"
- Implementing meaningful coin economy: "i definitely need something you can buy, though. Like, for sure... We just need ways to actually make coins feel valuable as well"
- Balancing overworld progression to avoid overwhelming players: "After you beat the second Bowser level, you kind of gain unrestricted access to all of this. And that is a little much, isn't it? Isn't this going to feel overwhelming?"
- Designing boss fight arenas that serve dual purposes without revealing their intended use prematurely
- Creating seamless overworld connectivity: "the entire overworld is going to be one huge map that's going to be seamless so you're going to be able to go everywhere without warping"

## Business Aspects
- Relying on sponsor deals to fund video production and marketing efforts
- Uncertainty about release timeline due to potential Nintendo legal concerns: "When will this game roughly be finished? I am not sure. Nintendo might just murder me"
- Investment in high-quality promotional content as a marketing strategy
- Considering backup plans in case of legal challenges from Nintendo
