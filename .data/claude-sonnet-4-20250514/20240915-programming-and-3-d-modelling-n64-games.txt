## Game Development Process
- The game is nearing completion with course 14 out of 15 currently in development, plus some side levels, overworld, and Bowser level still needed
- Course 15 is already halfway complete with assets programmed for a slide deck collaboration with Zeina
- A demo is in active development with Biobak working on the Course 1 remake specifically for inclusion
- Performance optimization for N64 hardware is an ongoing priority, with frame rate testing and optimization being a constant concern
- The current focus is on developing a cardboard/craft materials themed level with unique aesthetic and gameplay elements

## Personal Insights
- Kaze views YouTube content creation as necessary work while game development is the enjoyable part: "For me, YouTube at this point. This the job part and like making the game is the fun part."
- He has strong design principles, particularly opposing 2D sections in 3D games: "No, I don't like those 2D sections. I want this to be a 3D game entirely."
- He's committed to authentic N64 hardware compatibility rather than just emulation performance
- Kaze values community input during development streams but maintains creative control over final decisions
- He's conscious of the balance between technical constraints and creative vision

## Collaborator Information
- Biobak: Currently working on the Course 1 remake that will be included in the demo version of the game
- Zeina: Previously collaborated with Kaze on slide deck assets for course 15, contributing to animation work
- Unnamed Editor: Now handles Kaze's YouTube video editing, representing a shift from self-editing to professional production
- Sauron: Mentioned as working on RSP (Reality Signal Processor) optimization for the N64 hardware
- Other Contributors: Community members actively contribute design suggestions during development streams

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Developing a cohesive cardboard/craft materials aesthetic that feels authentic and handmade rather than digitally perfect
- Implementing glue as a gameplay mechanic that slows down player movement while maintaining visual believability
- Balancing the open nature of the cardboard level design with N64 hardware performance limitations
- Creating visual effects like fake normal mapping to simulate shiny paint textures within hardware constraints
- Designing level boundaries and death floors that feel natural within the craft materials theme rather than arbitrary game limits

## Business Aspects
- Recent YouTube video performance is exceptional with potential for reaching one million views, significantly outperforming previous content
- Strategic planning of future video content with approximately 20 different video concepts in development
- Previous experience with Nintendo takedowns (specifically "The Missing Link" project) influences current content strategy
- YouTube algorithm optimization through longer-form content (30+ minute videos) is a conscious strategy
- Content creation serves dual purposes of promotion and revenue generation to support game development

## Key Quotes
- "Oh yes, we're only at quest 14 out of 15. But of course there's some side levels missing, the overworld and the bowser level. But quest 15 is also already halfway done because I already programmed all the assets for it"
- "This level is gonna be very difficult to make run well on N64 because of how open it is."
- "This newest video. Fucking look at this. It's doing so well. It's got like 80% more views than my last video... This might be a 1 million view banger."
