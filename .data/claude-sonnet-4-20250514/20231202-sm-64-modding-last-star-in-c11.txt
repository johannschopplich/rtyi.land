## Game Development Process
- Course 4 has been completed and is ready for beta testing: "most of what i did off cam was actually fixing up course four i finished fixing up course four so it's ready for beta testing we're gonna send it off to be tested soon"
- Currently working on oil rig area with new enemy implementation (Fizz Oil enemy)
- Ongoing maintenance and bug fixing: "somehow whenever we work we're breaking a bunch of old levels so i'm going through them all again and fixing them in general like bug fixes that i found during testing"
- Zoo level repairs in progress with new animations being added
- New asset improvements including chain chomp remodel, new doll remodel, and updated character models
- Development using Fast64 tool with community contributions to improve the software

## Personal Insights
- Kaze reflects on financial and family responsibilities affecting development decisions: "it's not financially viable decision for me to make And I do have a family now that I need to provide for So I can't just fuck around with my time and do that. I have to make sensible decisions"
- Strong commitment to open source philosophy: "I will definitely open sources like no worry This is guaranteed open source I want people to be able to maintain this code base after I leave the scene And I want other people to be able to make hex off of my engine"
- Design philosophy emphasizing atmosphere over pure challenge: "not every enemy has to be like a super obstacle, right? It's fine if he's more optical than or vibe-giving than dangerous"
- Reflects on the revolutionary impact of Last Impact in the ROM hacking scene
- Expresses desire to eventually step back and let the community maintain the project

## Collaborator Information
- Zeina: Primary animator working on animations for the zoo level and other areas. Described as actively creating "a few animations that zena's making" for course 4 completion
- Biobank: Mentioned in context but specific contributions unclear from this transcript
- Fast64 Community: Multiple contributors working on improving the development tool, though Kaze wishes "there were more people working on fast 64"
- Beta Testers: Mentioned as recipients of completed course 4 for testing
- Other Contributors: No other specific named contributors identified in this transcript

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Creation of Fizz Oil enemy with specific behavioral mechanics: transforms from solid slime to puddle state when detecting Mario, creates slippery surfaces for environmental gameplay
- Balancing enemy difficulty and purpose: "They're here for the vibes, you know?" - prioritizing atmospheric contribution over pure challenge
- Technical challenges with N64-style modeling and rendering, particularly with oil drill design and environmental effects
- Environmental storytelling through oil rig setting with underwater sections and industrial atmosphere
- Implementation of soap-based enemy weakness system for boss fight hints
- Addressing collision and animation issues with enemy movement on stairs and varied terrain

## Business Aspects
- Legal strategy using patch releases to navigate copyright issues: "I get around legal stuff by just releasing a patch, yeah"
- Discussion of IP protection obligations for companies: "companies have an obligation to protect their IP if they want to keep their IP"
- Awareness of ongoing legal battles in ROM hacking community, mentioning someone hiring an IP lawyer
- Open source release plans to ensure project longevity and community maintenance
- Financial constraints preventing new N64 game development due to family responsibilities

## Key Quotes
- "I will definitely open sources like no worry This is guaranteed open source I want people to be able to maintain this code base after I leave the scene And I want other people to be able to make hex off of my engine"
- "not every enemy has to be like a super obstacle, right? It's fine if he's more optical than or vibe-giving than dangerous"
- "it's not financially viable decision for me to make And I do have a family now that I need to provide for So I can't just fuck around with my time and do that. I have to make sensible decisions"
