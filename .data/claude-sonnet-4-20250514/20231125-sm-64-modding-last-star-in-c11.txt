## Game Development Process
- Currently at approximately 75-80% completion with 15 total courses planned, working on course 11-12
- Implementing systematic bug fixes across all levels to prepare for beta testing
- Kaze has been setting and meeting daily deadlines for 14 consecutive days to maintain progress
- Development involves both engine work and level design, with significant technical work already completed
- Planning to make source code publicly available upon completion

## Personal Insights
- Strong commitment to deadline-driven development: "I started setting myself deadlines for stuff to work on right so I've done this for 14 days now and so far I fit every single deadline"
- Unique approach to difficulty progression: "I don't try to make the levels more difficult. I just put the threshold of how cool a jump has to be for it to be worth the difficulty lower"
- Critical view of modern game design: "Modern game design is made for people that are depressed and just want to erase time. Not for people that want to go have an experience"
- Balancing player accessibility with challenge through optional movement mechanics

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: No specific mention found in this transcript
- Biobak: Graphics artist actively collaborating on textures and visual elements, involved in technical discussions about N64 limitations and visual design solutions
- Zeina: No specific mention found in this transcript  
- Other Contributors: 
  - Lila: Animator working on quaternion animations, has been absent for a week causing concern about project completion
  - Unnamed musician working on the game's soundtrack, with plans for Kaze to potentially purchase music rights for an album release

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Working within severe N64 texture memory constraints (4096 bytes total)
- Implementing hydraulic platform systems with variable speeds for enhanced visual appeal and gameplay variety
- Designing levels with multiple accessibility options while maintaining challenge for skilled players
- Creating custom warp systems with additional parameters for height and camera angles
- Balancing visual fidelity with technical limitations through creative texture compression solutions

## Business Aspects
- Plans for simultaneous release strategy: launching Return to Yoshi's Island alongside a Kickstarter for a separate Unreal Engine game
- Intention to make source code open and publicly accessible
- Considering releasing a physical soundtrack album in N64 cartridge format
- Working full-time job at Gears for Breakfast while developing the game
- Strategic approach to YouTube content creation to maintain channel visibility during development

## Key Quotes
- "I don't like modern game design. Modern game design is made for people that are depressed and just want to erase time. Not for people that want to go have an experience"
- "I actually have a really good method for making a good difficulty curve. And that is that I don't try to make the levels more difficult. I just put the threshold of how cool a jump has to be for it to be worth the difficulty lower"
- "I seriously doubt anyone is gonna have the skill to make a pc port of this or the patience because it's just gonna take so long"
