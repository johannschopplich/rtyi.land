## Game Development Process
- Currently working on the first star of a level, which Kaze considers will be "such a huge step" when completed
- Actively optimizing the game for N64 hardware compatibility and ROM size (currently under 43 megabytes)
- Planning release for "the 30th" which appears to be tied to a competition deadline
- Implementing complex interactive systems like Womp towers, cement pits, and character interactions
- Managing multiple technical challenges including sound system limitations and performance optimization

## Personal Insights
- Kaze demonstrates strong design philosophy around player guidance, preferring "show don't tell" approaches over explicit instructions
- Values humor and comedy as core elements: "This level is so fucking funny. How is this level so funny? Between all the comedic things and the animations"
- Shows perfectionist tendencies and attention to player experience details
- Believes in creating multiple layers of hints rather than single obvious solutions: "we had like six layers of protection and everyone was bound to find one of them"
- Has moved from Twitch to YouTube for streaming due to ad frustrations

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub**: Composer who recently returned to the project after a break, currently working on a song for a week with "10 different tries" showing dedication to quality
- **Zeina**: Animator working on Womp animations and other character movements, actively collaborating during the stream
- **Biobak**: Graphics artist mentioned in context of ongoing work, though specific contributions not detailed in this session
- **Other Contributors**: Lila (providing feedback and suggestions), various community members offering design ideas and input during the stream

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Implementing multi-layered mission design where players must interact with five different worker characters
- Balancing technical limitations (N64 hardware, ROM size) with creative ambitions
- Creating intuitive player guidance without explicit instruction through environmental storytelling
- Developing comedy-focused gameplay mechanics while maintaining Mario 64's core feel
- Managing sound system limitations requiring creative workarounds for overlapping audio
- Optimizing particle systems and visual effects within hardware constraints

## Business Aspects
- Release tied to competition deadline (mentioned as "the 30th")
- ROM size optimization directly impacts feature implementation and performance
- Platform migration from Twitch to YouTube for content creation
- No explicit mention of funding or marketing strategies in this session

## Key Quotes
- "We will finally have finished the first star in this level. That's going to feel like such a huge step."
- "I like to design the missions and none of the hints were overbearing right if you found one of them And figured it out from just one hint you'd be like, oh my god I'm so smart"
- "This level is so fucking funny. How is this level so funny? Between all the comedic things and the animations."

## Potential Interview Topics
