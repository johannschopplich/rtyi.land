## Game Development Process
- Currently working on Course 14, a craft/paper-themed level featuring styrofoam landscapes, cardboard elements, and paper snow effects
- Demo release planned "in a few weeks" to showcase improvements made since the last demo version
- Development follows an iterative approach with constant refinements and community feedback integration
- The game features a seven-star system with redesigned mechanics compared to original Mario 64
- Progress appears to be in later stages, with Kaze mentioning they're "already in the last three areas here"

## Personal Insights
- Kaze views the project as representing what "video games should be like," emphasizing creative, handcrafted gameplay experiences
- He takes pride in the authentic craft aesthetic, noting how completed areas "look like someone's shitty crayon drawing like they couldn't follow the lines correctly"
- Shows willingness to include seemingly pointless but charming elements, like giving players "nothing" except "a new hat for the guy" as a demo reward
- Expresses passion for the project while maintaining a pragmatic approach to development constraints

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: No relevant information found in this transcript
- Biobak: Actively involved in graphics work, with Kaze regularly seeking their opinion on visual elements like styrofoam textures and level aesthetics. Has completed rework on various graphical elements
- Zeina: Handles animation work, with Kaze planning to request improved versions of temporary textures and visual elements from them
- Other Contributors: Active community involvement with chat members providing real-time feedback, suggestions for naming conventions (like "Game & Match" matchboxes), and general design input

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Redesigned coin collection system: "red coins in this game are always contained to one area because otherwise red coins suck"
- Implemented a unique seven-star system where Yoshi coins serve as special objectives for exploration and rare interactions
- Eliminated traditional 100-coin stars entirely, replacing them with exploration-based mechanics
- Technical challenges include optimizing performance while maintaining the craft aesthetic, particularly with particle effects and lighting systems
- Innovative approach to level progression where stars don't kick players out of levels to encourage continued exploration

## Business Aspects
- Explicit commitment to free distribution: "Of course it will be free download. I can't charge money for this, Nintendo would actually murder me"
- Previous experience with Nintendo legal action in 2019, including a DMCA takedown that he responded to unprofessionally
- Awareness of legal constraints preventing monetization due to Nintendo's intellectual property
- No mention of funding sources or marketing plans beyond community engagement

## Key Quotes
- "God, this is such a cool mission. This is what video games should be like."
- "my priority today is not on entertaining but rather on getting work done which you know it always is but this time even more so"
- "I think it's perfect for a demo and I will literally give the player nothing for doing it other than a new hat for the guy"

## Potential Interview Topics
- The philosophy behind the craft/handmade aesthetic and how it influences gameplay design decisions
- The collaborative process with community members and how feedback shapes development
- Technical challenges of working within Mario 64's limitations while implementing new mechanics
- The evolution of the coin collection system and motivation for departing from traditional Mario 64 design
- Balancing creative vision with legal constraints and Nintendo's intellectual property concerns
