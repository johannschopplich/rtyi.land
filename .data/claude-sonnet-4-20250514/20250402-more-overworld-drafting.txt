## Game Development Process
- All 15 courses are completed, indicating the project is in late-stage development focused on overworld design and progression flow
- Currently working on parts 10-15 of the overworld, with specific focus on creating proper progression barriers to prevent overwhelming player choice
- Actively seeking beta testing solutions: "I need is a reliable way to just find people that are willing to play my game for me. I do need this because I want to do a bunch of gameplay testing"
- Technical optimization ongoing with triangle count management (mentioned 3,000 triangles for one area)
- Planning pause menu implementation with full world map functionality

## Personal Insights
- Strong philosophy about meaningful exploration: "I think that's kind of how video games should all be like. And adding a secret back entrance here that does nothing is kind of cool"
- Vision for interconnected world design: "It's just going to feel like a gigantic open world. It's going to be insane, man. Just think about it. The whole world is going to feel so alive"
- Draws inspiration from classic games, particularly Ocarina of Time's approach to secrets and world design
- Values player agency while recognizing the need for guided progression to avoid overwhelming choices
- Believes in creating atmosphere through environmental storytelling and hidden details

## Collaborator Information

- Biobak: No relevant information found in this transcript  
- Zeina: No relevant information found in this transcript
- Other Contributors: Martisti - Level designer working on a Greek garden level described as "super cool" that will be located around course 10 in the third overworld area

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Major challenge with progression flow: preventing players from accessing parts 10-15 simultaneously to avoid choice paralysis
- Implementing creative progression barriers using narrative elements (evil yappy blocks enhanced by Kamek magic)
- Designing meaningful overworld events, including a bone dragon interaction that subverts player expectations (inspired by "Fable of the Mouse and the Lion")
- Creating interconnected areas without loading zones while managing technical constraints
- Balancing exploration rewards with practical gameplay progression
- Developing solutions for seamless world connectivity while maintaining performance

## Business Aspects
- Distribution planning includes potential PAL version: "Maybe both, but right now only NTSC is being worked on. It shouldn't be difficult to also port it to PAL though"
- Reference to commissioned work (Drag Wars) indicating Kaze takes on paid development projects
- No specific marketing, funding, or release timeline discussions in this transcript
