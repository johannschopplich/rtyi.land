## Game Development Process
- The game is in an advanced development stage with multiple levels being reworked and polished. Kaze mentions "this ship is years old, but this is a rework. We have a bunch like prettier looking levels now."
- Development follows an iterative approach with continuous refinement: "Course 5" (pirate ship level) was created 3 years ago but is currently receiving a major visual overhaul
- Plans for open source release upon completion: "when i release this hack my engine will be public i'll make the hack open source like all of it at the same time"
- The project utilizes a custom optimized engine that Kaze has developed, which he shares with select ROM hackers but hasn't publicly released yet

## Personal Insights
- Kaze has strong opinions about art and creative expression: "I don't like paintings at all. I'm a painting hater. I don't like that like paintings are synonymous with art. I think that's stupid."
- Critical view of programming work culture: "Every time I hear a programmer talk about their job, it just sounds like they're doing nothing all day... Programmers are being over-employed"
- Values functionality over trends: "I would still be using windows 7 if it was a viable option" and expresses frustration with modern software bloat
- Prioritizes player experience over artificial difficulty: "Difficulty here is unnecessary" when discussing puzzle design philosophy

## Collaborator Information
- **Biomech/Biobak**: Primary graphics artist responsible for major level reworks and 3D modeling. Created updated pirate ship with "A thousand seven hundred triangles only" while maintaining high visual quality. Provides detailed changelogs and technical specifications for asset integration.
- **Badoob**: Composer working on music for different themed areas. Recent work on saloon music was deemed "too upbeat and happy" requiring revision to match the intended atmosphere.
- **Zeina**: Mentioned as handling animations (limited detail in transcript)
- **Other Contributors**: 2090 case (worked on earlier level versions), Fast 64 tool developers (development environment), and unnamed ROM hacking community members

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Technical constraints of N64 hardware drive many design decisions: "applying the clear color takes around three milliseconds which is like 10 percent of the render time of a frame"
- Rendering optimization challenges: "You can't have lighting and vertex colors at the same time" requiring creative solutions for visual effects
- Gameplay philosophy emphasizing intuitive design over artificial difficulty, particularly in puzzle mechanics
- Visual storytelling integration: "every time you catch an outlaw the outlaw will be in here so this jail cell slowly fills up as you collect stars"
- Careful balance between polygon count and visual fidelity to maintain performance on original hardware

## Business Aspects
- Commitment to open source release with no apparent commercial monetization strategy
- Engine technology will be made publicly available upon game completion
- Currently selective sharing of development tools with other ROM hackers in the community
- No discussion of funding, marketing, or traditional business considerations - appears to be a passion project

## Key Quotes
- "when i release this hack my engine will be public i'll make the hack open source like all of it at the same time" - demonstrates commitment to community contribution
- "Difficulty here is unnecessary" - reveals player-focused design philosophy prioritizing enjoyment over challenge
- "Every time I hear a programmer talk about their job, it just sounds like they're doing nothing all day" - shows Kaze's strong work ethic and opinions about software development culture

## Potential Interview Topics
- The evolution of the project from initial concept to current advanced state, particularly the decision to rework levels created years ago
- Technical innovation in ROM hacking and the development of custom optimization engines for retro hardware
- The collaborative process of working with remote contributors across different creative disciplines (art, music, programming)
- Philosophy behind open source release and community contribution in the ROM hacking scene
- Balancing authentic N64 hardware constraints with modern development techniques and visual expectations
