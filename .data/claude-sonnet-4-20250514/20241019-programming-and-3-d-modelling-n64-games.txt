## Game Development Process
- The demo is complete with all N64 bugs fixed, indicating the project is in advanced stages
- Kaze is working on detailed mechanics like paper plane physics, rubber band animations, and NPC interactions
- The game runs at optimized frame rates (60fps in some areas, nearly 50fps with anti-aliasing)
- Course analysis videos are planned for each level before implementing a "remix" version
- Development involves iterative programming and testing of complex physics systems

## Personal Insights
- Kaze believes the 3D platformer market has a low bar for success and that creating a non-terrible game will be popular
- He expresses frustration with audience questions about unfinished features during development streams
- Plans to transition to commercial game development using Unreal Engine 5 after completing this project
- Shows confidence in his technical abilities and has a clear vision for both current and future projects
- Values time efficiency in development and content creation processes

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: No specific mentions found in this transcript
- Biobak: No specific mentions found in this transcript  
- Zeina: No specific mentions found in this transcript
- Other Contributors: An unnamed animator works on the game (Kaze states "I'm not the animator for this game anyway"), and someone else creates YouTube shorts for his channel

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Complex paper plane physics programming requiring balance between realism and gameplay functionality
- Technical optimization for N64 hardware limitations while maintaining visual quality
- Implementation of anti-aliasing and visual improvements for better presentation
- Programming interactive NPCs (like the Toad character) with proper animations and star-giving mechanics
- Balancing mechanical precision with entertaining gameplay elements

## Business Aspects
- Strategic YouTube content planning around game releases for maximum impact
- Consideration of separate social media accounts for future commercial game projects
- Plans for hardware review content to build audience and credibility
- Future commercial game development planned in Unreal Engine 5 as a 3D platformer

## Key Quotes
- "I think the bar for 3D platformers is so incredibly low that making a 3D platformer is easy at this point... if you just make a hack or make a game that doesn't suck, I think it's going to be popular."
- "I want to have the videos done before the remix exists. Just so we have a better point to start from. It's going to be more time efficient that way."
- "Obviously, it will be a 3D platformer. I don't think I expected anything else here... this is a pure fun platformer game. It's kind of exactly what many people want that you're not really getting anymore."

## Potential Interview Topics
