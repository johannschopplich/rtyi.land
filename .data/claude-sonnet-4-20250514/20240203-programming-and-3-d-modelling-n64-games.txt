## Game Development Process
- Major milestone: Complete collision system rewrite implemented, started the day before the stream, representing a fundamental technical overhaul
- Significant progress on multiple levels: bulletin board completion, Monty Mall mission development, and finished minecart mission showcase
- Game scope: Estimated 10-12 hour runtime with approximately 180 stars across roughly 50 courses, currently working on course 12 with "3.5 levels left"
- Course reordering consideration: Planning to move Wild West level to course 13 for better pacing between story-driven and experiential levels

## Personal Insights
- Core design philosophy: "I don't think Mario 64 is that great either, except for the movement design. Like the level design itself is not great, but the movement is like awesome. So that's the part I want to change."
- Level design approach: Wants mix of levels "made for Mario" versus levels that "just exist and Mario is experiencing them" to avoid every level feeling like it's specifically designed around Mario
- Technical perfectionism: Willingness to completely rewrite core systems mid-development for better quality
- Creative vision over authenticity: Questions whether voice acting should exactly imitate originals or serve the game's creative vision

## Collaborator Information
- Zeina: Primary animator creating spin jump animations and textures, also created bulletin board artwork; notably lives upstairs in the same house as Kaze, suggesting close collaborative relationship
- Badub: Composer creating music for the game, with Kaze noting "you have to ask the dupe whenever he feels like it" regarding music releases
- Biobak: Graphics artist "making a lot of stuff" for visual assets
- Other Contributors: CDI mentioned as collaborator on previous "Missing Link" Zelda project, described as providing significant help

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Collision system overhaul: Complete rewrite of Mario's collision detection for improved stability and functionality, moving away from problematic Mario 64 physics
- Animation design: Spin jump based on Mario's Down-B from Super Smash Bros. Melee rather than a "twirl" that "looked bad"
- Gameplay mechanics: Yoshi coins replacing traditional 100-coin stars, bomb-omb caps used for breakable boulder entrance mechanics
- Storytelling approach: Bank robbery storyline with environmental storytelling through Monty Mole tunnels, balancing obvious vs. discoverable elements
- Character design: Detailed work on Wild West bank employee Koopa with period-appropriate accessories (glasses, beard, tie)

## Business Aspects
- No explicit marketing, funding, or distribution plans mentioned
- Open source approach: Custom GCC compiler version mentioned as available "somewhere deep in my discords"
- Asset usage philosophy: Pragmatic approach to using external assets, noting "we're already romhacking right we might as well just take assets from Google"

## Key Quotes
- "Once my new collision system is done, dude, this game will be so nice collision-wise, I think. Much better than any other Mario 64 thing."
- "We want a lot of them to feel more like they are there and Mario is experiencing them"
- "I've heard people say that Madness is the only good tag I made because it has the most soul. Everything else after that is just like mainstream garbage, but Madness, it had soul."

## Potential Interview Topics
- The technical decision-making process behind completely rewriting the collision system mid-development and the risks/benefits involved
- Living and working dynamics with Zeina, including how close collaboration affects the creative process
- Evolution of design philosophy from previous projects like "Mario 64 Madness" to current approach in "Return to Yoshi's Island"
- Balancing authenticity to Mario 64's feel while implementing significant improvements and innovations
- Community engagement during development and how streaming/feedback influences design decisions
