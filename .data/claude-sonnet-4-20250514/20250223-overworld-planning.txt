## Game Development Process
- The overworld design represents "the last major thing we have to do" before release, indicating the project is in its final development phase
- Course 15 is completed, showing substantial progress on individual levels
- The team is completely remaking the overworld to better integrate all game elements
- Development follows a methodical approach: 2D sketching, then 3D modeling, followed by beta testing for iterative refinement
- The overworld is planned to be approximately four times the size of Super Mario 64's hub world

## Personal Insights
- Kaze demonstrates strong commitment to the project, continuing development work despite being ill
- He expresses high excitement about the overworld's potential: "This is going to pull the whole game together"
- Shows perfectionist tendencies and concern about quality control when collaborating with others
- Values player experience highly, emphasizing that "if you can see it as a player then you can go there"
- Maintains active community engagement through streaming and incorporating chat suggestions

## Collaborator Information
- Zeina: Creating animations and working on level design, specifically mentioned as drawing rainbow board-style elements and creating a "gimmicky" slide level
- Biobak: Graphics artist who appears to be actively involved in ongoing development discussions (referenced multiple times as "Biobank")
- BoB: Potential music arranger being considered for OST work, though Kaze expresses hesitation about quality control
- Other Contributors: Kaze works for Gears for Breakfast professionally, and various community members contribute ideas through chat

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Implementing star-gating progression system with in-game narrative justification (Bowser's magic barriers)
- Creating intuitive level discovery mechanics, including lighthouse/light beam puzzles for ghost ship entrance
- Designing pipe-based fast travel system to reduce backtracking after area completion
- Balancing linear progression with open exploration in a interconnected overworld
- Ensuring every visible area is accessible to maintain player trust and exploration satisfaction
- Integrating 14 distinct themed areas while maintaining cohesive world design

## Business Aspects
- No firm commitment to 2025 release date, prioritizing quality over timeline
- Kaze expresses reluctance to outsource work due to quality control concerns and difficulty rejecting subpar contributions
- Professional relationship with Gears for Breakfast provides income stability during development
- No specific mention of funding, marketing, or distribution plans

## Key Quotes
- "The overworld is so important what we're going to do, we're going to plan it and we're going to make a 2D sketch here and we're going to make a 3D sketch with all the double entrances drawn in."
- "That's going to be such a banger overworld. The way it's going so far. Holy shit, this is going to pull the whole game together."
- "I also have this weird thing where I do not want to reach out to people and ask for help because a lot of the time I feel like I'm gonna say all this actually isn't up to the quality standards I expect."

## Potential Interview Topics
- The evolution of the overworld design and how it differs from the original concept
- Challenges of maintaining quality control while working with remote collaborators
- The decision-making process behind star-gating and progression mechanics
- How working professionally at Gears for Breakfast influences the indie development process
- The technical innovations required to create an interconnected overworld within N64 hardware constraints
