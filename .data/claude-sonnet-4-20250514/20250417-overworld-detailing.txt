## Game Development Process
- Currently in "Part 13" of development, focusing on overworld design and layout planning
- Major sound engine overhaul in progress: "I have made huge performance improvements. I have reduced the code size by probably like five kilobytes at this point"
- Planning phase for reaching 200 total stars (currently at 189 planned)
- Open source release confirmed: "Will rtyi be open source on release? Yes definitely. I do want people to use my engine to make more romhacks and to improve on my performance optimizations"
- Transitioning from core mechanics to content creation and single-mechanic focused side levels

## Personal Insights
- Technical perfectionism driving major engine rewrites: "Mario 64 sound engine. It sucks. I'm kind of just ripping it out, making my own"
- Self-critical about visual progress: "Why does everyone say this all looks good? It looks like absolute garbage"
- Pragmatic attitude toward potential Nintendo action: "Are you scared that they will take down the game? No. I mean, they might, but like... If it happens, it happens. It's not the end of the world"
- Balancing ambition with practical constraints: "At this point I don't want to add side levels that add that much work to the project"
- Busy schedule affecting development pace: "Oh my god, I'm so busy"

## Collaborator Information
- Marty: Currently working on the "Green Japanese Garden side level"
- Zeina: Working on animations, specifically mentioned in context of "Forgotten Fortress doesn't even have star names yet because we're still waiting for Zeno to finish the last area"
- Biobak: Actively providing input during development streams, contributing to design discussions
- Zell: Paid contractor who "made some changes to Missing Link" several months ago
- Other Contributors: Various community members contributing ideas and feedback during live development streams

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Complete sound engine rewrite for performance optimization and bug fixes: "I've probably spent the last four or five days non-stop on it"
- Strategic decision to focus on single-mechanic side levels to manage development scope
- Overworld design challenge of balancing empty space with meaningful content and activities
- Star count management aiming for exactly 200 stars to avoid awkward numbers like "192 stars"
- Mechanical reuse strategy: "I just want to reuse what I already have" rather than creating new complex systems

## Business Aspects
- Working with sponsorship agency LFI for video monetization, though experiencing payment and invoicing issues
- Recent Squarespace sponsorship deal resolution: "Yo, my Squarespace issue just got resolved. Let's fucking go"
- Smartphone review deal for secondary channel content
- Open source business model planned to benefit the broader ROM hacking community
- Video creation driven by sponsorship needs: "I'm making videos now, because I have sponsors and I need to make videos"

## Key Quotes
- "I'm kind of just ripping it out, making my own. And it's been a serious effort. I've probably spent the last four or five days non-stop on it. But I have made huge performance improvements."
- "If it happens, it happens. It's not the end of the world. I can still just turn it into my own branded game, hopefully. I'm going to use it as PR and make something even more interesting."
- "I do want people to use my engine to make more romhacks and to improve on my performance optimizations"

## Potential Interview Topics
