## Game Development Process
- Currently working on art style development for an ice castle level, focusing on establishing visual aesthetics before level design implementation
- Developing a custom operating system for Nintendo 64 to replace libultra, indicating deep technical modifications to the base engine
- The project appears to be in active development with regular streaming sessions showing iterative progress
- Level design follows a methodical approach: establish art style first, then build geometry and gameplay elements
- Performance optimization is a constant consideration, with 60fps being the target for N64 hardware

## Personal Insights
- Kaze views the original Nintendo 64 operating systems (Mario 64's system and libultra) as inadequate: "Basically, the operating system Nintendo wrote for Mario 64 sucked. And then later they wrote one called Libultra, and it still sucks. So I'm just gonna write a better one."
- Strong artistic philosophy: "I think art is about making you feel emotion"
- Values technical freedom and control: "We have been freed from the oppression that compilers have caused us"
- Maintains high standards for visual quality, willing to restart work if not satisfied with results
- Balances professional game development work with personal ROM hacking projects

## Collaborator Information
- Badub ("the dupe"): Composer who has created multiple musical pieces for the project, including specific tracks for the ice castle level
- Biobak/Biomag: Graphics artist whose opinion on visual elements carries significant weight in design decisions - "But if Biomag says this doesn't look good, honestly, we're cooked"
- Zeina: Involved in providing visual references and feedback, sends concept art images for inspiration
- Other Contributors: Community members like Lila/Lilo Heaven provide technical assistance with Blender geometry nodes, XPM shares texture resources

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Struggling with ice castle visual design: "I don't like how this level looks at all... I think this just looks like garbage like all around. And we need something different entirely"
- Technical constraints limit artistic vision: "The one big problem we'll have is that we can't do the darkness here unless we give up on the environment map or on the fog"
- Prioritizing visual cohesion over individual elements: "We're exploring the space of possibilities and trying to get something that we can work with in the future that looks good"
- Balancing technical performance with visual complexity for N64 hardware limitations
- Using iterative approach with team feedback to refine artistic direction

## Business Aspects
- Kaze works professionally at Gears for Breakfast game studio, requiring disclaimers about personal opinions
- Streaming provides minimal income: "My Twitch is currently not working. It's like barely profitable. I think on Twitch I make like 50 bucks a month"
- No mention of commercial plans for the ROM hack itself, appears to be a passion project
- Project development happens during personal time outside professional work

## Key Quotes
- "We're exploring the space of possibilities and trying to get something that we can work with in the future that looks good. We can't just be like, oh, first thing that looks good, let's jump on it."
- "The ice castle will be a full level, but we haven't even finished one room yet. We're working on making the art stuff where it looks good. Before we even try to make the level."
- "I think art is about making you feel emotion. And if I made a track like that, I would want to make you feel pure hatred."

## Potential Interview Topics
