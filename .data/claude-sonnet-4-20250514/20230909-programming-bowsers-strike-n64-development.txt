## Game Development Process
- The game is approximately 75% complete, indicating it's in advanced development stages
- Currently working on multiple levels including Bowser's office with elevator mechanics, biomech level improvements, and planning Wild West Valley
- Development follows an iterative approach with constant refinement of existing content
- Next immediate milestone is completing Wiggler programming and implementing the boss fight
- The game features significantly more content and dialogue than the original Mario 64 ("169 dialogues. It's already more than double")

## Personal Insights
- Kaze is thoughtful about AI's impact on creativity: "I tend to avoid using AI because sure some things might be easier but if you keep using AI for so long you're just missing out on learning something yourself"
- Expresses existential concerns about AI replacing human creativity: "It's like why even try if something better can be done without any effort?"
- Struggles with YouTube monetization: "YouTube is just not profitable for me because my channel is not that big or interesting"
- Faces personal financial challenges despite creative success: "I can't get a fucking loan for a house. Even though the mortgage is about as much as rent"
- Shows strong commitment to quality and learning through hands-on experience

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub (Composer)**: Created adaptive music for the second Bowser level that can switch between indoor/outdoor versions by enabling/disabling channels. Kaze notes "I don't think Badoob wants to compose a 45 minute album," indicating the scope of musical content needed
- **Biobak (Graphics Artist)**: Handles 3D modeling work and contributes design ideas. Not a programmer but provides visual assets and creative input on level design
- **Zeina (Animator)**: Created new Wiggler animations including angry expressions, talking animations, and stomping sequences. Kaze praises the animation quality and notes improvement in speed and skill
- **Other Contributors**: Legwood serves as video editor for YouTube shorts content, representing Kaze's broader content strategy

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Complex mission structure with interconnected NPC interactions: "So you have the glass guys, you have the cement guy, you have the Goomba on a lunch break, and you have the thwomps lined up"
- Strike/union mission featuring environmental storytelling where "All the minions gather around Bowser's plaza and they're on a strike"
- Planned Wild West Valley level with cowboys, villain-catching mechanics, and wanted posters
- Technical challenges with N64 hardware limitations, particularly around collision detection and camera systems
- Balancing accessibility with complexity, ensuring hints are available for voluntary interactions

## Business Aspects
- Legal caution regarding physical distribution: "I'm not gonna make a physical cartridge because if I do I will get sued to shit. But I might make a box and an instruction booklet and all that and I'm probably gonna sell those as merch"
- Investment in YouTube content strategy, paying $5 per short created with mixed ROI results
- Consideration of alternative distribution methods including QR codes in merchandise to link to download
- Revenue challenges despite creative success, with game development not providing sufficient income for major life purchases
