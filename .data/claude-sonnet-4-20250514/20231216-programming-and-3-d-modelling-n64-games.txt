## Game Development Process
- Currently working on Course 12, a cowboy-themed level called "Wild West Valley"
- Development has slowed significantly since Course 9 due to Kaze obtaining a full-time job
- Following a structured level design process: 1) settle on building style, 2) draw overhead map, 3) make block out, 4) make it look decent
- Using Fast64 plugin for Blender to export levels into the Mario 64 decompilation
- Working within N64 hardware limitations, particularly texture resolution (64x64 maximum) and polygon constraints
- The level features an ambitious design with multiple areas connected by a train system for fast travel

## Personal Insights
- Kaze wants to create an extremely stereotypical western experience, describing himself as wanting to be a "cowboyaboo" - overdoing cowboy culture similar to how "weeaboos" overdo Japanese culture
- He prioritizes making the level "goofy and funny" rather than "dark and gritty"
- Shows perfectionist tendencies, particularly regarding visual design and color palettes
- Expresses frustration with technical limitations but remains committed to his creative vision
- Values community input through live streaming but maintains strong personal artistic direction

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: Composer who created a custom western-themed song for the level. Kaze expresses genuine excitement about the collaboration, stating the music influences level design decisions like adding fog effects
- Biobak: Graphics contributor who provides feedback during the stream, particularly regarding building designs and visual references
- Zeina: Mentioned briefly as someone close to Kaze who "just came home with a new house" - appears to be involved in the project but role unclear from this transcript
- Other Contributors: Active chat community providing real-time feedback on design decisions, art style suggestions, and gameplay ideas

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Struggling to find the right art style and color palette for western buildings that works within N64 limitations
- Designing a level around an outlaw-catching theme with three boss fights, each rewarding a star
- Creating a functional train system connecting three areas (town, valley, train headquarters)
- Balancing platforming gameplay with authentic western aesthetics (example: slanted walls look better but are harder to platform on)
- Working with fog effects that require expensive 2-cycle materials, causing performance concerns
- Planning complex mission structure including bank robbery, saloon shootout, and train robbery scenarios

## Business Aspects
- Mentions that Nintendo took down his tutorials, suggesting previous friction with the company
- Streaming on both Twitch and YouTube simultaneously with donations enabled
- No specific mentions of marketing, funding plans, or distribution strategies for the completed game

## Key Quotes
- "I want people to look at this and be like, wow, okay, chill out. You know how people that pretend to be Japanese, like weeaboos, how they completely overdo Japanese culture or what they perceive to be Japanese culture? I want it to be that, but for cowboys."
- "development has slowed down ever since the end of course 9, because I have a full-time job now."
- "This is supposed to be like a goofy, funny cowboy town. Not dark, gritty."

## Potential Interview Topics
- How balancing a full-time job affects creative passion projects and development timeline management
- The technical and creative challenges of working within N64 hardware limitations while pursuing modern design ambitions
- The role of live streaming and community feedback in the iterative design process
- Collaboration dynamics with music composers and how audio influences level design decisions
- The decision to work with Mario 64 decompilation versus other game development approaches
