## Game Development Process
- Currently in refinement/polish phase with active bug fixing: "So our mission today is fixing the Goombas fight. Biobank wanted to make a few changes to it. And I'm up for it."
- Four years of N64-compatible development: "We've only been doing N64 compatible hacks for four years. And I've only tried to make them run well for three years."
- Recent technical improvements including N64 bug fixes, lighting system repairs, and experimental bloom effects
- Integration of new animations and models from collaborators, particularly Goomba King assets
- Boss fight mechanics being redesigned based on collaborator feedback

## Personal Insights
- Frustration with audience misconceptions: "It's also like that people don't understand that I'm making a game. They think I'm just making videos."
- Philosophy on game development: "if you want to be successful making video games you need to be mentally unwell... You need to be completely insane."
- Balancing YouTube content creation with actual game development, expressing concern about audience expectations vs. his actual goals
- Strong belief in the iterative process and willingness to rework features multiple times for quality

## Collaborator Information
- Biobank: Graphics artist actively involved in design decisions, contributed ideas for boss fight changes and YouTube video titles ("biobank's idea was the secret reason i've been rewriting mario 64")
- Zayna: Animator responsible for Goomba King animations and other character work, with ongoing communication about needed assets
- Zell: Working on "missing link version updates" and being compensated for the work
- Other Contributors: Fast64 tool developers, various community members providing feedback during streams

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Boss fight redesign: "You want the Goomba to pick a place. He just walks there. And then the boulder follows Mario. Not the other way around. So you have to aim the boulder at him."
- Technical optimization challenges, particularly with expensive effects like bloom filters (7 milliseconds of RDP time)
- Animation synchronization issues causing visual bugs (Goombas teleporting/disappearing during fight sequences)
- Collision detection and geometry refinement for improved gameplay flow
- Balancing visual fidelity with N64 hardware limitations

## Business Aspects
- Strategic YouTube video planning with specific upload schedule: "My video plan. Hopefully this Saturday, the BLJ video. Then hopefully two to three weeks after that..."
- Title optimization for view maximization, with Biobank's suggestions potentially increasing views from 80k to 400k
- Payment of collaborators (specifically mentions paying Zell for work)
- Concern about being perceived as "YouTube slop" vs. genuine educational content
- Using YouTube channel to build awareness for the actual game project

## Key Quotes
- "It's also like that people don't understand that I'm making a game. They think I'm just making videos."
- "if you want to be successful making video games you need to be mentally unwell... You need to be completely insane."
- "We've only been doing N64 compatible hacks for four years. And I've only tried to make them run well for three years."
