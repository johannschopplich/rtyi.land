## Game Development Process
- Currently developing a Wild West themed level with detailed planning for town areas, canyons, and scavenger hunt mechanics
- Game consists of 15 total courses, indicating substantial overall progress
- Technical constraint of staying within 64 megabyte N64 cartridge limits demonstrates commitment to authentic hardware compatibility
- Working on intro cutscenes synchronized to music, showing attention to cinematic presentation
- Development involves real-time community feedback during live streams, creating an interactive development process

## Personal Insights
- Strong game design philosophy emphasizing accessibility: "if you make a game that is just not offensive to the player, just like an inoffensive easy platformer with no frustration, no friction, just like easily solvable everything, people will fucking love it"
- Critical view of modern games: "I would like to give the game of the year award to no one. All of your games sucked"
- Preference for avoiding community drama: "Honestly, I think it is best if me and Skalox just do not acknowledge each other's existence anymore"
- Values technical precision and authentic N64 development over convenience tools
- Believes in iterative design based on player experience rather than strict adherence to original mechanics

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: Primary composer who "always makes the music for my levels. Nowadays at least." Creates level-specific music that drives cutscene timing and atmosphere
- Biobak: Graphics artist working on area completion, with ongoing payment coordination challenges due to PayPal restrictions and cryptocurrency complications
- Zeina: 3D artist/animator creating skull and skeleton models for the Wild West level, with Kaze expressing satisfaction with the quality: "Oh, that looks really good, Zainer. I like that a lot"
- Other Contributors: PowerJay (pipe model contributions), Mr. Comet (referenced for Monster Hunter 64 work)

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Implementing a scavenger hunt system where "Mario's goal in this area is gonna be to find the treasure" with progressive hint-giving NPCs
- Creating a surreal canyon area with "Wild West references Just things that are symbolic for it" including giant shotguns, wheels, skulls, and hoof irons as platforming elements
- Solving navigation challenges through color-coded pipe systems while maintaining visual coherence and accessibility for colorblind players
- Balancing authentic N64 limitations with modern game design expectations
- Technical challenges with texture management and model optimization for console compatibility

## Business Aspects
- Must release for free due to copyright concerns: "I unfortunately cannot monetize this I have to release it for free or I will get murdered"
- Committed to open source release: "Yeah, the game will be open source"
- Experiencing practical payment difficulties with international collaborators due to PayPal restrictions requiring cryptocurrency workarounds
- Works professionally at Gears for Breakfast while developing this project as a passion project

## Key Quotes
- "So I had this idea for a ROM hack. This concept. I have this theory, and this is because I played Spongebob Battle for Bikini Bottom, I have this theory that games are just so goddamn bad that if you make a game that is just not offensive to the player, just like an inoffensive easy platformer with no frustration, no friction, just like easily solvable everything, people will fucking love it."
- "Yes, it is one of my conditions that it fits on a normal N64 cartridge. I'm not gonna go above 64 megabytes."
- "I unfortunately cannot monetize this I have to release it for free or I will get murdered"

## Potential Interview Topics
- The evolution of Kaze's game design philosophy from early ROM hacks to this accessibility-focused approach
- The technical and creative challenges of authentic N64 development in the modern era
- Managing distributed creative collaboration across different time zones and payment systems
- The tension between fan creativity and intellectual property law in game development
- The role of live streaming and community feedback in shaping the development process
