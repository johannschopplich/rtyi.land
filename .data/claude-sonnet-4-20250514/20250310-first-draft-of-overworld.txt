## Game Development Process
- Working on overworld design for "Return to Yoshi's Island," specifically parts 2-3 of the first overworld out of 15 total parts
- The game is a ROM hack based on Mario 64 decompilation with extensive engine modifications
- Development involves iterative reworking of levels and areas that have already been redone once to "make them less bad"
- Current focus on implementing fog effects for a ghost ship level and designing natural barriers for overworld navigation
- Plans include a future "VFX pass" for the entire game to add visual effects

## Personal Insights
- Kaze expresses concern about his brain becoming "optimized" for specific tasks but losing versatility: "Sometimes I feel like I'm getting older and my brain doesn't work like it used to anymore... maybe my neurons just got more optimized and less variable"
- Strong passion for the project, working on his day off: "this one here is not any paid work at all this is just me working because of passion so it needs to be free too"
- Perfectionist approach to technical implementation, frustrated by software limitations and performance issues
- Believes in design philosophy that "sometimes the part that people least like about the game are also the parts that are most necessary to make the game's design work"

## Collaborator Information
- Biobank: Graphics artist responsible for reworking overworld areas and levels. Mentioned as actively working on visual improvements: "Biobank is going to rework all levels here"
- Zeina: Animator working on the project, mentioned in context of animations
- Other Contributors: Rob (working on converting materials), Mushi (working on Mario 64 Madness remake), Rovard and Voicel (beta testers for other projects)
- Community involvement through beta testing, with preference for longtime community members to minimize leak risk

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Struggling with creating natural environmental barriers instead of relying on cliffs: "it's so lame if everything's just cliffed up, right?"
- Implementing complex fog effects that respond to player distance and viewing angle around a ghost ship
- Designing interconnected overworld areas with specific unlock sequences (ice cap, lighthouse mechanics)
- Balancing accessibility for players who may not understand advanced techniques like wallkicks
- Extensive engine customization: "The only really thing that's still left from the vanilla 64 is Mario's physics"
- Working within N64 hardware limitations while implementing modern game design concepts

## Business Aspects
- Project is passion-driven and will be released for free, contrasting with commissioned projects
- Acknowledges "there's a lot of money to be made in romhacking" but emphasizes this project is not commercial
- Careful beta testing approach starting with trusted community members to prevent leaks
- Mentions other commissioned projects like "Drug Boss Mario 64" as separate commercial work

## Key Quotes
- "The only really thing that's still left from the vanilla 64 is Mario's physics. A little bit of the sound engine... really it's just mario mario's collision function are custom code"
- "I think 98% of games have at least one thing in them that costs like an unreasonable amount of performance and that's usually like the reason games lag"
- "this one here is not any paid work at all this is just me working because of passion so it needs to be free too"

## Potential Interview Topics
- The technical journey of rebuilding Mario 64's engine while maintaining the original feel
- Collaborative workflow with Biobank and other artists in the ROM hacking community
- Design philosophy around balancing player accessibility with advanced mechanics
- The distinction between passion projects and commercial ROM hacking work
- Community feedback integration and the role of live streaming in development
