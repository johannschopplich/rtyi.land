## Game Development Process
- Currently working on a cowboy-themed saloon/milk bar level with interactive NPCs and secret rooms
- Multiple levels in various stages of development (courses 13-15 and side levels mentioned)
- Considering reworking existing content, specifically course 2 (Divine Dino Domain) to add more platforming sections
- Using Mario 64 decompilation as the base, working within original N64 hardware constraints
- Level design process involves room layout planning, texture application, and camera consideration for playability

## Personal Insights
- Views creativity as fundamental to human existence: "What would be the point of an existence where you don't create? That's like the whole purpose of the human soul"
- Skeptical of rigid theoretical frameworks, preferring practical application over traditional color theory and music theory
- Embraces AI tools as development aids while maintaining that developers must still have core skills
- Values innovation within constraints rather than expanding beyond original hardware limitations
- Believes in open-source philosophy for ROM hacking community

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub (Barduke)**: Composer creating the game's soundtrack, consistently produces "bangers" according to community, Kaze plans to compensate him financially if physical release proceeds
- **Biobak**: Graphics artist contributing advanced texture techniques including "window technique" and combiner effects, creates textures frequently used throughout the project
- **Zeina**: Animator working on character animations, particularly dry bones animations, active community member and frequent stream participant
- **Other Contributors**: Cozys (created MiniOMG property exporter plugin), various community members offering assets like cactus models, XPM (texture contributor)

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Implementing cowboy-themed saloon with milk bar concept and secret "chalky milk" room for narrative depth
- Creating lore-integrated gameplay mechanics where Dry Bones enemies are harder to defeat due to milk consumption backstory
- Designing interactive dialogue system with NPCs providing gameplay hints and world-building
- Balancing polygon count constraints while maintaining visual quality on original N64 hardware
- Addressing level themes that feel "uninspired" compared to previous work, seeking dream-inspired concepts for future levels
- Implementing hidden doors and secret areas activated through environmental interaction

## Business Aspects
- Exploring physical cartridge release for soundtrack using new N64 decompression technology, potentially priced around $100
- Plans include custom box, instruction booklet, and flash drive with BPS files for ROM loading
- Merchandise development through Pixel Empire including themed stickers
- Commitment to financially compensating contributors, particularly Badub for soundtrack work
- Maintains free availability of base ROM while offering premium physical collectibles

## Key Quotes
- "What would be the point of an existence where you don't create? That's like the whole purpose of the human soul. And you're gonna go without it?"
- "I'm definitely gonna pay Barduke for the OST if we do end up making that cartridge... I would like to pay a lot of artists that help with this game"
- "I'm thinking maybe it would be cool if we made a cartridge with all the RTYI songs and sold that separately... we're gonna sell it for like a hundred dollars or something with a box and like a custom cartridge and like an instruction booklet"

## Potential Interview Topics
- The creative process behind level theme development and how dreams/inspiration translate to game design
- Collaboration dynamics with remote contributors and community-driven development approach
- Technical philosophy of working within original N64 constraints versus modern enhancement
- Business model innovation for ROM hack monetization while respecting open-source principles
- Integration of narrative elements and world-building into traditional Mario 64 gameplay mechanics
