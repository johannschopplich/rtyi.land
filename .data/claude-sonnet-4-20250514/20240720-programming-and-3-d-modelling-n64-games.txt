## Game Development Process
- The game is well into development with multiple courses completed, currently working on Course 13 and optimizing Oily Boily Bay assets
- Major performance optimization achievements including 400 microseconds of computing time improvement through memory allocation fixes
- Team successfully targeting 30 FPS performance with asset optimization and reduced polygon counts
- Profiling reveals the game spends 76% of CPU time idle, indicating efficient resource usage
- Development timeline appears reasonable given the small team size, with Kaze noting "For just so few people making a whole game. I think RTVI is being made in pretty reasonable amount of time"

## Personal Insights
- Kaze is expecting his first child (daughter named Reyna) and plans to use his 2-month paternity leave for N64 optimization work
- He has strong technical perfectionism, constantly analyzing performance metrics and optimization opportunities
- Recently moved out of Germany due to dissatisfaction with the country's technological infrastructure and bureaucracy
- Has hired a video editor for his content creation, indicating growth in his media presence
- Maintains a critical perspective on internet culture while engaging with his streaming audience

## Collaborator Information
- **Biobank**: Primary graphics artist providing extensive asset updates including optimized character models, textures, and environmental assets. Contributed significant polygon and material count reductions while improving visual quality
- **Sauron**: Technical collaborator who developed the profiler/tracer tool that Kaze is using for performance analysis
- **Zeina**: Kaze's partner working on animations, currently expecting their first child together
- **Badub**: No relevant information found in this transcript
- **Other Contributors**: Unnamed video editor working on Kaze's content creation

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Implemented 8x more precise control angles (65,536 vs 4,096 in original Mario 64) improving gameplay responsiveness
- Solved critical memory allocation issues that caused crashes due to collision triangle complexity in large environments
- Balanced visual quality with performance constraints through strategic material reduction and fog implementation
- Redesigned character models to reduce bone counts and material usage while maintaining visual appeal
- Addressed collision detection challenges where large surfaces crossing multiple cells required excessive surface node allocation

## Business Aspects
- No relevant information found regarding marketing, funding, or distribution plans

## Key Quotes
- "Funny thing about RTYI, 25 out of 33 milliseconds are spent on a while 1 loop. It's all idle. It's around 76% of the entire game, it's just the game doing nothing at all."
- "When I first made this slide I ran out of memory. And because of that I did the whole memory allocation thing that I talked about earlier in my Case Clips video today. And because of that we gained 400 microseconds of computing time."
- "In Mario 64 you have 4096 angles. In this game you have 65336 angles. The controls are about 8 times more precise."

## Potential Interview Topics
