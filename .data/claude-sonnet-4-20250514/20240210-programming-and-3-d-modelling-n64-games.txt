## Game Development Process
- Project is approximately 80% complete with "three more main courses and two side levels and one bowser level" remaining
- Major technical milestone achieved: completely replaced Mario 64's collision system with custom implementation that provides much more stable physics
- Currently working on boss fight mechanics in a western/cowboy themed level featuring Monty Moles
- Development follows a star-based progression system with multiple objectives per level
- Stream represents active development with real-time problem-solving and iterative design

## Personal Insights
- Kaze acknowledges that while some parts of his code are more readable than the original decompilation, "in most places I made it much worse"
- Philosophy on bug preservation: "If there's a bug in Mario 64 that you only encounter if you do it on purpose, I'll leave it in the game. But if it can happen on accident, I'll remove it"
- Approach to criticism: "When I receive a criticism, I try to figure out like what the person was feeling that's wrong... I think about what they were feeling and seeing if I can address their feeling instead of their actual critique"
- Views the project as both a technical challenge and creative expression, balancing nostalgia with innovation

- Zeina: Limited mention - appears to also be referred to as "Lila" in the transcript, with references to unfinished quaternion animations work
- Other Contributors: No additional specific contributors mentioned beyond brief community interactions in chat

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Boss fight design involves iterative brainstorming: considered various mechanics for Monty Mole boss including survival waves, multiple targets, and random hole switching
- Physics implementation uses calculated trajectory math rather than predictive targeting: "It shoots exactly where Mario is at. It's not predictive"
- Intentional preservation of certain speedrunning techniques like BLJ (Backwards Long Jump) while fixing collision issues
- Balance between accessibility and maintaining core Mario 64 feel through design choices
- Focus on western/cowboy theming for current level with appropriate enemy types and aesthetics

## Business Aspects
- Plans to launch a Kickstarter for an original game project alongside the release of Return to Yoshi's Island
- Intends to transition from ROM hacking to original game development and potentially hire other ROM hackers
- Has established sponsorship rates for his content creation (mentions $1000-1500 for end-video ads, $5000+ for pre-video)
- Views the project as a stepping stone to larger commercial game development opportunities

## Key Quotes
- "I made a completely new collision system. I said, fuck Mario 64's collision. It is unusable. We have our completely own collision system now. And it's so much more stable."
- "When I receive a criticism, I try to figure out like what the person was feeling that's wrong, right? I don't really think about what they're saying as much as I think about what they were feeling"
- "I'm planning like alongside the release of return to your silent I'll probably launch like a Kickstarter for my own game and then transition to working on that and then hopefully I can hire some other rom hackers to work on it with me"

## Potential Interview Topics
- The decision-making process behind completely replacing Mario 64's collision system and the technical challenges involved

- The transition from ROM hacking to original game development and plans for building a development team
- Community engagement through live streaming development and how viewer feedback influences design decisions
- The balance between technical innovation and maintaining the nostalgic feel of classic Mario games
