## Game Development Process
- Game is approximately 80% complete as mentioned during the stream
- Currently working on a complex boss fight with Raphael Raven on the moon, involving planetary gravity mechanics and coordinate system transformations
- Planning 15 total courses with course 13 being worked on during the stream
- Hub world designed as Yoshi's Island with a coin-based progression system where players can unlock bridges, trees, and other environmental changes
- ROM size is currently 62.6 MB, with 50.6 MB dedicated to streamed music, demonstrating the audio-heavy nature of the project
- Technical challenges include implementing non-Euclidean geometry, planetary gravity systems, and complex cutscene transitions

## Personal Insights
- Kaze expresses significant frustration with community pressure regarding release dates: "You know what the most fucked up part about being a famous romaker is? When people harass me about the release date and I tell them that I want the whole family to... I am the bad guy."
- Struggles with difficulty balancing and polarized community feedback: "the comments I get on my YouTube is either like, oh wow, this level looks way too easy, or oh wow, this level looks way too hard. No one ever says Kaze, the difficulty of this looks perfect to me."
- Works full-time as a programmer in video game development, indicating this is a passion project outside his professional work
- Experiences "mental pain because of bureaucracy" but remains committed to the technical and creative challenges
- Plans to create more educational content about N64 programming to support his family financially

## Collaborator Information
- Zeina: Animator working on character animations for the game, specifically mentioned as currently working on animations needed for the Raven boss fight
- Biobak: Graphics artist contributing to visual effects and backgrounds, with Kaze expressing excitement about potential rotating background effects during the boss fight
- Okayo: Video editor hired by Kaze to edit promotional videos, representing a shift toward more professional content creation
- Other Contributors: An unnamed team member who worked on enemy mechanics, specifically changing enemy movement from velocities to turn speeds

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Implemented dynamic difficulty scaling where boss fights become easier over time rather than scaling with player health to avoid "leveling makes no sense" scenarios
- Boss mechanics include the Raven scaling up when hit (making it easier to target) while simultaneously speeding up and spawning more attacks
- Chose to maintain Yoshi's Island's visual and audio identity while leveraging Mario 64's decompiled engine for technical capabilities
- Developed innovative planetary gravity system that required complex mathematical solutions for object positioning and camera work
- Struggled with transportation mechanics after boss fights, ultimately deciding to spawn the star directly on the moon rather than implementing complex return mechanisms

## Business Aspects
- Plans to increase video production for financial reasons: "I'm thinking I will just pump out a lot of videos. Stuff like how does the BLG in R64 work? Or how do the paintings work?"
- Hired professional video editor to improve content quality and production efficiency
- Considers educational content about N64 programming techniques as potentially high-viewership material
- No specific monetization strategy for the game itself mentioned, focusing on content creation for revenue

## Key Quotes
- "You know what the most fucked up part about being a famous romaker is? When people harass me about the release date and I tell them that I want the whole family to... I am the bad guy."
- "the comments I get on my YouTube is either like, oh wow, this level looks way too easy, or oh wow, this level looks way too hard. No one ever says Kaze, the difficulty of this looks perfect to me."
- "This is Yoshi's Island. This is very clearly a Yoshi's Island boss fight. Think of Mario Galaxy wrong."
