## Game Development Process
- Game is substantially complete with Course 12 out of 15 levels shown, indicating the project is in late development stages
- Currently focused on performance optimization, working with microcode developer Soren to implement F3DEX3 for better graphics performance
- Each level features "retro pipes" - references to classic games that came out before the N64 lifecycle ended
- Technical optimization is ongoing, with detailed performance analysis and troubleshooting being conducted
- Various gameplay mechanics are being refined, including timer-based challenges (40-45 second races) and interactive elements like moving trains

## Personal Insights
- Kaze prioritizes emulator compatibility over advanced features: "I want to make sure it runs fine on emulators. So I stick to just my F3DX2"
- Shows frustration with technical challenges but maintains focus on core Mario 64 movement: "We want the fun to be for Mario's movement and not just random things like that"
- Expresses philosophy against gimmicky additions: "It kind of feels like, oh, you like Mario 64. Well, fuck you. Here's Mario Kart. I don't want that"
- Demonstrates technical perfectionism, spending significant time on performance optimization details

- Biobak: No relevant information found in this transcript  
- Zeina: No relevant information found in this transcript
- Other Contributors: 
  - Soren: Primary collaborator in this stream, developer of F3DEX3 microcode, Seq64 tool, and Triforce% demonstration. Also works on N64 music arranging
  - Arthur: Contributes creative ideas, suggested the Mario 64 retro pipe concept
  - Unnamed animator: Someone offered to do animations in 2021 but failed to deliver: "Someone offered to do the animations in 2021 and they kept saying I'll do it, I'll do it, I'll do it and then they didn't do it. And that's why you don't do call-ups"

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Technical challenge of implementing F3DEX3 microcode for performance improvements while maintaining compatibility
- Design decision to use vertex coloring instead of complex lighting: "my entire world is vertex color" and "I just fake them via vertex colors. So I just run them on a CPU"
- Creative concept of retro pipes referencing games from before N64 era in each level
- Planned cowboy-themed level featuring a shootout with Yoshi character
- Mario Kart-themed desert level with functional train mechanics and racing elements
- Performance optimization challenges requiring detailed technical analysis of rendering pipeline

## Business Aspects
- Concerns about unauthorized ROM hack sales: witnessed his work being sold for $50 at MagFest convention without permission
- Awareness of online stores making "millions" selling ROM hack reproductions: "I also saw online stores that had like a hundred thousand sales of like people's romhacks they literally made millions"
- No direct monetization plans mentioned, appears to be passion project
- Community-driven development with input from various contributors

## Key Quotes
- "We want the fun to be for Mario's movement and not just random things like that. It kind of feels like, oh, you like Mario 64. Well, fuck you. Here's Mario Kart. I don't want that."
- "Someone offered to do the animations in 2021 and they kept saying I'll do it, I'll do it, I'll do it and then they didn't do it. And that's why you don't do call-ups."
- "I think everybody in the community is really pumped about RTYI and I'm looking forward to playing myself. I hope I don't disappoint." (Soren's comment about community anticipation)

## Potential Interview Topics
- The philosophy behind the "retro pipes" concept and how it connects different gaming eras
- The challenges of managing community contributors and the disappointment with unreliable collaborators
- The technical decision-making process between innovation and compatibility (F3DEX3 vs maintaining emulator support)
- The unauthorized distribution problem facing ROM hack creators and its impact on the community
- The balance between respecting Mario 64's core gameplay while adding new creative elements
