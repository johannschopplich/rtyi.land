## Game Development Process
- Currently working on Course 15 (Astro Arcade), described as "the final main course" with "still a couple side levels to do" after completion
- Planning a demo release featuring Course 1 and Delfino Plaza with "maybe like eight red coins or something just to like flex"
- Overall completion estimated at approximately 90-91% with "all the MPs imported now, so we have enough room space for sure"
- Conducting beta testing with multiple players to identify design issues and improve player experience
- Developing overworld systems and implementing new control schemes that testers found "great"
- Technical progress being hampered by Fast64 export bugs affecting level development workflow

## Personal Insights
- Kaze emphasizes the importance of clear player guidance, noting "I think that's why all the Mario 64 levels are designed the way they are. They have a very clear forward. That gets you through like 80% of the level"
- Expresses pride in recent work: "I just finished the next video. It's 14 minutes long and it's a banger. I think this is the best video on my channel yet"
- Shows philosophical approach to level design where players should "feel like you know where to go next" and make "mental notes on what else there is to level"
- Demonstrates iterative mindset, willing to redesign elements based on testing feedback
- Reveals concern about Nintendo copyright issues affecting release strategy

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: Composer working on the project's soundtrack, with community members asking about "media files for these unused sound effects" to play on flute
- Biobak: Graphics artist providing concept work and visual assets, specifically mentioned in context of sending concepts for level design elements
- Zeina: Animator present during the stream (briefly appeared to pick up a baby), working on character animations that have been significantly improved since the demo
- Other Contributors: Multiple beta testers providing crucial feedback, someone who created "knife models" for the project, and community members offering texture and design suggestions

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Major player guidance issues discovered through beta testing of Course 3, where "one person had a really miserable experience" due to unclear navigation and difficulty spikes
- Implementing pinball mechanics including "flipper pieces," "spherical bumpers," "triangle pieces that bump you in the direction that it points at," and "trampoline pieces"
- Struggling with inconsistent void protection mechanics across levels, with some levels featuring safety nets while others result in instant death
- Technical challenges with Fast64 bugs preventing proper level exports: "this fast 64 bug actually makes it so that we can't export the level correctly"
- Balancing accessibility while maintaining challenge, particularly regarding the placement and difficulty of 8-bit pipe sections

## Business Aspects
- Significant concern about Nintendo copyright enforcement: "With the release trailer, I want to be very careful, because I feel like Nintendo is going to try to take that down. So I really, really need to make sure it's fair use"
- Cannot produce physical cartridges due to legal concerns: "Well, I can't make physical cartridges because Nintendo will literally murder me and take everything I own. Unless I move to China, then I could probably do it"
- Planning strategic release timing to avoid conflicts with Nintendo releases
- Considering fair use protections for promotional materials while acknowledging Nintendo's aggressive takedown history

## Key Quotes
- "I think that's why all the Mario 64 levels are designed the way they are. They have a very clear forward. That gets you through like 80% of the level. And it gets your foot in the door. So you feel like you know where to go next."
- "I think the overall conclusion is the player really needs to be guided to Star 1 a lot more. I think this is something they do in Mario 64 a lot, where they make it very obvious how to get to the first star, and then on the way to the first star you make a bunch of mental notes on what else there is to level and what you want to explore."
- "With the release trailer, I want to be very careful, because I feel like Nintendo is going to try to take that down. So I really, really need to make sure it's fair use, which I'm not sure how to do yet."
