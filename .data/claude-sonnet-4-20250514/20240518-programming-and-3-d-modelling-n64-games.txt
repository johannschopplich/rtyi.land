## Game Development Process
- Project is approximately 80% complete with "3 out of 5 areas done. The factories and say no, only the office and boss area to go. Okay. And those are the smallest areas. So, that sounds pretty promising."
- Currently working on course 13 (ice castle level), focusing on greyboxing and implementing platforming mechanics
- Development involves creating 3D models for platforming pieces and refining gameplay mechanics
- Stream focused on technical implementation of ice platforms with cracking and breaking animations
- Built on Mario 64 decompilation, allowing for advanced shader work and custom mechanics

## Personal Insights
- Kaze has a pragmatic approach to bug fixing: "I don't go bug fixing until like the very end sometimes bugs just randomly get fixed like that"
- Demonstrates analytical thinking in everyday situations (calculating toilet paper efficiency), reflecting his methodical approach to game development
- Expresses strong opinions about game design, particularly criticizing Mario 64 DS for forced character switching mechanics
- Shows perfectionist tendencies, spending significant time refining visual effects until satisfied with results
- Balancing game development with impending fatherhood, affecting participation in events like F3

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: Composer responsible for the game's soundtrack, with plans to upload the full OST mentioned
- Biobak: Graphics artist providing visual assets and technical suggestions, particularly for ice effects and textures shared via Discord
- Zeina: Kaze's wife who handles animations and has developed "special plans for the video" with a documentary approach to the release
- Other Contributors: Eiza mentioned as having special video/documentary plans; active community providing real-time feedback and suggestions during development streams

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Implementing ice platforms that "crack on the first jump and break on the second" with visual particle effects
- Designing appearing ice paths similar to Mario Galaxy's light bridge mechanic
- Creating spinning ice shards for unique platforming challenges
- Technical challenges with material shaders, texture work, and particle systems within N64 hardware limitations
- Balancing visual fidelity with performance constraints of the original Mario 64 engine

## Business Aspects
- Documentary-style release video planned by Zeina: "Eiza wanted it to make like a little bit of a documentary thing almost"
- Plans to release full soundtrack as a playlist
- Mario Builder project releasing concurrently 
- Uncertainty about participating in F3 event due to personal circumstances (impending child birth)
- No traditional marketing or funding discussions mentioned

## Key Quotes
- "Eiza had like a special plan for the video. So, let's see how that goes. Eiza wanted it to make like a little bit of a documentary thing almost."
- "I don't go bug fixing until like the very end sometimes bugs just randomly get fixed like that"
- "3 out of 5 areas done. The factories and say no, only the office and boss area to go. Okay. And those are the smallest areas. So, that sounds pretty promising."

## Potential Interview Topics
- The collaborative decision to create a documentary-style release video and what story they want to tell about the development process
- How the team balances technical innovation within the constraints of the Mario 64 engine
- The creative partnership between Kaze, Zeina, Biobak, and Badub, and how their different specialties contribute to the final product
- The impact of personal life changes (becoming parents) on indie game development timelines and priorities
- The philosophy behind ROM hacking as an art form and the technical/creative challenges it presents
