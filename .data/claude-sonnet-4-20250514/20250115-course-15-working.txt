## Game Development Process
- The game is in an advanced development stage with platforming completed for at least one level: "for SA2B we got the platforming for the first star done we're still working on the visuals right now I'm trying to like get all the platforming done and then afterwards maybe polish up the visuals a little bit"
- Most core development is complete but some dependencies remain: "there is still some stuff that I couldn't finish for the earlier levels yet because there was something else I have to wait on first but generally speaking it's like most most of everything is done"
- Current focus is on visual polish and promotional content, including a 45-minute YouTube video about the development process
- Active development streams show real-time iteration on level design, particularly working on a space city level with concert hall and space taxi elements

## Personal Insights
- Kaze expresses complex feelings about solo development and budget constraints: "I hate when people look at my stuff. And they're like it's impressive. And then someone else always says. Oh but he has no budget. And he works alone. And I'm just like. I have no budget. And I work alone. Isn't that like making me look bad?"
- Shows philosophical approach to game design: "The gameplay is more linear but the feeling is hopefully not more linear that makes sense I Think that's key the key to modern game design you want to make something that is linear, but isn't it?"
- Demonstrates perfectionist tendencies and technical focus, spending significant time on shader work and visual effects
- Reveals ambivalent relationship with community feedback and criticism

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub**: Composer for the project. "Yeah Badoob is doing the music. I can't do music at all."
- **Biobak**: Graphics artist who polishes models and contributes creative ideas. "Biobank goes over my models. After I'm done. And polishes them up. Brings a lot of ideas. And new concepts to the table." Kaze acknowledges unfair compensation due to limited ROM hacking income.
- **Zeina**: Created character models including Peach and Toad, with plans to handle animations. "You made this Peach by the way, if you don't remember, I think you also wanted to do the animation so I left that for you"
- **Other Contributors**: Dory (working on separate "compact" project), Alexado (interested in PC port), and a paid editor for YouTube content ($500 from $940 monthly YouTube revenue)

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Implemented narrative-driven level progression: "there's a lot of story to the level. Where in the first act you can't really get anywhere, because all the shy guys in this level are scared and they're hiding in their houses. And then during the second act, after you beat the boss, the shy guys are out and they're gonna drive these cars here"
- Focus on creating linear gameplay that doesn't feel restrictive to players
- Extensive technical work on custom shaders, lighting systems, and visual effects for N64 hardware limitations
- Balancing aesthetic consistency across different level themes while maintaining the original Mario 64 feel

## Business Aspects
- Monthly YouTube revenue of $940 with $500 going to editor, leaving $400 plus Patreon as primary income: "We made $940. I had to pay my editor like $500. It's $400. I mean, that's kinda like a side job, right? Plus, of course, Patreon. That's the majority of my income."
- Acknowledges financial constraints in ROM hacking: "There's just not really much money in role making"
- Resistance to PC port requests despite community interest: "If I had the ability to just like slip my fingers and the PC port would be out of existence, I would do it"
- Operates as part-time work alongside programming job that started in 2022

## Key Quotes
- "I think that's key the key to modern game design you want to make something that is linear, but isn't it?" - On balancing structure with player freedom
- "I have no budget. And I work alone. Isn't that like making me look bad? Making my life more difficult. I feel like if I had money to pay people. Then I would have a better shot at being a good gamer." - On solo development challenges
- "my videos have kind of turned into computer science lectures in disguise. Haven't they? They used to be much more just Mario. And now they're so complicated." - On evolution of content and technical complexity

## Potential Interview Topics
- The creative vision behind integrating narrative elements (shy guys hiding/emerging) into traditional Mario 64 level design and how this reflects broader design philosophy
- The collaborative process with remote team members and how roles evolved organically, particularly the relationship between technical and artistic contributions
- The financial realities of ROM hacking as a creative medium and how budget constraints shape both creative and business decisions
- Technical innovations required to implement modern game design concepts within N64 hardware limitations and decompiled Mario 64 codebase
- Community management and balancing fan requests (like PC ports) with creative vision and practical limitations
