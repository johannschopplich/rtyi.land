## Game Development Process
- The game is titled "Return to Yoshi's Island" and is a ROM hack based on Mario 64 decompilation
- Currently working on course 15 (the factory/boss area), with a demo available containing only course 1-1 for physics and camera feedback
- Targeting 30 FPS performance and requires N64 expansion pack to run
- Development involves live streaming work sessions where community provides real-time feedback
- Survey feedback from the demo was described as "very useful" and "a banger idea"

## Personal Insights
- Kaze expresses frustration with graphics work, particularly lighting and reflection effects: "I think the whole concept is shit that I have right now"
- He's concerned about his streaming channel becoming too public: "it's like too private for the public you know that's how it feels like i thought this was just gonna be my stream chat but now my stream chat's giant"
- Strong resistance to PC port pressure due to community persistence: "People have been so insistent and annoying about the PC port. That at this point, out of pure stubbornness, I want nothing to do with it"
- Primary motivation is creative rather than financial: "I just want to make a cool N64 game"
- Maintains strict design philosophy about preserving Mario 64 physics

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: No relevant information found in this transcript
- Biobak: Working closely with Kaze on boss fight design: "me and biobank we have been talking about a little bit the boss fight is basically the thing we have to like do next or plan out next"
- Zeina: No relevant information found in this transcript
- Other Contributors: 
  - **Dario**: Created visual effects that Kaze admires and references for his own work
  - **Asa**: Contributed texture work that significantly improved the visual quality: "asa's texture actually made it look good"
  - **Alox**: Mentioned in relation to potential X-Corp collaboration work

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Major boss fight design evolution from violent "space squid with tentacles" to healing-based "mutated yoshi" encounter
- Core design principle: "one important ground rule for this is that most of the time you will stay mario end up with the same physics that's important for me"
- Boss fight philosophy shifted to healing rather than destruction: "what if you just destroy the tumors and that like makes him happy and he's like wow, thanks for helping me"
- Technical challenges with lighting, reflections, and maintaining frame rate performance
- Balancing visual quality with technical limitations of N64 hardware

## Business Aspects
- Acknowledges potential financial benefits of PC port development but prioritizes creative vision over profit
- Expresses interest in potential Nintendo collaboration: "I probably would want to do that. That sounds fun"
- Development appears to be passion-driven rather than commercially motivated
- No specific mention of funding sources or release/distribution plans

## Key Quotes
- "I just want to make a cool N64 game" - encapsulates his core creative motivation
- "one important ground rule for this is that most of the time you will stay mario end up with the same physics that's important for me" - reveals fundamental design philosophy
- "what if you just destroy the tumors and that like makes him happy and he's like wow, thanks for helping me" - demonstrates evolution toward non-violent, healing-based gameplay mechanics

## Potential Interview Topics
