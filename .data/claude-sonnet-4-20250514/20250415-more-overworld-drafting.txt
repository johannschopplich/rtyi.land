## Game Development Process
- First draft of all 15 levels completed, currently working on overworld drafting and planning secret stars/events
- Currently have 177-180 stars planned with consideration to expand to 200 for a "nice round number"
- Beta testing completed for Course 3 and Course 11, with plans to beta test all levels before release
- Major remaining work includes: overworld completion, sound engine refactoring, operating system improvements, beta testing feedback implementation, waiting for Biobak's level reworks, side levels, and bug fixes
- Game designed as open world with no visible loading zones, targeting constant 30 FPS on real N64 hardware
- Project scope firmly defined as 15 levels plus overworld, never changed from original vision

## Personal Insights
- Kaze has been working on ROM hacks for 12 years and expresses frustration with Mario 64's legacy code, particularly the audio system
- Views video content creation as "necessary evil" for monetization and paying collaborators, though he doesn't enjoy it
- Shows confidence regarding potential Nintendo takedowns based on 12 years of experience (only had one project permanently taken down)
- Demonstrates strong game design philosophy, preferring focused scope over feature creep
- Expresses genuine passion for the technical aspects while finding the business side burdensome

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub (Composer)**: Created nearly 20 overworld songs designed to seamlessly transition into each other as "RTYI overworld pack," also produced ambient sound effects including rain, seagulls, jungle sounds, and ocean waves for directional audio placement
- **Biobak (Graphics Artist)**: Working on level reworks that must be completed before release, responsible for visual improvements across multiple courses
- **Zeina (Animator)**: Working on Course 13 with detailed animation work, contributing significant detail to level completion
- **Other Contributors**: Editor for video content, sponsors for funding, active beta testing community, and various community members providing feedback

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Major technical challenge refactoring Mario 64's audio engine, which Kaze describes as "fucked" and "clearly written by like five different guys that completely forgot what the other three guys were writing"
- Implementing seamless music transitions between overworld areas using mix of streamed and sequenced audio
- Designing character development arcs (such as Boshi's evolution from edgy loner to friend)
- Balancing performance optimization with visual ambition (targeting 50,000 polygons for entire overworld)
- Creating meaningful overworld events that leave permanent changes to maintain sense of progression
- Rejecting day/night cycles due to technical complexity and lack of gameplay purpose

## Business Aspects
- Revenue model based on YouTube content creation with editor and sponsors
- Uses profits to pay collaborators and fund development
- Experienced with Nintendo takedown concerns but confident based on track record (70 videos taken down but most restored)
- Considers potential legal strategy of removing Nintendo assets and releasing as independent game if needed
- Plans video content around development milestones to maintain audience engagement

## Key Quotes
- "I used to think the audio code in Mario 64 was like the most competent part of the game, but after reading basically all of it, I gotta say, like this is dogshit, it was clearly written by like five different guys that completely forgot what the other three guys were writing."
- "It was always going to be 15 levels, it's never changed from that. I've never had the issue of just keeping adding things."
- "Personally, I don't like having to make videos. But it is the only way I can make any profit out of this. And pay the people that help me."
