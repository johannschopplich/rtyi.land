## Game Development Process
- Currently working on Course 11, which underwent a major theme change from volcano to oil rig setting
- Game is tentatively titled "Return to Yoshi's Island 64" but concerns about searchability may lead to name changes
- End cutscenes are pending completion of animations from collaborator Zeina
- Multi-language support is planned and likely to be implemented
- Video content creation alongside development (recently finished video about Mario's movement mechanics)

## Personal Insights
- Kaze expresses feeling "less free in video games" and describes a methodical, almost mechanical approach to playing modern games: "if I boot up Mario Odyssey, I know to just like enter the level and like... follow the right wall until I've been everywhere in the level"
- Strong philosophy on design problem-solving: "designing something is not just about coming up with ideas it's about solving whatever problem you have in design"
- Selective approach to community feedback: "I don't want random ideas, guys... the probability of me actually putting any of them in is very slim"
- Personal life integration: mentions going outside with Zeina to make a terrarium, showing work-life balance

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: No specific information found in this transcript
- Biobak: No specific information found in this transcript  
- Zeina: Responsible for animations, particularly for end cutscenes. Kaze mentions waiting for their work to complete certain aspects. Also appears to be personally close to Kaze (mentioned making terrarium together)
- Other Contributors: Rionu (translator described as persistent about translating the game), Nata (provided textures), various community members providing feedback and suggestions

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Major thematic shift for Course 11 from volcano to oil rig: "now that we switch to the oil rig theming we need some new platform ideas this is going to be a bit difficult to pull off"
- Complex multi-mission level structure with narrative elements, including Mission 2 where "they are on a strike and you operate a crane to break a big Bowser statue"
- Technical polygon count limitations: "this level is going to be very high poly. This level is going to absolutely murder the triangles"
- Balancing visual appeal with platforming functionality in mountain/spire design
- Integration of thematic elements (oil rig workers, airship landing pads, industrial machinery) with Mario gameplay mechanics

## Business Aspects
- Concern about game title searchability: "it might not be the most searchable name"
- Awareness of competitive release timing, noting another developer's "dangerous marketing wise" decision to release shortly after a major Nintendo game
- Recognition of Nintendo's enforcement patterns: "nintendo also has a habit of going after romex right after they release their own games"
- No specific funding or distribution plans mentioned

## Key Quotes
- "designing something is not just about coming up with ideas it's about solving whatever problem you have in design" - Shows Kaze's methodical approach to game development

- "this level is going to be very high poly. This level is going to absolutely murder the triangles" - Demonstrates awareness of technical constraints in ROM hack development

## Potential Interview Topics
