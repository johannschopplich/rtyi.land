## Game Development Process
- Achieved significant 10-15% performance improvement since last stream, calling it "crazy" progress at this stage of development
- Currently working on Course 11 (power plant level) with detailed level design including weight platforms, treadmills, and collapsing grates
- Has multiple courses planned, with Wild West level next and courses 13-15 not yet finalized
- All music in the game is custom, not reusing other games' music
- Development pace limited by full-time job commitments
- Factory level (bomb cap course) being completely reworked by collaborator

## Personal Insights
- Recently moved to a new house and now works in the basement, experiencing setup-related neck pain
- Strongly opposed to giving release date guarantees: "this releases when it gets done"
- Frustrated with community pressure about release timing
- Has philosophical approach to game design: "I just want to make the funny Mario" rather than sending messages
- Values responsive game mechanics and performance optimization
- Maintains work-life balance by limiting development time due to full-time employment

## Collaborator Information
- Biobak/Biomech: Graphics artist working on textures and visual elements for power plant level, providing suggestions for platform mechanics
- Mata/Nata: Commissioned to rework factory level, originally estimated 2 weeks but now 4 months overtime, low confidence in completion
- Yoshi Milkman: Sound designer creating new sounds for Mario 64 to improve immersion
- Zeina: Partner/spouse who "banished" Kaze to basement workspace
- Other Contributors: Dumpy (composer mentioned for potential future work), various community members providing design feedback

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Implemented innovative weight platform system where stepping on one platform affects the other's height
- Optimized coin rendering by converting from billboards to sprites, achieving significant performance gains
- Designed power plant level with progressive difficulty introduction of three platform types
- Created humorous union benefits storyline for Bowser's minions (5-minute lunch breaks, 8-hour Sunday shifts)
- Targeting vanilla Mario 64 difficulty level while accounting for improved controls
- Balancing responsive mechanics vs. visual polish (coin spinning behavior discussion)

## Business Aspects
- Maintains full-time job that limits development time and prevents release date commitments
- Paid commission to Mata for factory level rework
- No specific marketing or distribution plans discussed
- Tentatively mentioned "mid next year" but immediately retracted any timeline guarantees
- Emphasizes completion over deadlines

## Key Quotes
- "Since the last stream I made so many updates to this game. Oh, you guys have no idea. We found like a 10-15% performance improvement. At this stage, that is crazy."
- "Guys, this releases when it gets done. Like, literally just leave me alone. It's done when it's done. That's all you're gonna get."
- "I'm not trying to send a message at all, I just want to make the funny Mario."

## Potential Interview Topics
- The technical innovation behind the 10-15% performance improvement and coin sprite system optimization
