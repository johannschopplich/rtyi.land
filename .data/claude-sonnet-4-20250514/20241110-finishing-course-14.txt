## Game Development Process
- The project is very close to completion, with Kaze stating "We are so close" and "We are probably finishing this today" regarding Course 14
- Currently working on Course 14 (cardboard/handmade theme) which is nearly complete, just waiting for one animation asset from Yuki
- Planning and beginning work on Course 15 (arcade/space theme level called "Astral Arcade")
- ROM size is currently 58-62 megabytes, staying within their self-imposed 64MB limit to match original N64 cartridge constraints
- The game contains "three times as much text as Mario 64" and successfully runs on actual N64 hardware
- Uses expansion pack RAM for easier development rather than optimizing for the original 4MB memory limit

## Personal Insights
- Kaze maintains a strong philosophy about authentic limitations: "I want to stick to the 64 megabyte limit because that's what they worked with back in a day. So going over that would feel like cheating"
- Reflects on personal development challenges: "Me and words is weird because I used to be a really eloquent speaker... after I spent like four years not talking at all I became a lot worse at it"
- Expresses complex views on Nintendo's legal rights versus personal preferences regarding game streaming and copyright
- Shows perfectionist tendencies and strong design convictions, particularly against 2D sections and certain mini-game mechanics
- Discusses previous project 64 Land with detachment: "the anxiety of working on 64 Land is a blur in my memory... It's like someone else took possession of my body and made it"

## Collaborator Information
- **Yuki**: Animator working on character animations, specifically mentioned for Peach animations. Kaze is currently waiting for one asset from Yuki to complete Course 14
- **Badoob**: Music composer who has created songs for multiple levels including "Funky Space Casino" for Course 15. Usually provides looping points for audio implementation but wasn't consulted for the current track
- **Laira**: Artist who created "an adorable peach drawing" used in the game
- **Holly**: Contributor with music knowledge who was asked to help determine audio looping points during the stream
- **Zayna**: Mentioned at the beginning of the stream (possibly the same as "Zeina" referenced in the prompt)

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Strong design philosophy against 2D gameplay sections: "2D sections in the game doesn't work... It feels like the opposite of what the design of this game nears"
- Struggling with Course 15 design, wanting arcade themes without actual gambling mechanics: "I want them to be games and not gambling. That's kind of important to me"
- Technical challenge of implementing proper audio looping points for pre-rendered songs
- Balancing authentic N64 hardware limitations with modern development efficiency
- Creative challenge of naming stars and maintaining thematic consistency across levels
- Memory management decisions prioritizing development speed over optimization

## Business Aspects
- Twitter monetization is close to being achieved: "we are so close to getting monetized on Twitter"
- Discussed potential Nintendo employment, stating would need $110-120k salary to make it worthwhile due to giving up modding projects
- No clear monetization strategy mentioned for the ROM hack itself, consistent with the free distribution nature of ROM hacks

## Key Quotes
- "I want to stick to the 64 megabyte limit because that's what they worked with back in a day. So going over that would feel like cheating"
- "To me, the anxiety of working on 64 Land is a blur in my memory. I don't remember that I made that game. It's like someone else took possession of my body and made it"
- "We already have three times as much text as Mario 64"

## Potential Interview Topics
- The philosophy and challenges of maintaining authentic N64 hardware limitations in modern ROM hack development
- The collaborative workflow between Kaze and various artists/musicians, particularly the remote coordination process
- The evolution from previous projects like 64 Land to Return to Yoshi's Island and lessons learned
- Design philosophy regarding mini-games, 2D sections, and maintaining the core 3D platforming experience
- The technical aspects of ROM hacking versus traditional game development, including memory management and audio implementation
