## Game Development Process
- Working on level design and art direction for "Frantic Fleet Factory" (Course 11), described as a construction zone where Bowser's minions work
- Level comes after the second Bowser level where players destroy Bowser's fleet, creating narrative continuity as this is where the ships were originally built
- Multiple mission structure planned: Mission 1 (trolling minions), Mission 2 (minions striking), Mission 3 (Bowser sends boss to break strike), Mission 4 (power generator), Mission 5 (red coins)
- Significant technical challenges with polygon count optimization for N64 hardware limitations
- Currently in pre-production art direction phase, establishing visual style before building level geometry

## Personal Insights
- "I always find this to be the most interesting but also the hardest part of making a level and that is getting the start" - Kaze finds initial art direction most challenging
- "if you want to finish a March 64 major heck you need to be mentally ill. You cannot do it if you are not mentally ill. What kind of normal person would just make an entire heck like that for free" - Reflects on the intense dedication required for ROM hack development
- Values conciseness in communication: "Being concise is one of the most important skills in the world. Being concise is one of the skills I value the most"
- Demonstrates perfectionist tendencies and iterative design approach, constantly refining visual elements

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: No relevant information found in this transcript
- Biobak: Actively collaborates on level layouts and visual design, provides real-time input during development streams ("Biobank helps with the level layouts. Or the level visuals")
- Zaina: Kaze's wife who handles animations for the project, mentioned as being occupied with writing wedding thank you cards during this stream
- Other Contributors: Active chat community providing design suggestions and feedback during development streams; unnamed music composer mentioned for level audio

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Major thematic pivot from volcano/lava setting to oil rig construction zone to avoid repetitive level themes and improve color variety
- Extensive technical optimization challenges: "We might have to rethink the way that the elements are in this level. I might have to be multiple layers to this" due to N64 polygon limitations
- Color palette experimentation moving from monochromatic schemes to purple, yellow, and orange combinations for visual appeal
- Level structure redesigned to use distinct areas connected by pipes/transitions to manage technical constraints while maintaining gameplay variety
- Innovative water/oil effect implementation with rainbow reflections to enhance visual appeal within technical limitations

## Business Aspects
- Project confirmed as free ROM hack with no commercial distribution plans: "reskin this game and release it on a shop? I don't think I can" due to copyright constraints
- No funding or marketing strategies discussed
- Development appears to be passion project with community involvement rather than commercial venture

## Key Quotes
- "So basically our goal today will be to decide on the art style for this level. I have made some sketches and I have some basic ideas of how I want the layout to be."
- "That's all graphics is, you just make up some bullshit and then it looks good."
- "You start making a level and you feel like, wow, this is dogshit, this is garbage, this is not working out at all. And then you get a few ideas and suddenly it's like, ah, shit, this is gonna be the best thing ever."

## Potential Interview Topics

- Balancing creative vision with technical constraints of N64 hardware in modern ROM hack development
- The role of community feedback and collaboration in shaping game design decisions
- The psychological and personal challenges of long-term indie game development projects
- Technical innovation within ROM hacking constraints and pushing hardware boundaries
