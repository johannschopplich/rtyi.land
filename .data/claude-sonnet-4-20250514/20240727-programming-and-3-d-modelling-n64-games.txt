## Game Development Process
- Currently working on course 13, with hopes to finish the level within the next month, after which "just two levels missing"
- Almost completed his to-do list regarding bugs and performance issues after a week of intensive bug fixing
- Game successfully runs on actual N64 hardware with decent framerate (45-46 FPS with anti-aliasing)
- Implemented advanced features like anti-aliasing options and infinite render distance in certain levels
- Game will be under 64 megabytes when complete, with support for MP3/WAV/MIDI music imports
- Conducts live development streams showing 3D modeling and level design work

## Personal Insights
- Expresses more pride in the game than his newborn child, jokingly stating "somehow I'm more proud of this than of the child. What can I say? I'm an artist"
- Advocates for feeling-based art creation rather than following traditional principles: "you think about what feeling do I want to create and then you look at your tools and you look at how you can use your tools to create that feeling"
- Believes ROM hacks have creative advantages over commercial games: "RomEx don't have to sell well. So RomEx can get a little more creative. Because when you have to sell well, you have to make something somewhat bland"
- Strongly opposes the common advice to keep fan games secret, arguing it's counterproductive

## Collaborator Information
- Biobank: Graphics artist who created models (specifically mentioned fuzzies with protective gear) and contributed creative ideas for game elements
- Zeina: Kaze's partner who handles animations, recently became a mother to their daughter Reyna, actively participates in stream chat

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Addressing camera issues in large level areas that cause technical problems
- Balancing platforming difficulty and making jumps feel comfortable for players
- Creating atmospheric themed areas including ice castles and treasure rooms
- Solving technical challenges with frame buffer clearing on N64 hardware
- Integrating music systems while maintaining performance standards
- Making levels accessible while preserving creative vision

## Business Aspects
- Cannot legally sell physical cartridges but plans to create collector's boxes and instruction booklets without Nintendo references
- Acknowledges that others will likely create illegal cartridge reproductions

## Key Quotes
- "You don't want to operate on principles because if you operate on principles, you make art for critics, you don't make art for the sake of it being experienced."
- "Yes, somehow I'm more proud of this than of the child. What can I say? I'm an artist."
- "The thing is... All the franchises that you like that are really popular. The games that they make for those have to sell well. And RomEx don't have to sell well. So RomEx can get a little more creative."
