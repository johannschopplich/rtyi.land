## Game Development Process
- The game features 15 main courses, each containing a retro section inspired by games from the N64 era or before
- Currently working on course 11, with the immediate focus on creating a "Board the Platforms" section inspired by Super Smash Bros 64
- Implemented 16 different floor types with corresponding sound effects (grass, water, stone, creaky woods, snow, sand, ice, mud, wood, steel, glass, leaves, squishy, and grates)
- Working on "Oily Boily Bay" area featuring extensive outdoor sections with interactive sand that shows footsteps
- Targeting a 2024 release date, though Kaze acknowledges uncertainty about meeting this timeline
- Development is nearly complete for retro sections, with only 4 remaining: Board the Platforms (Smash 64), Mario Paint, Dr. Mario, and Mario Land 1

## Personal Insights
