## Game Development Process
- Currently in the object programming phase before moving to level design: "Currently, we are programming all the objects that are in here and then we're gonna make the level. So basically everything is missing."
- Demo release planned but delayed to avoid competing with other releases: "I don't know when I'm gonna release the demo. It's probably not going to be for Christmas because Robot is releasing this for like Christmas and I don't want to ruin his release."
- Game structure includes overworld and 2-5 side levels, with the game utilizing the full 64 megabytes available
- Development follows a structured approach: outline level concepts, program required mechanics, then experiment with fun platforming combinations
- Working on a space-themed arcade level with complex visual effects and low gravity areas

## Personal Insights
- Expresses frustration with game industry standards: "Game design is tough... video games are fucking awful, which means the competition is not very strong. I hate video games."
- Shows perfectionist tendencies and strong opinions about visual design choices, often scrapping work that doesn't meet his standards
- Discusses philosophy on difficulty design: "I like putting super hard things in my games. That you can only get at the very end. That most players wouldn't encounter. The problem with that is that a lot of the time players do encounter it."
- Demonstrates methodical approach to problem-solving, preferring to understand root causes rather than applying quick fixes
- Cultural perspective influences his interaction style and expectations

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: Composer for the project, but no specific current work details mentioned
- Biobak: Graphics artist described as "reworking all my stuff" - appears to handle visual asset refinement and improvement
- Zeina: Animator who created specific assets like a "carpenter" animation, acknowledged for 47 months of support and contributions to the project
- Other Contributors: UAD (frequent collaborator on mods, familiar with Tonic Trouble), Wiseguy (N64 Recomp developer), someone working on 3DS port mentioned in Discord, Malon and Brodude (successful Kickstarter creators making "bank" with $250 average per backer)

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Technical performance balancing: achieving acceptable FPS on N64 hardware while maintaining visual quality (22-25 FPS mentioned as acceptable minimum)
- Animation system limitations: Mario's animations locked to 30 FPS preventing smooth slow-motion effects
- Visual effect implementation: choosing scale animations over transparency effects for warp platforms due to material system limitations
- Memory optimization: "finding a full megabyte of RAM" described as "a nice surprise"
- Level design philosophy: creating outline first, programming mechanics second, then experimenting with fun combinations
- Color and aesthetic choices for different gameplay areas (low gravity zones, platform materials, lighting effects)

## Business Aspects
- Potential dual-release strategy: "What if, along with RTYI, I also release a game that is 90% the same content, but we replace all the Nintendo IP with our own? That is the idea. And that way we would legally own it."
- Steam distribution consideration with original IP version priced around $5
- Legal awareness: "There is some original Nintendo code left, but I am planning to replace it. Not even because I want to replace all the Nintendo code, just because the code is complete dog ass."
- Market accessibility: "Releasing the standalone as its own IP will make it much easier to show and recommend the game to other people."
- Observation of successful Kickstarter campaigns in the space, noting high per-backer averages

## Key Quotes
- "First, I make an outline of the things I want in the level. Then I think about how I can make the level fun in the way that I envision. And then I program all the stuff that I want for that. And then I just start moving it around and see what's fun."
- "If you look at some of this code, this code here on Nintendo's code was literally twice as many cycles, basically. And it's like, why is there 50% inefficiency in not even 8 lines of code?"
- "We would want there to be a difference between the Steam version and the N64 version. You would want it to look as good as possible on Steam... And then, it also being an N64, it's just a marketing thing."

## Potential Interview Topics

- The evolution from ROM hacking to potentially creating commercial games and navigating IP considerations
- Collaboration dynamics with distributed team members and how creative decisions are made across different disciplines
- The balance between artistic perfectionism and practical hardware constraints in retro game development
- Community involvement in development and how feedback influences design decisions
