## Game Development Process
- Kaze has been working on a specific cowboy-themed level for approximately two weeks, involving complex minecart sequences with Shy Guys
- The game is built on Mario 64 decompilation rather than traditional ROM hacking, allowing for advanced visual effects that "doesn't look like it can run on an N64 but it does"
- Development is highly iterative with extensive testing of mechanics, physics, and camera systems during live streams
- Major recent changes include modifying red coin star behavior to not eject players from levels and implementing new audio from Mario Kart 64 and Melee
- Progress involves both programming new mechanics and refining existing systems through community feedback during development streams

## Personal Insights
- Kaze prioritizes accessibility and player experience, stating "I want to make sure no one gets stuck ever" and planning an AI assistance feature for struggling players
- He has strong opinions about modern game design, particularly criticizing games that don't utilize analog stick controls properly
- Shows technical perfectionism but pragmatic problem-solving when faced with limitations
- Values community interaction through streaming as part of the development process
- Demonstrates passion for pushing technical boundaries while maintaining playability

## Collaborator Information
- Biobak: Graphics artist who provides visual assets and textures for the game, acknowledged as one of the first chat participants and seems to be actively involved in the project
- Zeina: Animator working on character animations, mentioned as working upstairs from Kaze's location and contributing animation work to the project
- Badub: Composer (not directly mentioned in this stream but implied through previous context)
- Other Contributors: Active chat community that provides real-time feedback and testing during development streams

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Modified red coin star mechanics to prevent level ejection, improving flow and player experience
- Implementing complex multi-object minecart sequences with precise physics and timing challenges
- Addressing camera clipping issues through walls during cutscenes by redesigning room layouts and camera settings
- Balancing challenging platforming with accessibility features, including planned AI assistance for stuck players
- Managing object collision detection and smooth transitions between different gameplay mechanics
- Creating seamless integration of new audio elements while maintaining game cohesion

## Business Aspects
- Mentions PayPal restrictions limiting access to funds, seeking alternative solutions
- Explored Twitter monetization potential, estimating $200/month revenue but needing higher engagement
- Considers hiring social media manager on revenue-sharing basis for content distribution
- Acknowledges that technical YouTube videos perform better commercially than level preview content
- No specific mention of game release plans or distribution strategy

## Key Quotes
- "The crazy part is the game doesn't look like it can run on an N64 but it does" - highlighting technical innovation
- "I want to make sure no one gets stuck ever... I'm going to build in a mechanic where if you fail a start twice, the game is going to take over for you" - demonstrating accessibility philosophy
- "there's this crazy invention they did it's the joystick... many people even game developers do not know of this trick but it is something that you can use to make your game feel a lot better" - showing passion for proper game design implementation

## Potential Interview Topics
