## Game Development Process
- All 12 main courses are completed but undergoing reworks by Biobak, with course 2 nearly finished
- Currently working on part 4 of the overworld, specifically a tunnel section connecting overworld parts 3 and 1
- Fixed major bugs including end screen transitions and render issues based on community feedback
- Planning seamless overworld transitions but facing technical limitations with memory and loading systems
- Development follows an iterative approach with post-production decisions on major elements like the hub world

## Personal Insights
- Kaze feels no pressure to rush the release: "I don't feel like I'm hard-pressed to release this as soon as possible"
- Believes in making informed design decisions: "It's much better to decide on a hub in post than to do it while you're making the game. The hub is the most important part, you need to make it with all the information available to you"
- Draws inspiration from other ROM hackers, particularly Rionu: "I'm a huge Rionu fan And I'm copying whatever Rionu does"
- Development affected by personal health issues, being sick for multiple days during this stream

## Collaborator Information
- Biobak: Graphics artist handling level reworks, nearly completed with course 2 rework and will be reworking most of the 12 main courses
- Soren: Working on animation compression techniques that could improve game performance
- Zeina: Animator mentioned in the context of living situation (appears to share living space with Kaze)
- Other Contributors: References to community members providing real-time feedback and suggestions during development streams

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Overworld design features a circular progression where players start seeing a lighthouse, progress through multiple areas, and eventually reach that lighthouse from above
- Major technical challenge with seamless area transitions due to memory limitations: "we don't have enough memory to just keep the old area loaded while loading a new one"
- Debating fast travel mechanics including pipes, cannons, and world map systems for player convenience
- Balancing technical constraints with design vision, particularly regarding loading times and rendering capabilities
- Decision to prioritize gameplay functionality over visual polish during development phase

## Business Aspects
- Considering physical cartridge release for the game's OST: "maybe we can do like a physical cartridge release of the game's OST Which would be the coolest shit ever"
- Cannot release the actual game physically due to legal constraints: "I can't release the game physically and I will actually get murdered"
- Plans to create a "legally distinct version" of the project
- Acknowledges donation requests are possible but discouraged for ROM hack projects

## Key Quotes
- "It's much better to decide on a hub in post than to do it while you're making the game. The hub is the most important part, you need to make it with all the information available to you"
- "I don't feel like I'm hard-pressed to release this as soon as possible, though. So I think we're all good"
- "we don't have enough memory to just keep the old area loaded while loading a new one"

## Potential Interview Topics
- The collaborative process with Biobak on level design and reworks - how do they coordinate vision and execution?
- Technical innovation within ROM hacking constraints - what creative solutions has the team developed?
- The influence of other ROM hackers like Rionu on development philosophy and approach
- Balancing community feedback with artistic vision during live development streams
- Long-term sustainability of passion projects without commercial pressure - how do they maintain motivation and quality?
