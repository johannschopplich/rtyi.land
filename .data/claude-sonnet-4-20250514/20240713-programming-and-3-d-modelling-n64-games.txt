## Game Development Process
- Currently working on snowman cave level with multiple sections including climbing areas, platforms over void, and planned slide sections
- Using "greyboxing" method for level design - placing rough geometry first, then finalizing aesthetics later
- Second star's platforming design is nearly complete, with plans for slide section and treasure room
- F3 demo planned for July 27th, with Matrix video content planned for August 1st
- Planning to collect community feedback through Google document for physics and camera adjustments
- Staying within original N64 hardware limitations (64MB cartridge size) as core design principle
- Open source project planned after RTY completion to port optimizations back to vanilla Mario 64

## Personal Insights
- Feeling mentally unclear during stream, attributed to extensive swimming activities with Zeyna
- Reflects on past period of 4 years living in isolation, noting it affected his mental state but led to appreciating small things
- Strong belief that hitting one million YouTube subscribers would be achievable with focused content strategy
- Values staying within original hardware limitations as matter of authenticity: "If I don't stay within the original limitations, am I not kind of cheating?"
- Cares deeply about performance optimization, even down to microsecond-level improvements
- Anticipating daughter's birth in 5 days, which may affect streaming schedule

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: Composer creating music for the project
- "Mario back": Model artist who reviews and improves Kaze's 3D models, making them "look a lot better"
- Zeyna: Contributing animations, concept art, and various other tasks throughout development
- Other Contributors: Hired video editor at $16 per minute rate; mentions people "randomly contribute small things" to the project

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Designing snowman cave with multiple traversal options - "many ways to climb this, no right way"
- Addressing shadow rendering issues by creating separate shadow objects that can find floor properly independent of Mario
- ROM space limitations severely restricting voice lines and asset usage: "Voice lines specifically are very expensive"
- Implementing anti-aliasing on real N64 hardware while maintaining performance
- Balancing elevator mechanics (actual movement vs teleportation) for player experience
- Creating slide sections with surreal half-clear backgrounds for "very trippy" visual effect

## Business Aspects
- Nintendo has taken down 70 of his videos, indicating ongoing copyright tensions
- Plans to scale YouTube content production with hired editor, potentially creating 70-80 videos about Mario 64 topics
- Estimates potential to reach one million subscribers with focused content strategy
- Charging $70/hour for custom mod work (mentioned in context of My Little Pony mod request)
- Maintaining authentic N64 limitations as selling point rather than using modern hardware capabilities

## Key Quotes
- "So just so you guys know, in five days, my daughter is likely going to be born. Meaning I might not be able to stream next week."
- "They took down 70 of my videos, just so you are aware of how much they hate me." (referring to Nintendo)
- "If I don't stay within the original limitations, am I not kind of cheating? You see the issue. I don't want to finish the game and then people are like, oh, yeah, but to use more memory, though."

## Potential Interview Topics
- The tension between creative freedom and Nintendo's copyright enforcement - how does the threat of takedowns affect the development process?
- The philosophy behind maintaining N64 hardware limitations in modern ROM hack development
- The collaborative process with team members and how responsibilities are divided
- The transition from solo development to building a small team
- Plans for post-RTY projects, including the open source optimization project for vanilla Mario 64
