## Game Development Process
- Project is approximately 73% complete with 11 out of 15 courses finished
- Significant progress being made both on-stream and off-stream, with complex work typically done off-stream
- Current focus on boss fight implementation, specifically a "block boss" with soap-based mechanics
- Major performance improvements have been implemented off-stream
- ROM size constraints becoming a critical issue at 45.9 MB out of 64 MB limit, with potential to exceed budget
- Strong commitment to maintaining N64 compatibility throughout development

## Personal Insights
- Philosophy that "video games are not supposed to be chores" - strong opposition to games that feel like work
- High standards for game quality: "it's hard to make a good game, and most people just don't"
- Pragmatic approach to monetization and business decisions
- Preference for working on complex technical challenges off-stream while using streams for simpler tasks
- Lives in Canada but grew up in Germany, recently bought a house and moving
- Self-deprecating humor about being "a hater" with very high standards for games

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: Composer who created "a new song for the boombox koopas" that Kaze describes as "really good"
- Biobak: Graphics artist working on 3D models and technical implementation, actively involved in combiner and rendering discussions
- Zeina/Lila: Animator working on character animations and visual effects, involved in technical discussions about Fast64 bugs and improvements
- Other Contributors: T Lopez mentioned in relation to soundtrack work

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- ROM size management is critical challenge: music comprises 70% of file size (35.6 MB), limiting space for additional content
- Boss fight design focused on skill-based mechanics rather than time-consuming grinding
- Balancing difficulty to avoid large skill gaps between good and bad players
- Environmental design evolution from oil barrel concept to warehouse/cave hybrid setting
- Technical challenges with Fast64 animation tools and combiner systems
- Decision to use soap-based combat mechanics for boss encounters

## Business Aspects
- YouTube streaming revenue increased to $400/month, partly attributed to ad blocker issues
- No specific monetization strategy for the game itself mentioned
- No concrete release timeline provided due to full-time job constraints
- Focus remains on creating quality content rather than rushing to market

## Key Quotes
- "They're turning video games into chores. Video games are not supposed to be chores! That's my rant for the day."
- "I don't really have any requirement I have for something to be considered a good game. It's more so than just it's hard to make a good game, and most people just don't."
- "our ROM is 45.9 megabytes that's like almost three quarters of there to 64 megabytes so we have an issue of just not having any more space for music soon"

## Potential Interview Topics
- The philosophy behind avoiding "chore-like" gameplay and maintaining player engagement
- Technical innovation within N64 hardware constraints and ROM size limitations
- The collaborative creative process with musicians and artists working remotely
- Balancing authentic retro gaming experience with modern design sensibilities
- The role of community feedback through streaming in the development process
- Challenges of maintaining N64 compatibility while implementing modern game design concepts
