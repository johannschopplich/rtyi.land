## Game Development Process
- Currently working on course/level 12 (mine area) and has made "big restructures" after realizing the original design wasn't good
- Progress indicated as "Quiz 12 out of 15" suggesting the game is substantially complete
- Actively working on gameplay elements like minecarts and red coin placement
- Uses an iterative design approach, willing to completely restructure levels when they don't meet his standards
- Working on both visual elements (3D modeling, textures) and gameplay mechanics simultaneously

## Personal Insights
- Has strong opinions about boss design: "I think boss gameplay is always boring. I think I can only enjoy bosses as set pieces"
- Targets a "hardcore" audience: "for like, a weird nerd that's been playing Nintendo games in his basement for 25 years, my game is definitely going to be way better"
- Believes his game serves a different audience than mainstream Nintendo releases
- Dislikes traditional action games and boss-centric games like Monster Hunter and Souls-like games
- Values gameplay flow and never wants players to "stand around awkwardly and wait"

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: No relevant information found in this transcript
- Biobak: Mentioned as "Biobank" who may "remove this and put his own thing" during reworking phases, suggesting he does refinement passes on Kaze's work
- Zeina: No relevant information found in this transcript
- Other Contributors: "Maiku" appears to be a collaborator who provides feedback and "gonna complain about" certain design choices

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Redesigned level 12 by removing one area and relocating the train station after determining the original layout was inadequate
- Boss design philosophy focuses on "freeform bosses" where players can hit them when they want, with phases that can be accelerated through skillful play
- Struggling with red coin placement: "we only have six red coins and I'm out of creative ideas for this area"
- Designing the mine area as a "Goomba gang's hideout" with bandits carrying cork guns
- Balancing difficulty and accessibility in platforming sections
