## Game Development Process
- Currently working on course 12 out of 15 total levels, specifically implementing a piano-playing Shy Guy in a Wild West Saloon setting
- The game runs on real N64 hardware at close to 60 FPS due to highly optimized engine
- Facing memory constraints that require ongoing optimization of collision triangles and assets
- Using Fast3DX2 engine currently but planning to upgrade to Fast3DX3 for better performance
- Plans to implement card gun mechanics inspired by Mario Party 2 with countdown sequences
- Development involves iterative testing and refinement of gameplay elements

## Personal Insights
- Describes ROM hacking as "technically just a hobby but I do work on them full-time"
- Recently gained new perspective on the importance of soft skills and communication in professional work
- Values game atmosphere and "vibe" over purely functional mechanics ("Dude, he's there for the vibe. I can't just hit him")
- Has evolved beyond enjoying competitive games due to over-analyzing them as "math formulas in a permanent loop"
- Balances passion project development with full-time professional programming work

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: No specific information mentioned in this transcript
- Biobak: No specific information mentioned in this transcript  
- Zeina: Animator and 3D modeler who created the piano-playing Shy Guy character, piano model, and handles vertex coloring. Kaze praises her work quality and smooth animations
- Other Contributors: Lila (involved with UV mapping and quality control, described as catching technical errors), QED (consulted for asset ripping from Mario Party 2)

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Major challenge with RAM overflow requiring careful memory optimization and collision triangle reduction
- Implementation of directional audio panning to create spatial sound effects for the piano music
- Design decision to make all NPCs in the saloon turn and look at the player when they interrupt the piano performance
- Camera positioning and cinematography choices for dramatic effect during planned gunfight sequences
- Balancing visual fidelity with performance constraints on original N64 hardware
- Maintaining thematic consistency with 1990s-era Mario game aesthetics

## Business Aspects
- Kaze works full-time as a programmer on Unreal Engine 5 games under NDA, which is his primary income source
- Cautious about ROM distribution and beta testing due to concerns about leaks
- Streams development process on YouTube after migrating from Twitch
- No specific monetization or release distribution plans mentioned for the ROM hack itself

## Key Quotes
- "Yes, this whole game runs on real hardware. The scene you just saw actually runs close to 60 FPS on real hardware because my engine is that optimized."
- "romhacks are technically just a hobby but I do work on them full-time so make of that what you will"
- "Dude, he's there for the vibe. I can't just hit him." (regarding not making the piano player an enemy)

## Potential Interview Topics
- The technical challenge of optimizing for original N64 hardware versus modern emulation
- The collaborative process of working with remote team members and managing creative input
- The balance between maintaining a passion project while working a full-time programming job
- The decision-making process behind preserving authentic 1990s Mario aesthetics while adding modern innovations
- The evolution from hobby ROM hacking to a full-time creative focus and what drives that commitment
