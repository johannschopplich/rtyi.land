## Game Development Process
- The game currently has 12 levels completed with plans for additional content: "Currently we have 12 levels done. We need 20 more stars. We need to do some overworld stuff still. But almost everything is there."
- Development is progressing rapidly on the current cowboy-themed level: "We started on this level like 2 weeks ago and we already have the first mission done. This is gonna be like the fastest developed level yet and it's so cool looking too."
- The project targets real N64 hardware with extensive optimization work: "Yeah, of course this runs on real hardware. What do you think I do all the optimization for, for emulator?"
- The game features a complex multi-area level design with various gameplay mechanics including treasure hunts, boss fights, and storyline missions

## Personal Insights
- Kaze attributes his consistent productivity to a disciplined, almost mechanical approach to work: "No, I actually never suffer from burnout. And that's because I do not have a soul. I was literally just a robot. I just make game. I just don't stop."
- He emphasizes discipline over motivation in creative work: "Well if you rely on motivation it's not gonna work. You just have to do the thing regardless of whether you want to or not. It's really that simple. Like just do the thing."
- He maintains strong opinions about game design quality, particularly regarding control schemes and technical execution
- He discusses upcoming parenthood and jokes about potential future interactions with his child regarding his work

## Collaborator Information
- Zeina: Primary contributor working on 3D models and animations, specifically mentioned creating the dragon model and various cowboy-themed NPCs including hat textures and character designs
- Silas: Mentioned as wanting to rework a "squishiness function" with "a cool idea"
- Various unnamed community contributors: Referenced as providing assets, textures, and technical feedback through Discord channels
- Other Contributors: References to people working on pipes, textures, and other game assets, though specific names and roles aren't always clearly defined

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- The cowboy level features a complex narrative structure with multiple mission types: bank robbery storyline, train station shootouts, and treasure hunting mechanics
- Technical optimization challenges for N64 hardware, including texture compression and polygon count management
- Design philosophy focuses on thematic coherence: "I feel like recently I have a leveled up a lot of my skills and this level is like the first one that has those applied and I'm pretty happy with it. It's very thematic everything is purposeful"
- Balancing family-friendly content while maintaining Wild West authenticity: "We have to keep this like pg-8, you know. They're all gonna be drinking milk. They're gonna shoot cork guns. It's gonna be all goofy"

## Business Aspects
- The project targets real N64 hardware compatibility, suggesting potential for physical release or cartridge distribution
- Discussion of Nintendo's policies and potential legal considerations around ROM hacking
- Multi-platform streaming strategy using both Twitch and YouTube simultaneously
- No specific monetization or funding models discussed in this transcript
