## Game Development Process
- Currently working systematically through level design with Course 15 (space-themed level) in active development, featuring flying cars, parking lots, and retrofuturistic elements
- Following structured approach where "All the courses will have an analysis before Biobank's rework happens. Right now, Biobank is working on course 2"
- Hub world being saved for last as "by far the most important part of the game" - planned as full explorable Yoshi's Island with extensive secrets
- Focus on performance optimization, actively reducing polygon counts (from 82 to 64 triangles in observed work session)
- Plans to add "more secret levels than the original game had" to enhance hub world experience

## Personal Insights
- Strong belief that hub worlds are crucial to game success: "The hub world is I think the only reason Mario 64 was famous, popular. If Mario 64 hadn't had a hub world, I don't think anyone would have liked the game"
- Perfectionist approach to development: "I want to make the most alive-feeling hub of all time. There's going to be so much shit in the hub"
- Acknowledges the exhausting nature of content creation: "Making working on that video makes me feel so sick. It's so much work and so exhausting"
- Values player experience over technical showmanship, frequently asking "wouldn't want the player to do that" when evaluating difficulty

## Collaborator Information
- **Biobak**: Currently working on Course 2 rework, collaborating on boss design concepts including "Octoyoshi" with tentacles and tumor-healing mechanics
- **Zeina**: Contributing character animations, specifically mentioned as having "already drew something for them" regarding shy guy NPCs
- **Bruno Gadsen**: Providing 3D models, specifically retrofuturistic CRT designs that align with the game's aesthetic vision
- **Other Contributors**: GBA port developer collaborating on video content, Dan Salvato providing feedback, various community members offering graphics assistance (though Kaze expresses concerns about teaching time vs. productivity)

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Balancing technical constraints with visual appeal: constant polygon optimization while maintaining aesthetic quality
- Player accessibility focus: "This is too awkward of a platforming thing to like do it like I wouldn't want the player to do that"
- Art direction commitment to retrofuturism: "This looks very retro-futuristic and I like this"
- Boss design evolution: developing Octoyoshi concept with attack patterns involving black holes, tentacles, and internal tumor destruction mechanics
- Movement system refinement: adapting dive mechanics based on community feedback while maintaining Mario 64 core movement

## Business Aspects
- Dual release strategy planned: "using the static recompilation to release this game both like as an n64 game with Mario and Officially as like a game on Steam"
- Legal awareness regarding Nintendo IP: "Obviously, I would replace all Nintendo assets and would kick out the last bit of Nintendo code as well. I'm not just going to release a Mario game on Steam"
- Funding constraints: "I don't really have the money to commission random people, but I would absolutely like to get work done for this game"
- Kickstarter concerns: "I'm scared of using Kickstarter and because of sales tax loss. I don't understand how they work with Kickstarter"

## Key Quotes
- "The hub world is by far the most important part of the game. And you need to make sure it's perfect. And to do so it is best if you already have all the other levels done."
- "I want to make the most alive-feeling hub of all time. There's going to be so much shit in the hub."
- "Most of the time the people that 3d model are also the ones designing it... I'm not gonna pay someone so I can make their ideas for them."
