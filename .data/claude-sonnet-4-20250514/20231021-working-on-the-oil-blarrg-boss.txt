## Game Development Process
- The project is in active development with multiple systems being implemented including boss fights, star select screens, and various level environments
- Technical work includes complex animation systems (submarine movement, bird animations), lighting effects, and physics implementation
- The overworld is planned for a complete rework with a tropical island theme inspired by Mario Party
- Retro sections are planned featuring Paper Mario 64 Goomba Town, Mario Paint, Dr. Mario, Mario Land 1, and Smash 64
- Development is transitioning to a new physical location ("Kaze dungeon")

## Personal Insights
- Kaze demonstrates strong perfectionist tendencies, refusing to settle for "good enough" solutions and insisting on understanding why technical issues occur
- He maintains clear creative vision, rejecting community suggestions that don't align with his design philosophy (specifically rejecting music-themed level ideas)
- Shows concern about maintaining artistic integrity and separating his personal identity from the game: "The player shouldn't even know that I exist when he plays this game"
- Expresses frustration with technical challenges but demonstrates persistence in solving complex problems
- Values community input but maintains final creative control over design decisions

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: No specific information found in this transcript
- Biobak: No specific information found in this transcript  
- Zeina: Mentioned as providing input on game design decisions and having played "Donkey Donkey Mario 64"
- Other Contributors: 
  - Biomech: Active graphics collaborator working on lighting effects, visual design, and 3D modeling (submarine, lighting systems)
  - Skellux: Referenced as inspiration for a pink bob-omb character in a previous project
  - Community members providing level theme suggestions and feedback during streams

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Boss fight balancing is ongoing with concerns about difficulty level and need for additional coins/power-ups
- Level theme selection process involves community input but final decisions rest with Kaze (rejected music level, considering Wild West, comic book superhero, and Arctic ice cream train themes)
- Technical challenges include implementing smooth sine wave animations, proper lighting effects with color blending issues, and complex animation systems
- Performance optimization is a constant consideration, with specific attention to N64 hardware limitations
- Visual consistency and artistic coherence are prioritized over individual feature requests

## Business Aspects
- Recent video performance exceeded expectations, getting "twice as good as my second best video of the last 10 excluding f3"
- No specific monetization, funding, or distribution plans discussed
- Streaming schedule affected by physical relocation of development setup
- Community engagement through live streaming appears to be part of development process

## Key Quotes
- "The player shouldn't even know that I exist when he plays this game. That way, if in the future I get cancelled on Twitter, no one has to put down the game."
- "I Think all that's missing right now for the boss fight is the grills animating"
- "The entire overworld will be reworked, so nothing you see in the overworld is going to be the same"

## Potential Interview Topics
- The collaborative relationship between Kaze and Biomech and how their creative processes complement each other
- Kaze's philosophy on balancing community input with creative vision and maintaining artistic integrity
- The technical challenges of working within N64 hardware limitations and how they influence design decisions
- The evolution of the project's scope and how the overworld redesign reflects the game's growing ambition
- The decision-making process behind retro section selections and how they tie into the game's overall narrative/thematic structure
