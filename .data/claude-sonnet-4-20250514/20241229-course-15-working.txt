## Game Development Process
- RTYI demo is completed but facing compatibility issues with Parallel Launcher that Kaze is working to resolve with the maintainer
- Currently developing level 15 (the final level) called "Astrologate" - a space-themed level that underwent major redesign during the stream
- Targeting 30 FPS on console and 60 FPS on PC, with acknowledgment that some areas will run worse than benchmark areas
- Planning an explorable overworld covering the entirety of Yoshi's Island with 6-9 secret levels and additional secret overworld stars
- Each level includes a "retro area" themed after pixel art games, with this level's retro area being Mario 64-themed

## Personal Insights
- Kaze demonstrates strong commitment to iterative design, willing to completely abandon concepts that aren't working (pivoting from arcade to shy guy space station theme)
- Values "placeness" - the quality that makes game environments feel like believable, functional locations rather than arbitrary game spaces
- Prefers "form follows function" design philosophy, ensuring every element serves both aesthetic and gameplay purposes
- Expresses frustration with one-on-one help requests, preferring community-based assistance due to communication challenges
- Shows willingness to reference and learn from other games while avoiding direct copying

## Collaborator Information
- Badoop: Composer who has uploaded music to SoundCloud; Kaze discusses potentially paying for rights to use the music and mentions this as part of potential monetization plans
- Biobak: Graphics artist who receives payment for contributions to the project
- Zeina: Not mentioned in this transcript
- Other Contributors: Unnamed musicians that Kaze hopes to compensate; Parallel Launcher maintainer working on compatibility issues

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Major design pivot from arcade theme to "shy guy space station" due to arcade games not translating well to 3D platforming gameplay
- Designing within strict size limitations (30,000 units) while trying to create sense of openness and exploration
- Creating structured progression that feels open rather than linear, using locked areas and visual previews to guide player curiosity
- Developing a boss fight with a bioluminescent space squid that serves as both spectacle and unlock mechanism for the rest of the level
- Balancing visual appeal with gameplay functionality, particularly regarding lighting and platform visibility

## Business Aspects
- Mentions "crazy plans to maybe, hopefully, somehow monetize this game" and potential need for copyright lawyer consultation
- Currently employed at "Gears of War Breakfast" which limits development time
- Reinvests community donations back into the project, specifically mentioning payments to collaborators
- Received significant community support during stream ($521 donation) demonstrating engaged fanbase
- Considers potential for physical cartridge release including licensed music

## Key Quotes
- "I think we made very good and valuable progress today. Even though we didn't physically change many things. We made some very very important notes. For the design of the stage. We made the important realization. That the idea we had for this level is terrible. And we're going to do something better."
- "The overworld in this game will be the entirety of Yoshi's Island. So you will be able to explore every single square inch of Yoshi's Island in the overworld. That's the idea. And I think that will be super fun."
- "I actually have crazy plans to maybe, hopefully, somehow monetize this game. And if that happens, we're going crazy."
