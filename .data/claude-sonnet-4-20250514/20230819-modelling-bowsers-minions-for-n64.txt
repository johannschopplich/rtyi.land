## Game Development Process
- Currently working on the "Bowser protest" level, indicating late-stage development
- Significant progress achieved with "115 stars done or maybe even 118" suggesting near completion
- Actively testing performance on real N64 hardware, with optimization being a major focus
- Using Mario 64 decompilation as the base, allowing for extensive modifications while maintaining compatibility
- Development has been ongoing "over a few months now" with Kaze balancing it alongside full-time employment

## Personal Insights
- Kaze maintains a full-time programming job while developing the game: "I have a full-time job on the side. So that's why I don't have too much time to just work on this all the time"
- Demonstrates strong technical knowledge and problem-solving approach to game development challenges
- Shows commitment to quality and authenticity, constantly testing and refining elements for optimal N64 performance
- Expresses humor and personality throughout development, maintaining a lighthearted approach despite technical complexities

## Collaborator Information
- **Biobak**: Graphics artist who creates and optimizes 3D models. Contributed an improved "Purple floor switch" model that was "so much better than the one we had before" and actively reduces triangle counts for performance optimization
- **Zeina**: Animator who works on character animations. Was expected to "finish the animation for the guy here" but was unavailable during this stream
- **Other Contributors**: Unnamed musicians who Kaze plans to compensate: "I was offering to pay the musicians as well, for like the rights to the music, once everything's done." Also mentions Wiseguy, creator of Matrix Stack Fix for lighting improvements

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Major focus on N64 performance optimization, with frame rate being a critical concern throughout development
- Struggling with creating convincing ocean backgrounds that work within N64 rendering limitations: "I think the NBG is just not the possible here"
- Balancing level population and engagement: "I Think it's missing a lot of coins that we put everywhere Like this is too dead for me"
- Maintaining Mario 64 authenticity while adding new elements, such as keeping familiar switch designs: "every Bowser level in Mario 64 uses this exact switch"
- Technical challenges with collision detection, memory management, and rendering optimization

## Business Aspects
- Exploring legal merchandise opportunities: "a merch company has written me, and they said they can print custom products. So they were saying, if we want to, we can make N64 boxes and sell those as merch"
- Considering legal distribution methods: "when I sell RGYI, I could just sell the box without the ROM, and it'd be legal"
- Planning revenue sharing with collaborators: "if the set makes decent money, I have to pay you. I completely agree"
- Exploring creative monetization approaches that work within ROM hacking legal constraints

## Key Quotes
- "I have been working on this over a few months now But I have a full-time job on the side. So that's why I don't have too much time to just work on this all the time" - Shows the challenge of balancing passion projects with professional obligations
- "Dude, we're gonna be fucking millionaires. Dude, we're gonna make a full ROM making company. If that works out, I'm like, I don't know, maybe I'm gonna start hiring people" - Reveals ambitious vision for the project's potential
- "every Bowser level in Mario 64 uses this exact switch to help Mario beat the stage This this is just a very Mario 64 Bowser design" - Demonstrates commitment to maintaining series authenticity

## Potential Interview Topics
- The technical challenges and innovations involved in optimizing modern game design for N64 hardware limitations
- The collaborative process of working with remote team members (Biobak, Zeina) and coordinating different aspects of development
- The evolution from hobby ROM hack to potential commercial venture and the legal considerations involved
- The balance between preserving Mario 64's authentic feel while introducing new gameplay elements and level designs
- The ROM hacking community dynamics and how community feedback influences development decisions
