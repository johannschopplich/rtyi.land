## Game Development Process
- Currently in active development of the overworld system, which is described as "massive" and consists of 13 interconnected parts
- Working on finalizing the story and third Bowser level, indicating they're in mid-to-late development stages
- Planning a complex progression system with 21 overworld stars, secret levels, and special events
- Using community feedback during live development streams to refine design decisions
- Development is described as "extremely mentally exhausting," suggesting intensive creative work phases

## Personal Insights

- Experiences development fatigue: "doing this overworld is extremely mentally exhausting and I might not be able to do it on Tuesday"
- Has strong opinions about game design elements, particularly disliking certain Mario characters like the Koopalings
- Prioritizes player agency and exploration freedom in design philosophy
