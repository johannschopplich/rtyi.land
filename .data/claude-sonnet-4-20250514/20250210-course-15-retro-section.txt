## Game Development Process
- Currently working on the final level and "retro section" that combines all Mario 64 levels into one area, similar to "only up 64" hack
- Facing significant memory constraints with only about a quarter megabyte remaining
- Still needs to complete the overworld and side courses after current level work
- Project appears to be in advanced stages but still requires substantial work to completion

## Personal Insights
- Takes a defiant stance toward potential Nintendo takedowns, viewing them as opportunities rather than threats
- Demonstrates technical perfectionism, particularly frustrated with original Mario 64's "fucked up UV coordinates" and poor geometry
- Values creative skill-based shortcuts in level design but opposes trivializing gameplay mechanics
- Shows confidence in his technical abilities and willingness to pivot the project into an original game if necessary

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: No relevant information found in this transcript
- Biobak: Mentioned as "Biotech" who "made like most of the levels" for a separate drug-themed Mario commission project
- Zeina: No relevant information found in this transcript
- Other Contributors: References to community input through chat for level design decisions and mentions working collaboratively on level splitting and design choices

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Major memory management constraints forcing careful optimization and triangle reduction
- Implementing wing cap mechanics while ensuring levels remain beatable without extended moveset
- Creating a cohesive retro section that meaningfully combines all Mario 64 levels rather than simple recreation
- Balancing level difficulty and accessibility, particularly around skip opportunities and alternative paths
- Technical challenges with UV mapping fixes and vertex coloring implementation

## Business Aspects
- Mentions this being "a paid commission" work (referring to separate drug-themed Mario hack)
- Expresses willingness to convert project into original IP and sell on Steam if Nintendo intervenes
- Shows awareness of audience size as protection from Nintendo attention ("I'm just a 100 viewer YouTube channel")
- Discusses potential PR benefits of Nintendo takedown scenario

## Key Quotes
- "I'm not scared of the Nintendo Ninjas. I am fully aware that I might get taken down, but if that happens, we can use that to spin some PR moves, and just rewrite the game into my own custom game."
- "I want player to at least be creative when they skip something, otherwise it's not fun."
- "We have not much space left, maybe like a quarter of a megabyte... Our main issue here is that we are running out of memory."

## Potential Interview Topics
- The technical philosophy behind fixing original Mario 64's perceived flaws while maintaining its essence
- The collaborative relationship with community feedback and how streaming influences development decisions
- The strategic thinking behind potential Nintendo legal challenges and backup plans for project continuation
- The creative process of combining all Mario 64 levels into a cohesive retro section design
- Memory optimization techniques and how technical constraints shape creative decisions in ROM hacking
