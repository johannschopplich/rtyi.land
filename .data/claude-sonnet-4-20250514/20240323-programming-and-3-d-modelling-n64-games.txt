## Game Development Process
- The game is nearing completion with only three levels remaining: "only three levels are missing and i already finished one area of that that's like end game but it's still gonna take a long time but still it's like it's the last fifth of the game that feels like end stretch to me"
- Successfully achieved N64 hardware compatibility: "I made this whole game... I made sure it all works on N64 now. I think we should be able to just run around in the game now without crashes" with performance at "40 FPS before we even optimized it"
- Target release timeline of "before 2026 maybe" with total game scope of "around 180 stars something like that so but only 120 of those are gonna actually maybe like 130 of those are gonna be real content"
- Development includes both public streaming work and private collaboration on secret areas that cannot be shown yet
- Engine has been polished with various optimizations discovered during testing

## Personal Insights
- Frustration with Nintendo's interference: "I feel like without Nintendo's interference, I would have a million subs by now. No exaggeration. Maybe not a million. Maybe like 800,000"
- Strong commitment to original projects: "I have enough work right now with the projects that were my own ideas"
- Excitement about hidden progress: "Dude, I wish I could show you guys what I made upstream. It's so cool"
- Perfectionist approach to game design, focusing on details like reaction times and hardware optimization
- Values transparency with community while respecting collaborator agreements

## Collaborator Information
- **Biobank**: Graphics artist who refines Kaze's work - "usually after I'm done, we got Biobank looking over it and he makes them a lot better"
- **Zeina**: Animator who was unavailable during this stream - "Can you believe Zeyna's on babysitting instead of making games with me right now?"
- **Leela**: Technical contributor working on animation systems - "That's likely going to change once Leela is finished with her Quaternions, because they give us free translation as long as we don't use it"
- **UED**: Model provider - "Good thing UED has sent me a model of it"
- **Other Contributors**: Unnamed ROM maker collaborating on secret areas - "Because it's a collab with another RobMaker and he asked me not to"

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Implementation of a reaction-based duel minigame with Boshi featuring precise timing mechanics: "the top human reaction time still something they do is like 210 milliseconds and then the console itself also it's like 80 milliseconds of input lag so likely we have to go at least 300 milliseconds"
- Gun mechanics with consequences for early shooting: "If you shoot early your gun will blow up in your face"
- Focus on N64 hardware optimization rather than emulator performance: prioritizing authentic hardware experience
- Ongoing overworld stability issues while individual levels function properly
- Detailed cutscene and camera work requiring multiple iterations for proper framing

## Business Aspects
- Significant concern about Nintendo takedowns: "they will absolutely take it down and i will have to release a copyright free version that is gonna happen"
- Previous experience with content removal: "they've already taken down 70 of my videos"
- Strategic release planning to avoid conflicts with Nintendo releases: "if you release your romhack around the same time as a big nintendo game comes out you are going to get taken down 100%"
- Plans for future Kickstarter campaign: "because i'm gonna bundle it together with the ad for my kickstarter for the game i'm gonna make after i'm done with return to yoshi's islands"
- Consideration of multiple release versions including copyright-free alternatives

## Key Quotes
- "only three levels are missing and i already finished one area of that that's like end game but it's still gonna take a long time but still it's like it's the last fifth of the game that feels like end stretch to me" - Shows both progress and realistic timeline expectations
