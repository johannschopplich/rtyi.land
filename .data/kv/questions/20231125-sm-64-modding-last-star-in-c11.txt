{"kaze":[{"context":"You mentioned that RTYI is built on a custom engine derived from the SM64 decompilation project, and a significant portion of early development went into this foundational work.","question":"Kaze, can you walk us through the initial decision to build a custom engine for 'Return to Yoshi's Island'? What were the biggest hurdles you faced in its creation, and what unique capabilities did it unlock that wouldn't have been possible with existing SM64 modding tools?"},{"context":"You've spoken passionately about your self-imposed deadlines and your critique of 'modern game design,' contrasting it with your desire to create an 'experience' that 'doesn't waste your time.'","question":"Your work ethic is clearly intense, with 14 straight days of meeting deadlines mentioned. How does this personal discipline connect with your philosophy on game design, particularly your view that 'modern game design is made for people that are depressed'? How are you ensuring RTYI offers a distinct, engaging 'experience'?"},{"context":"The N64's limitations, especially the 4KB texture memory, are a constant battle, leading to what you humorously called 'cursed texture resolutions.'","question":"You’ve described working with N64 texture limitations as 'fucking sucks.' Could you share a specific instance where these constraints almost broke a design idea for RTYI, and how you creatively navigated that technical bottleneck to still achieve your vision for a level or character?"},{"context":"You plan to release RTYI and simultaneously launch a Kickstarter for a new Unreal Engine game, aiming to 'make big money' with this new venture.","question":"Launching a passion project like RTYI alongside a Kickstarter for a new commercial Unreal Engine game is a bold strategy. What's the thinking behind this dual launch, and how do you see the spirit and learnings from RTYI influencing your approach to this new, potentially larger-scale project?"},{"context":"You've stated that RTYI's source code will be made public, yet you expressed doubt that anyone will have the 'skill or patience' to create a PC port due to its complexity.","question":"You're making RTYI open source but seem skeptical about PC ports. What specific aspects of RTYI's custom engine or design make it so intrinsically tied to the N64 architecture, and what are your hopes for the community by making its inner workings public, even if direct ports are unlikely?"},{"context":"You're balancing difficulty by focusing on how 'cool a jump has to be' rather than arbitrary difficulty, and designing new areas like the 'OBB underground' with specific mechanics.","question":"When designing new challenges, like those in the OBB underground with its slides and hydraulic platforms, how do you define that 'coolness' factor in a jump or a puzzle, and how do you ensure it aligns with your goal of making the game engaging without being unnecessarily frustrating or time-wasting?"},{"context":"Collaboration is key, with mentions of Biobak for graphics and the critical need for 'quaternion animations' from Lila, highlighting specialized contributions.","question":"RTYI involves several collaborators working on specialized aspects like graphics and animations. How has this collaborative process, often remote, shaped the game, and can you describe a moment where a contribution from a team member significantly evolved, or perhaps even saved, a feature you were struggling with?"}],"biobak":[{"context":"Kaze discussed N64 texture limitations with you during the stream, specifically mentioning the 'cursed texture resolution' for a sail texture and the strict 4KB total texture memory.","question":"Biobak, Kaze highlighted the extreme N64 texture constraints, like the 4KB total memory. Could you describe your creative process for designing compelling visuals for RTYI within such tight technical boundaries, and perhaps share an example of a particularly challenging asset you had to optimize?"},{"context":"The stream showed an interaction where Kaze asked for a Blender file for a sail texture to work on it further, implying a close iterative process.","question":"We saw a glimpse of your collaboration with Kaze on the sail texture. Can you tell us more about how you and Kaze iterate on artistic assets? How do you balance your artistic vision with the N64's technical demands and Kaze's specific gameplay needs?"},{"context":"RTYI aims for a unique aesthetic that honors its N64 roots while being a new creation. You are responsible for translating this vision into the game's visual style.","question":"What has been the most rewarding aspect of translating the vision for 'Return to Yoshi's Island' into a tangible visual style on the N64, and what elements or specific designs are you most proud of artistically in this project?"}],"badub":[{"context":"Kaze mentioned his plan to secure the rights to the music you compose for RTYI and release it as an album, possibly even on a physical N64-style cartridge.","question":"Badub, Kaze has expressed a strong desire to release the RTYI soundtrack, highlighting its importance to the game. How have you approached composing music that complements Kaze's unique vision for RTYI and the N64 platform, and what are your thoughts on the potential for a physical album release?"},{"context":"RTYI is a fan-made project with a distinct feel, aiming to be an 'experience' rather than just a time-waster, drawing on nostalgia but also innovating.","question":"From a musical perspective, how do you capture the specific atmosphere and emotional beats of 'Return to Yoshi's Island'? Are there particular themes or gameplay moments in RTYI that have been especially inspiring or challenging to score to fit this unique blend?"},{"context":"The project is a deep dive into the N64 aesthetic and limitations, not just graphically but likely musically as well, requiring a blend of authenticity and modern sensibility.","question":"What are the unique challenges and opportunities when composing music intended to evoke the N64 era, and how do you balance capturing that nostalgic authenticity with your own creative musical style for RTYI?"}],"zeina":[{"context":"The stream highlighted animation as crucial, particularly for elements like doors, which Kaze described as problematic and dependent on 'quaternion animations' for fixes.","question":"Zeina, Kaze mentioned the critical role of complex animations, like 'quaternion animations,' for core game functionality in RTYI. From an animator's perspective, what are the unique challenges in creating sophisticated animations for a custom engine on the N64, especially for interactive elements that need to be perfectly synced with game logic?"},{"context":"RTYI features new enemy behaviors (like for Chompy) and aims for a dynamic world with elements like hydraulic platforms, all requiring distinct animations.","question":"In a game like RTYI, with custom enemies and dynamic environmental pieces, how do you approach designing animations that not only look fluid and characterful but also feel responsive and integrate seamlessly with the specific gameplay mechanics Kaze is building around them?"},{"context":"RTYI is a passion project pushing the boundaries of what's typically seen in SM64 ROM hacks, demanding a high level of polish and innovation in all areas, including animation.","question":"What has been the most exciting or innovative animation challenge you've tackled for 'Return to Yoshi's Island,' and how does contributing your animation expertise to such a fan-driven, technically ambitious project inspire your creative process?"}]}
