{"kaze":[{"context":"You stated a core design philosophy: 'I feel like there never should be any randomness in Mario's movement... I don't want the player to think about their quarter frames.' This is a significant departure from the original game.","question":"What specific experiences with the original Mario 64 engine led you to this 'no randomness' philosophy, and how do you think creating a perfectly consistent movement system changes the experience for both casual players and hardcore speedrunners?"},{"context":"You mentioned having completely rewritten the game's collision engine to achieve your design goals, a massive technical undertaking.","question":"Take us back to the moment you decided the original collision system wasn't good enough. What was the technical and emotional journey of rewriting such a fundamental part of the game, and how did it feel when it finally worked as intended?"},{"context":"During the stream, you fixed a critical memory crash by creating a secondary 'emergency memory pool.' This highlights a constant battle with the N64's hardware.","question":"Can you talk about wrestling with the N64's limited RAM? How do these strict hardware limitations force you to be more creative in your programming, and can you share another example of a clever workaround you're particularly proud of?"},{"context":"You often pause your development on stream to explain complex technical topics, viewing the process itself as content for your audience.","question":"How does developing this game live in front of an audience influence your process? Does the need to explain your work and 'perform' your problem-solving change how you approach challenges?"},{"context":"You reflected that you find programming easier than the artistic side of development, which is handled primarily by collaborators like Biobak.","question":"How does your self-awareness of your own strengths and weaknesses as a developer shape the way you lead this project and collaborate with artists to achieve a cohesive final product?"},{"context":"This project is an ambitious hack of a beloved classic. You're fixing some things while preserving others.","question":"What is your process for deciding what to 'fix' from the original Mario 64 versus what to preserve? What elements of the original game do you believe are sacred and shouldn't be touched?"}],"biobak":[{"context":"Kaze described a specific creative compromise where he developed a real-time CPU shading solution just to accommodate your desire for detailed vertex colors on a rotating apple. This story perfectly encapsulates the project's dynamic.","question":"Can you walk us through the 'rotating apple' problem from your perspective? What was your artistic goal for that asset, and what does that back-and-forth process with Kaze tell us about how this team reconciles artistic vision with technical limitations?"},{"context":"As the primary 3D artist, you are creating modern assets for very old hardware. The stream shows Kaze actively importing and debugging your work.","question":"What are the biggest challenges in creating a modern, detailed art style that can still function within the strict memory and processing constraints of the Nintendo 64?"},{"context":"Your collaboration with Kaze appears to happen in real-time during his streams.","question":"What is it like to provide assets and see them implemented live on stream, including the immediate discovery and debugging of visual or collision issues that arise?"}],"badub":[{"context":"The stream transcript did not contain specific information about your contributions. This question is to establish your role within the project for the documentary audience.","question":"Could you describe your role on the 'Return to Yoshi's Island' project and what initially drew you to collaborating with Kaze and the team?"},{"context":"ROM hacking projects are passion-driven and collaborative. This question aims to understand the team dynamic from your perspective.","question":"What is the collaborative process like on a large-scale fan project like this? How does the team coordinate and bring together different skills to achieve a unified vision?"}],"zeina":[{"context":"The stream mentioned that some of your earlier models, like the Shy Guy, are now being updated and reworked by Biobak as the project evolves.","question":"Could you tell us about your original contributions to the project? How does it feel to see your work become a foundation that is now being built upon and evolved as the game's art style is further refined?"},{"context":"As a contributor who was involved in the earlier stages, you have a unique perspective on the project's journey.","question":"What were some of the initial artistic goals when you were modeling for the project, and how have you seen the overall vision for 'Return to Yoshi's Island' grow and change over time?"}]}
