{"kaze":[{"context":"You mentioned the project is built on the Mario 64 decompilation and stated, 'this all runs on real hardware. That's the whole point.'","question":"Could you walk us through the 'decompilation revolution'? How has moving away from traditional ROM hacking to the decomp project fundamentally changed the scope and ambition for a game like 'Return to Yoshi's Island' and your philosophy as a creator?"},{"context":"We saw you work through a very specific technical problem live on stream: creating a seamless, 16-color indexed mushroom texture, even explaining a method for 'fake' high-res textures.","question":"You seem to thrive on pushing the N64 to its absolute limits. Can you talk about that balance between your creative vision and the hardware's constraints? How do you turn technical limitations into unique design choices, like the multi-texturing technique you described?"},{"context":"A significant portion of the stream was dedicated to your frustrations with new software versions and your Windows 11 upgrade, which disrupted your established workflow.","question":"As a creator, you're not just fighting the game's code, but also your own tools. How does this constant, frustrating battle with evolving software impact your creative momentum and the overall timeline of a passion project?"},{"context":"The stream showed a live, iterative collaboration with a community member, Zeina, where you gave direct feedback on a texture she provided.","question":"Describe your approach to community collaboration. How does this open, real-time feedback loop with contributors like Zeina and Pixelpalabra shape the game, and how does it differ from a more traditional, closed development process?"},{"context":"You candidly discussed a potential $5000 commission for a ROM hack, while also joking about seeking sponsorships from lawnmower companies.","question":"You're one of the most well-known figures in this scene. What is the reality of monetizing this unique skillset? How do you balance the demands of paid work with the passion that drives a massive free project like 'Return to Yoshi's Island'?"},{"context":"You gave a very clear opinion on AI-generated textures, noting both their technical shortcomings and the 'debuff' from community perception.","question":"Going beyond the technical quality, you mentioned that players will 'hate your game for using AI.' Can you expand on your view of AI's role in creative fields and why you believe maintaining a human-centric creation process is critical for community-driven projects?"}],"biobak":[{"context":"Kaze noted that a new Luigi model was created by another artist specifically in the style of your Mario model. Your artistic direction is becoming a foundational element for the project.","question":"How do you approach designing a character like Mario for a project like this, balancing a new look with the classic N64 feel? What does it feel like to know your style is now setting the standard for other character artists on the project?"},{"context":"The stream mentioned you created the main Mario model for the game, a central asset that defines the player's experience.","question":"When you were creating the Mario model, what were the key technical or artistic limitations of the N64 that you had to work around, and how did those constraints ultimately shape the final design?"}],"badub":[],"zeina":[{"context":"We saw a fascinating moment on stream where Kaze requested a mushroom texture, you provided it, and he then gave you live feedback on how to modify it.","question":"Can you describe what that collaborative process is like from your perspective? What's it like creating an asset and iterating on it in real-time, with the project lead and the entire community watching?"},{"context":"The stream highlighted the specific technical challenge of creating N64-compatible assets, such as a 16-color indexed texture with a proper alpha channel.","question":"As a contributing artist, what are some of the unique hurdles you face when creating art for the N64? How does working with such strict technical limitations influence your creative process?"}]}
