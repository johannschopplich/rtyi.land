{"kaze":[{"context":"You stated in the stream, 'Our task for the day is to make the platforming good. And then after we made the platforming good. We can make the visuals good,' while grey-boxing the Ice Castle.","question":"Kaze, could you elaborate on this 'platforming first' philosophy? How does focusing on mechanics and level flow during the grey-boxing phase, as seen with the Ice Castle, set the foundation for the overall player experience in 'Return to Yoshi's Island' before visual polish?"},{"context":"You often say, 'I think making a game is all about designing a feeling that you want the player to have.' This guided your rejection of some ideas for the Ice Castle area.","question":"For 'Return to Yoshi's Island,' particularly a level like the Ice Castle, what specific 'feeling' are you aiming to evoke in the player, and can you share an example of how this principle led to a key design decision, perhaps in response to a chat suggestion or a new mechanic you were testing?"},{"context":"The stream showed constant consideration for N64 hardware limits, such as when you pondered rendering multiple Marios for the 'mirror Mario' concept or staying within memory limits.","question":"Pushing the N64 with 'Return to Yoshi's Island' must present significant technical hurdles. Can you describe a particularly challenging moment where a desired mechanic or visual for the game clashed with N64 limitations, and how you innovatively navigated that constraint?"},{"context":"We saw you iterate live, fixing an 'impossible jump' and acknowledging camera issues. You also mentioned chat suggesting the 'frozen walls' concept for the Ice Castle.","question":"How significantly does live feedback from your streaming community influence the design and iteration of 'Return to Yoshi's Island'? Could you discuss how this real-time interaction shapes levels like the Ice Castle and helps in problem-solving difficult sections or camera behaviors?"},{"context":"You're aiming for a difficulty 'around vanilla Mario 64' but with 'more consistent controls,' and believe 'the game is as difficult as you are brave.'","question":"How do you strike the balance between this intended difficulty, player agency, and ensuring the controls feel consistently fair in 'Return to Yoshi's Island,' especially when introducing novel mechanics like the momentum jumps or snowball puzzles seen in the Ice Castle development?"},{"context":"Your policy is: 'I released the source code whenever my mods done because if I release it before then I dig my whole mod.' This shows a deliberate approach to your project's release.","question":"Could you expand on your reasoning for withholding the source code of 'Return to Yoshi's Island' until completion? What impact do you believe this has on the initial player experience and the project's integrity, and what are your hopes for its use once released?"},{"context":"You mentioned that 'programming is something you do to build something. The act of it itself should be as simple as possible,' despite the complexity of working with the Mario 64 engine.","question":"How do you apply this philosophy of 'simple and effective programming' when developing advanced features for 'Return to Yoshi's Island' on the N64, and how crucial are tools like the N64 GCC fork by Easy As Pie or Sauron's Trace in achieving this?"}],"biobak":[{"context":"In the stream, Kaze mentioned testing your graphical idea for bottomless pits in the Ice Castle level, showing a direct creative input on level aesthetics.","question":"Biobak, Kaze tested your idea for a bottomless pit effect. Could you walk us through your creative process for designing graphics and textures for 'Return to Yoshi's Island,' especially when balancing artistic vision with the N64's technical limitations and the specific 'feeling' Kaze aims for in levels like the Ice Castle?"},{"context":"Kaze emphasizes a 'platforming first, visuals second' approach, particularly in the 'grey-boxing' stage shown in the stream. This must impact how and when your graphical contributions are integrated.","question":"From your perspective as a graphics artist, how does Kaze's 'gameplay first' philosophy, where he finalizes platforming before detailed visuals, influence your workflow and collaboration on 'Return to Yoshi's Island'? How do you prepare or adapt your designs for this iterative process?"},{"context":"The N64 presents distinct challenges for artists. Kaze frequently discusses rendering and memory limits, as seen with the 'mirror Mario' idea.","question":"What are some of the unique artistic challenges or even surprising advantages you find in creating graphics for a game built on the Mario 64 engine, and how do you collaborate with Kaze to achieve visually appealing results despite hardware constraints like those discussed for the Ice Castle?"}],"badub":[{"context":"This particular stream didn't detail your music contributions, but as the composer for 'Return to Yoshi's Island,' your work is integral to the game's atmosphere.","question":"Badub, could you describe your approach to creating a soundtrack for 'Return to Yoshi's Island' that complements Kaze's vision, especially aiming for a feel reminiscent of vanilla Mario 64 yet with its own unique Yoshi's Island identity?"},{"context":"Composing for the N64 platform involves a unique sound palette and technical constraints, which Kaze often navigates for visuals and mechanics.","question":"What are some of the creative challenges and perhaps unexpected opportunities you encounter when composing music specifically for the N64 hardware for 'Return to Yoshi's Island,' and how do you work within those limitations to create memorable tracks?"}],"zeina":[{"context":"You were greeted in the stream, and your expertise is in animation, a key element for bringing characters and interactions to life.","question":"Zeina, for a project like 'Return to Yoshi's Island' built on the Mario 64 engine, what are the unique challenges and opportunities you face in creating animations that enhance player immersion and the distinct character of the game?"},{"context":"Kaze emphasizes designing for a specific 'feeling' and aims for more consistent and responsive controls than vanilla SM64.","question":"How does your animation work on 'Return to Yoshi's Island' contribute to achieving Kaze's desired 'feeling' and enhancing the game's control responsiveness, especially when integrating new player mechanics or enemy behaviors?"}]}
