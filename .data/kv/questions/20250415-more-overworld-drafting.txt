{"kaze":[{"context":"You've described the original Mario 64 audio engine as 'fucked' and 'dogshit,' and the major refactoring work for 'Return to Yoshi's Island' as something that's 'gonna drive me insane.' This sounds like a monumental undertaking.","question":"Can you walk us through the emotional and technical journey of overhauling the Mario 64 audio engine? What specific moment or discovery made you realize 'this whole thing is fucked,' and what tangible improvements do you hope players will experience with the new audio system?"},{"context":"You mentioned the overworld is in a 'drafting phase,' focusing on events and secret stars to make it feel alive, with events having permanent effects. You even joked about potentially putting '40 secret stars in your world.'","question":"How do you approach designing these overworld events and secret stars to create a world that feels genuinely dynamic and reactive, rather than just a checklist of tasks? What's your philosophy on balancing the density of content with the joy of player discovery?"},{"context":"You’ve stated, 'I Know it is tempting to look at the game you're making and to be like Let's throw in every cool mechanic that I know of But I don't think that gets you a good game,' indicating a very deliberate design philosophy.","question":"'Return to Yoshi's Island' leverages the expansive possibilities of the decompilation project.

And then instead of a romhack, I will release a video game.'","question":"How does the ever-present shadow of potential Nintendo intervention influence your creative process, project scope, and long-term ambitions for projects like 'Return to Yoshi's Island'? Does this reality restrict your design choices, or does it perhaps fuel a certain kind of innovative or rebellious creativity?"},{"context":"You're currently tracking a particularly elusive bug that only manifests after the N64 has been running for six and a half days, and you're aiming for around 180-200 stars, noting it's 'easy to add more lower-quality secret stars.'","question":"Between wrestling with extreme technical challenges like the 6.5-day bug and making crucial scope decisions like the final star count, what does 'finished' truly look like for 'Return to Yoshi's Island'? How do you determine when the game has reached a point of quality and completeness that satisfies your artistic vision?"},{"context":"You mentioned an interesting design choice where characters from levels, like Boshi, might reappear in the overworld with new dialogues or even character arcs after their respective levels are completed.","question":"This idea of evolving characters and a persistent world suggests a narrative depth not always seen in Mario fan projects. What inspired this approach, and how do you hope these persistent character elements will enrich the player's connection to the world and its inhabitants in 'Return to Yoshi's Island'?"}],"biobak":[{"context":"Kaze mentioned that the team is 'waiting for Biobak to finish level reworks' as a key remaining task and specifically discussed ideas with you for a 'conspiracy Yoshi house level' which you had apparently made, and a potential 'Bowser's yacht' bonus level.","question":"Could you tell us about your role in the 'level reworks' for 'Return to Yoshi's Island'?

How do you collaborate with Kaze to ensure the music and sounds enhance the specific atmosphere and events he's designing for each area of 'Return to Yoshi's Island'?"},{"context":"The stream highlighted that the overworld music in 'Return to Yoshi's Island' is designed to 'fade into each other seamlessly when moving between areas,' which is a significant technical and artistic challenge for a score involving nearly 20 tracks.","question":"What were the main challenges you faced in creating an overworld score where so many distinct musical pieces can transition seamlessly? How do you approach composing individual tracks that also need to function as part of a larger, interconnected and evolving soundscape?"}],"zeina":[{"context":"Kaze highlighted your detailed work, stating, 'One area in Course 13 missing because Zeyna wanted to work on it. And she has been putting a lot of detail on there.' He also mentioned you work on animations.","question":"Kaze spoke about the significant detail you're adding to a specific area in Course 13.
