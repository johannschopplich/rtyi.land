Can you elaborate on what aspects of this project feel so monumental, and what drives you to keep climbing despite such immense challenges?"},{"context":"The stream highlighted a design pivot for the Raven enemy, influenced by Biobank’s suggestion to have them pop out of the ground, which you adopted for being \"cooler and easier to program.\"","question":"The Raven enemy's design evolved significantly during the stream, partly due to community feedback. Can you discuss how you balance your initial vision for elements like enemies or levels with spontaneous ideas from collaborators or your community, and how this impacts the development process?"},{"context":"You're considering changes to the dive jump based on feedback from Dan Salvato, who felt it was \"against the design of Mario 64.\"","question":"You received feedback from Dan Salvato about the dive jump potentially deviating from Mario 64's core design. How do you approach integrating feedback that challenges existing mechanics, especially when trying to innovate within the framework of a beloved classic?"},{"context":"You mentioned a new HUD rendering system saving \"precious microseconds\" and an idea for frame buffer optimization to gain a full FPS.","question":"You're clearly very focused on performance, discussing optimizations down to the microsecond. For a project built on the SM64 decompilation, what are the unique technical hurdles and satisfactions of pushing the N64 to its limits for 'Return to Yoshi's Island'?"},{"context":"You stated, \"To me, games is about experiencing new ideas and concepts,\" contrasting this with ROM hacks that feel \"very samey.\"","question":"You prioritize games offering 'new ideas and concepts.' How does this philosophy specifically shape 'Return to Yoshi's Island,' and what distinct experiences or novel concepts are you most excited for players to discover in this game?"},{"context":"The stream showed you designing the Raven enemy, working on its model, programming its behavior, and fixing bugs live, while also managing work from Zeina and integrating code from Michi Michi.","question":"Viewers see you deeply involved in all aspects of development, from coding new enemy AI to tweaking models and discussing music direction. How do you manage these diverse roles and oversee contributions from collaborators like Zeina, Biobak, and Badub on such a long-term, ambitious project?"}],"biobak":[{"context":"During the stream, Kaze adopted your suggestion for the Raven enemy to pop out of the ground, calling it \"cooler and easier to program.\"","question":"Biobak, Kaze implemented your idea for the Raven enemy's behavior almost immediately during the stream. Can you tell us about the thought process behind your suggestion and how it feels to see your creative input directly shape an enemy's design in 'Return to Yoshi's Island'?"},{"context":"As a graphics artist for RTUI, you contribute to the game's visual identity. The Raven enemy, for example, was decided to be made of ice, as discussed in the stream.","question":"The Raven enemy in the ice level is made of ice. From a graphics artist's perspective, what are the unique challenges and opportunities in creating assets for a game like 'Return to Yoshi's Island' that aims for a specific aesthetic on the N64 platform, while also introducing new visual elements like these ice creatures?"}],"badub":[{"context":"Kaze mentioned on stream his role as \"music director,\" giving \"directions\" for the music and discussing OST choices for 'Return to Yoshi's Island.'","question":"Badub, Kaze described himself as a 'music director' providing direction for the game's soundtrack. Can you describe your collaborative process with Kaze in composing the music for 'Return to Yoshi's Island'? How do you translate his vision and the game's atmosphere into the score?"},{"context":"'Return to Yoshi's Island' aims to evoke a certain feeling, building on the Mario 64 legacy while introducing new themes and levels, like the surreal ice palace mentioned in the stream.","question":"What are your main musical inspirations for 'Return to Yoshi's Island,' and how do you approach creating a soundtrack that feels both nostalgic to the Mario 64 era and fresh for the new experiences Kaze is building, such as for the unique level environments he designs?"}],"zeina":[{"context":"Kaze was working with the Raven model you provided during the stream, discussing its animations like the \"dilly dally\" and addressing texture/orientation details.","question":"Zeina, we saw Kaze integrating your Raven model and animations into the game. Could you share some insight into your creative process for designing and animating characters like the Raven for 'Return to Yoshi's Island,' and how you collaborate with Kaze to bring these models to life in the N64 engine?"},{"context":"During the stream, there was discussion about the Raven's material, with Kaze and yourself (via chat comments attributed to 'Lena'/'Zeyna') deciding on an ice appearance and specific colors for its beak and feet.","question":"There was a specific discussion during the stream about the Raven's visual details, like its ice material and your input on the color of its beak and feet. How do you and Kaze typically iterate on the visual appearance of characters and ensure they fit the artistic style of the game and the N64's capabilities?"},{"context":"Kaze mentioned a \"dilly dally\" animation for the Raven, which you reportedly created.","question":"Creating animations that convey personality and behavior for N64 models has its unique challenges. Can you talk about how you approach character animation for 'Return to Yoshi's Island,' perhaps using the Raven's 'dilly dally' animation as an example, to make them feel dynamic and engaging within the game's world?"}]}
