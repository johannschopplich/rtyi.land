{"kaze":[{"context":"The stream showcased the rapid development of the 'soap bar' mechanic, initially termed 'soul bar,' which you programmed 'just today' with unique shrinking and cleaning properties.","question":"On stream, you developed the 'soap bar' mechanic from concept to a functional element within a single session. Can you walk us through the creative spark for this unique rideable, shrinking platform and the key challenges you faced in making it 'feel' right, especially its interaction with the oil slicks?"},{"context":"You discussed moving towards 3D panoramas for the star select screen for 'Return to Yoshi's Island,' citing ROM space and visual quality, and mentioned Biobak provided a compelling mockup.","question":"The new star select screen aims for 3D panoramas to give each level a 'vibe.' You mentioned Biobak provided a mockup that you preferred. Could you elaborate on the decision-making process for this UI element, the technical trade-offs you weighed, and how Biobak's input helped shape its final vision?"},{"context":"You emphasized that 'adding visual flare is important to the game' and demonstrated this by creating custom particle effects for soap bubbles, even building your own particle engine for efficiency.","question":"You've stated that 'visual flare' is crucial for a game to feel complete. Could you discuss your philosophy on visual aesthetics in ROM hacking and why you often opt to create custom solutions, like your particle engine for the soap bubbles, to achieve your specific vision on the N64?"},{"context":"The stream showed constant consideration for N64 limitations (ROM space, performance), like removing MK64 backgrounds, while implementing complex features like the dynamic soap bar.","question":"'Return to Yoshi's Island' is pushing new mechanics and visual effects. How do you navigate the balance between your ambitious creative goals for features like the soap bar and oil slicks, and the inherent hardware constraints of the N64 and the SM64 engine?"},{"context":"You confidently stated, 'See, I have never seen Anon's idea... that means I didn't steal it,' highlighting your focus on originality, while also being open to community interaction and ideas from collaborators like Biobak.","question":"You place a high value on originality in your work. How do you foster your own unique ideas for 'Return to Yoshi's Island' while also engaging with, and sometimes integrating, feedback or concepts from your collaborators and the wider community during development?"},{"context":"The project is titled 'Return to Yoshi's Island,' and the stream alluded to an 'island rescue' theme and potential dynamic overworld elements like returning water levels.","question":"What was the initial inspiration behind the 'Return to Yoshi's Island' concept and title? Could you elaborate on the core vision for this game, how the Yoshi's Island IP influences its design, and any plans for the 'island rescue' narrative or thematic elements you mentioned?"}],"biobak":[{"context":"Kaze mentioned on stream that you provided 'pretty cool ideas' and a preferred mockup for the new 3D panorama star select screen in 'Return to Yoshi's Island,' which he favored for its 'vibe.'","question":"Kaze highlighted your mockup for the new star select screen as influential. Can you describe your creative process for conceptualizing these 3D panoramas and how you collaborate with Kaze to translate visual ideas into tangible, atmospheric elements within the game?"},{"context":"During the stream, Kaze was actively implementing your specific request for soap bubble particles to fade to white, demonstrating a close collaboration on visual details.","question":"Kaze mentioned he was working to realize specific particle effect details you requested, like soap bubbles fading to white. What's your approach to designing these nuanced visual details, and how do you and Kaze iterate together to achieve the desired aesthetic for effects within the N64's technical constraints?"},{"context":"The stream suggested you are a significant contributor to the overall visual design and 'flare' of 'Return to Yoshi's Island,' beyond individual features.","question":"Beyond specific elements like the star select screen or particle effects, how would you describe your overall role in shaping the visual identity of 'Return to Yoshi's Island,' and what unique challenges or artistic opportunities do you find in designing for an SM64 ROM hack like this?"}],"badub":[{"context":"While the August 12th stream didn't detail your specific contributions to 'Return to Yoshi's Island,' you are known as a core contributor to Kaze's projects.","question":"Although not extensively discussed in the August 12th stream, you're a key collaborator on Kaze's projects. Could you share some insights into your general role and contributions to 'Return to Yoshi's Island,' perhaps in areas not covered that day, or how your collaboration with Kaze typically functions on these ambitious hacks?"}],"zeina":[{"context":"Kaze mentioned you were 'at work' during the August 12th stream, implying your connection to the development circle for 'Return to Yoshi's Island,' though specifics of your role weren't detailed that day.","question":"You were mentioned during Kaze's stream as being part of his development circle. While your specific contributions to 'Return to Yoshi's Island' weren't detailed on that particular day, could you tell us about your involvement in the project or how you generally support Kaze's ambitious ROM hacking endeavors?"}]}
