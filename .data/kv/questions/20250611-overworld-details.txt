{"kaze":[{"context":"The stream notes your ambitious plan for a single, large, dynamically loading overworld to ensure seamless views of major landmarks like the central tree.","question":"You mentioned wanting the overworld to be one large, dynamic level. Can you walk us through the creative vision behind that decision and the unique technical hurdles you face implementing such a feature on original N64 hardware?"},{"context":"We learned that Luigi's model has been successfully imported into the game, with his exact role still being decided between co-op or a single-player unlock.","question":"Luigi is now in the game, which is a huge addition. Was this part of the original vision, or a more recent idea? Could you elaborate on the 'coolest option' of co-op and what it would take, both technically and from a design perspective, to make that a reality?"},{"context":"During the stream, you spent a significant amount of time troubleshooting issues with Blender, even switching to a custom renderer mid-stream. This frustration with tools seems to be a recurring theme.","question":"You're often seen battling your creative tools as much as you are building the game. How does this tension between needing advanced tools and dealing with their instability affect your creative process and motivation on a day-to-day basis?"},{"context":"Your on-stream dynamic with contributors like Lila is incredibly candid, with one moment ending in the realization, 'Wait, maybe Leela was right.'","question":"What does that chaotic but ultimately productive collaboration look like behind the scenes? How do you navigate creative disagreements and technical problem-solving in real-time with a remote team on a project of this scale?"},{"context":"The game is approaching its 64MB limit, and you've set a tentative goal for the end of the year. Yet, there's still a lot of bug-fixing and side content ahead.","question":"With the project in its final stages, you're shifting from creating major courses to connecting the world and fixing small, persistent bugs. How do you maintain focus and momentum when the work becomes less about grand creation and more about polish and perfection?"},{"context":"You frequently emphasize that the game is being designed for and tested on original N64 hardware, a detail that seems core to your development philosophy.","question":"Why is it so important for you that 'Return to Yoshi's Island' runs authentically on the N64? What does that commitment add to the project, and what creative sacrifices, if any, have you had to make to honor those hardware limitations?"}],"biobak":[],"badub":[],"zeina":[]}
