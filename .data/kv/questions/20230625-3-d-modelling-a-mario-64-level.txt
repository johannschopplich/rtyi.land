{"kaze":[{"context":"You mentioned in the stream, 'my bar is usually when I watch the player and it's painful to watch them I need to make it easier,' referring specifically to watching Zayna playtest.","question":"Kaze, you've said your difficulty bar is set when it becomes 'painful to watch' a player. Could you elaborate on this philosophy? How does observing playtesters like Zayna directly shape your design decisions, and can you give an example beyond the water penalty where this fundamentally changed a feature?"},{"context":"You made a significant design pivot, scrapping player skins in favor of letting players buy items for 'Mario's house.'","question":"You announced a notable shift from player skins to a 'Mario's house' customization feature. What was the catalyst for this change, and how does this new system better align with your vision for player engagement in 'Return to Yoshi's Island'?"},{"context":"The stream highlighted the technical hurdles with the 'cement pit' footprints, leading to the solution of 'circular' footprints due to N64 limitations.","question":"The cement pit with persistent footprints sounds like a complex feature for the N64. You mentioned the challenge of rotating footprint images. Can you walk us through the problem-solving process for such ambitious mechanics on old hardware, and how do you balance innovation with the N64's constraints?"},{"context":"You critically referred to a level's aesthetic as 'color vomit' and are willing to overhaul visuals.","question":"You have a strong aesthetic vision, even calling a level 'color vomit' and expressing willingness to iterate. How do you approach the visual identity of 'Return to Yoshi's Island,' and what's your process for working with artists like Biobak to achieve the look you're aiming for?"},{"context":"You mentioned the project is '71.8%' complete but also a discrepancy in your star count. You also spoke about pushing the N64's capabilities, saying, 'Man, this is so much work for just a single stupid star.'","question":"You've described 'Return to Yoshi's Island' as being over 70% complete, yet you also detail the immense effort for individual elements like a 'single stupid star.' What keeps you motivated to push the N64 to its limits for this project, and what does 'completion' ultimately look like for you?"},{"context":"The stream mentions new level themes like 'Oily Boily Bay' and detailed NPC brainstorming (construction Koopas, Thwomps with vests, a Wiggler overseer).","question":"We heard about plans for 'Oily Boily Bay' and some creative NPC concepts like builder Koopas and an emotional Wiggler overseer. How do you approach world-building and character design for a new level to make it feel unique and memorable within the Mario 64 framework?"},{"context":"You mentioned considering an updated demo release for the original three levels with improvements.","question":"You've talked about possibly releasing an updated demo. How does community feedback from demos or your streams influence the ongoing development of 'Return to Yoshi's Island,' and what role do these releases play in your development cycle?"}],"biobak":[{"context":"The stream mentions you're actively involved in modeling and texturing, with Kaze referring to discussions about a skybox and brick colors, and you providing a 'cool water texture.'","question":"Biobak, Kaze described a collaborative process where he'd discuss aesthetics with you, like the skybox or brick colors for a level. Can you walk us through how you and Kaze typically iterate on the visual design for a level in 'Return to Yoshi's Island'?"},{"context":"Kaze mentioned dissatisfaction with some early level aesthetics, even calling one 'color vomit.' As a graphics artist, how do you approach the challenge of creating visually appealing levels that also fit the N64's technical constraints and Kaze's overall vision?","question":"When Kaze expresses strong opinions about a level's visuals, perhaps calling something 'color vomit,' how do you as the graphics artist interpret that feedback and what's your process for refining or overhauling those visuals to meet both his and your artistic standards?"},{"context":"The N64 has significant limitations. Kaze often talks about workarounds for visual effects.","question":"From your perspective as a graphics artist, what are some of the most interesting or rewarding challenges you've faced in creating textures and models that push the N64's capabilities for 'Return to Yoshi's Island'?"}],"badub":[],"zeina":[{"context":"Kaze mentioned that your playtesting was 'very painful to watch' at one point, leading him to adjust difficulty, such as the penalty for falling in water.","question":"Zeina, Kaze highlighted how your playtesting experiences, sometimes 'painful to watch' for him, directly led to design changes like reducing the penalty for falling in water. Can you share your perspective on playtesting 'Return to Yoshi's Island' and how your feedback loop with Kaze works?"},{"context":"You provided the 2D pixel art footprint textures for the complex cement pit mechanic, with Kaze noting he relies on you for art he 'can't draw.'","question":"Kaze specifically credited you with creating the footprint textures for the new cement pit mechanic, an area where he said he needed your artistic skills. Could you describe your creative process for developing these assets and how you collaborate with Kaze on integrating your 2D art into the 3D world of Mario 64?"},{"context":"You're involved in both providing art assets and playtesting the game, giving you a unique perspective on its development.","question":"As someone who contributes art like the footprints and also playtests the game, how does your experience on one side of development inform your contributions or understanding of the other? Does playtesting influence your artistic choices, or vice-versa?"}]}
