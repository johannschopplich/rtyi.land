{"kaze":[{"context":"You've mentioned a philosophy of 'spending four hours sharpening the axe' before cutting down the tree, which you applied to preparing tools and knowledge for this project.","question":"Can you give a concrete example from 'Return to Yoshi's Island' where investing significant time into tools or knowledge beforehand allowed you to overcome a major development hurdle or unlock new creative possibilities?"},{"context":"The stream detailed a significant design change for the game's opening, moving from a 10-coin requirement to a dynamic cutscene where a Napi-Nut destroys the player's boat.","question":"What does that design evolution tell us about your priorities for the player's first fifteen minutes? What specific feelings or information are you trying to convey with this new, more dramatic introduction?"},{"context":"You're seriously considering a split-screen multiplayer mode, even acknowledging it might run at a challenging 20 FPS on original hardware.","question":"What makes this ambitious feature so important to you that you're willing to tackle major technical hurdles and potentially compromise on performance? What kind of player experience are you hoping to create with multiplayer that a single-player mode can't achieve?"},{"context":"The game's total star count has grown from a planned 185 to potentially 200, a classic example of 'scope creep'.","question":"How do you decide when a new idea is worth expanding the project's scope, versus when you need to stick to the plan to get the game finished? Is there a 'final' vision for the game, or is it a more organic, evolving creation?"},{"context":"You mentioned being careful not to interfere with Biobak's work-in-progress on a level.","question":"How do you balance your role as project lead with giving your collaborators, like Biobak and Zeina, the creative freedom to interpret the 'Yoshi's Island' aesthetic in their own way? How is that trust built in a remote team?"},{"context":"Your analysis of 'The Tortoise and the Hare' reveals a very logical, perhaps contrarian, way of looking at classic stories and problems.","question":"How does this unique, logic-driven perspective influence your game design decisions? Do you find it helps you identify and solve problems that other developers might not see?"},{"context":"You described an enemy model looking 'like an enemy from a Yoshi game' as a high compliment and a core goal of the project.","question":"This game is a hack of Mario 64, but an homage to a 2D game. What are the key elements you and your team focus on to translate the unique, hand-drawn aesthetic of the original Yoshi's Island into a 3D N64 environment?"}],"biobak":[{"context":"Kaze mentioned on stream that you were reworking a stage to function as a 'smaller mission.'","question":"Can you walk us through your creative process for that? When you're tasked with redesigning a level, how do you balance the original concept with the new requirements while still ensuring it fits the overall 'Yoshi's Island' feel?"},{"context":"Kaze has a clear vision for the game's aesthetic, but also mentioned he's careful not to interfere with your work-in-progress.","question":"From your perspective as a level designer and artist, how does that collaboration work? How do you interpret the project's aesthetic goals and apply them to your designs, and how much freedom do you have to experiment and pitch your own ideas?"},{"context":"The project aims to capture the spirit of a 2D, storybook-style game inside a 3D engine from a different franchise.","question":"What are the biggest challenges and rewards for you as a graphics artist in translating the very specific, hand-drawn aesthetic of Yoshi's Island into the polygons and textures of the Nintendo 64?"}],"badub":[],"zeina":[{"context":"In a recent stream, Kaze mentioned you were working on an animation for a 'ball breaking scene.'","question":"Without spoiling too much, can you describe your process for bringing a specific moment like that to life? How do you translate a simple description into a fluid animation that fits the playful, cartoonish style of the Yoshi's Island universe?"},{"context":"The project is a unique blend of Mario 64's engine and Yoshi's Island's distinct character and enemy designs.","question":"As an animator, how do you approach creating movement for these characters? Do you draw more inspiration from the bouncy, expressive animations of the 2D Yoshi's Island, or the more physics-based movement of Mario 64?"},{"context":"You're contributing a key visual element—animation—to a large, collaborative fan project.","question":"What is the workflow like for you? How do you receive a task, what assets do you work with, and how do you iterate on an animation based on feedback from Kaze or others to get to the final version?"}]}
