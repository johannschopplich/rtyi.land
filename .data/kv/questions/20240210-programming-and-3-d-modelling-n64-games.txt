{"kaze":[{"context":"You expressed strong feelings about the original Mario 64 collision system, calling it 'unusable' and taking on the significant task of building a completely new one for 'Return to Yoshi's Island.'","question":"Can you walk us through the specific breaking points you encountered with the original SM64 collision system that made you decide such a fundamental overhaul was necessary? What were the biggest challenges in developing your custom system, and what new gameplay possibilities has it unlocked?"},{"context":"You have a nuanced philosophy on bugs, aiming to fix those that occur accidentally but potentially keeping intentional ones like BLJ, which your new collision system initially removed.","question":"Could you elaborate on this philosophy? How do you balance preserving beloved emergent mechanics like BLJ with the goal of creating a more stable game, and what was the thought process behind trying to re-enable BLJ after your new physics system initially removed it?"},{"context":"The stream showed you working through complex projectile physics for the Monty Moles, even trying ChatGPT before solving it with manual equations.","question":"Can you describe the problem-solving journey you went on to get the Monty Mole's rock projectiles working correctly? What's the feeling when you finally crack a tough technical challenge like that, and how often do these deep dives into physics or math occur in the project?"},{"context":"You mentioned that when addressing player critique, you try to understand 'what the person was feeling that's wrong' rather than just their literal feedback.","question":"Could you share an example from 'Return to Yoshi's Island' where you interpreted the underlying 'feeling' of a critique to arrive at a design solution that perhaps differed from the initial suggestion, and how did that improve the player experience?"},{"context":"You discussed iterating on the Monty Mole boss fight for the 'cowboy level,' moving from initial ideas to the current design of moles popping from random holes, while also considering thematic elements like disliking hard hats for a cowboy level.","question":"What is your creative process for designing a boss encounter like the one for the Monty Moles? How do you balance mechanical complexity, thematic consistency, player engagement, and the technical limitations of the N64, like RAM management which you mentioned for that level?"},{"context":"You've stated the game is about 80% complete and have plans for an original commercial game funded via Kickstarter after its release.","question":"As 'Return to Yoshi's Island' nears completion, what are the most significant hurdles remaining for the final 20%? And looking beyond this project, what key lessons from developing such an ambitious ROM hack do you feel will be most crucial for your transition into commercial game development?"}],"biobak":[],"badub":[],"zeina":[{"context":"Kaze mentioned that for the Monty Moles, he 'need[s] the animations' to 'effectively make this faster,' implying your work is crucial for his development flow.","question":"Kaze highlighted that your animations are often needed before he can fully implement or refine enemy behaviors. Can you describe your collaborative process with him? How do you translate his gameplay ideas into animations, and how does your work directly enable or speed up his level and enemy design?"},{"context":"Animating for a retro console like the N64 within a ROM hack has its own unique set of challenges, and there was a playful mention of 'quaternion animations.'","question":"What are some of the unique creative and technical challenges you face when creating animations for 'Return to Yoshi's Island' within the constraints of the Mario 64 engine? Could you perhaps shed some light on what 'quaternion animations' entail and why they might be a notable task?"},{"context":"Your animation work significantly contributes to the overall polish and character of the game.","question":"When you're tasked with animating a new character or enemy for 'Return to Yoshi's Island,' what are your primary goals in terms of conveying personality and enhancing gameplay? How do you ensure your animations not only look good but also support the feel and mechanics Kaze is building?"}]}
