Could you walk us through the emotional or experiential impact you're hoping this seamlessness will have on players, and how you're navigating the significant technical trade-offs to bring that vision to life within the SM64 engine?"},{"context":"You stated, 'Yes, the old hub sucked, I'm making a completely new one. It's much better to decide on a hub in post... you need to make it with all the information available to you.'","question":"You've described redesigning the hub world 'in post' as crucial. What specific information or understanding gleaned from the completed courses becomes vital in shaping a truly effective hub, and how does this philosophy influence its connection to the rest of the game world?"},{"context":"You aim for 'cool experiences,' like the player reaching the lighthouse after a long journey ('And I think that's gonna be a really cool experience'), and mentioned the 'suspense treadmill' concept.","question":"You've talked about crafting specific player experiences, like the satisfaction of reaching the lighthouse, and using concepts like the 'suspense treadmill.' How do you balance intentionally guiding players towards these impactful moments with fostering a sense of genuine, unscripted discovery within the expansive overworld you're building?"},{"context":"You humorously noted the game 'looks like dark shit because we don't do the visuals until it's done because we still make a lot of changes.'","question":"Your development philosophy prioritizes gameplay functionality over early visual polish, famously saying early builds are 'supposed to look like dog shit.' Can you elaborate on how this iterative approach benefits the creative process, especially in a collaborative project, and at what point do you decide it's time to focus on bringing in the final visual elements?"},{"context":"You expressed a hope to 'make like a legally distinct version of this as well,' while also acknowledging the legal realities of ROM hacking ('I can't release the game physically').","question":"Looking beyond 'Return to Yoshi's Island,' you've hinted at ambitions for a 'legally distinct version.'

How do you balance preserving Kaze's initial structure with injecting your own creative vision, and how does your collaboration with Kaze typically unfold when tackling these redesigns?"},{"context":"Kaze specifically sought your input on fast travel alternatives ('Okay, Biobank, if you don't want pipes as fast travel, what would you like?'), indicating your influence on game mechanics.","question":"The stream touched upon a design discussion about fast travel, with Kaze seeking your input. From your perspective as a level designer and key collaborator, what are the most important considerations when implementing player convenience features like fast travel in a game that also emphasizes discovery and a meticulously crafted, interconnected world?"},{"context":"Kaze's development philosophy is that early visuals are secondary to functionality ('it looks like dark shit because we don't do the visuals until it's done'). As someone working on level reworks, this impacts your process.","question":"Kaze often jokes about the game's early, unpolished visuals. As someone deeply involved in reworking levels, which ultimately blend structure and aesthetics, how does this 'functionality first, visuals later' approach impact your design process?
