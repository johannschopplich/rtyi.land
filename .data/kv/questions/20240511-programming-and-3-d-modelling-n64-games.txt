{"kaze":[{"context":"You mentioned completing a new custom N64 OS, stating 'Did I tell you guys that I wrote a new OS for my N64? It's all done now, it's all good... And it gives me a lot more control.'","question":"You've recently completed a new custom N64 Operating System. Could you walk us through the journey of that decision – what were the key limitations of the existing tools that pushed you to undertake such a massive task, and what new possibilities do you feel this OS unlocks for 'Return to Yoshi's Island' and your future N64 projects?"},{"context":"You described the ice castle's intended atmosphere: 'The idea here is, it's kind of like an eerie ice castle... Kind of a lonely world for Mario, with a lot of enemies. Some more hardcore platforming. So, this is more like, you know, this is the late end of the game.'","question":"The ice castle aims for an 'eerie' and 'lonely' late-game feel. How do you translate these atmospheric goals into concrete level design choices, from the layout and enemy placement to the specific mechanics like the 'cold haze rooms' or 'appearing paths'?"},{"context":"You're working on advanced N64 graphical techniques like CPU-generated normal maps, while also battling issues like texture quantization, which you said, 'Quantization really fucked us over. Holy shit...'","question":"You're implementing advanced graphical techniques like CPU-generated normal maps for ice reflections on the N64, which you noted is 'expensive.' What drives you to push these technical boundaries on such constrained hardware, and can you share a moment during this process where a particularly challenging technical hurdle led to an unexpected creative solution or breakthrough?"},{"context":"You have a specific design philosophy for creating labyrinthine areas that feel 'confusing, but not frustrating.'","question":"You have a design philosophy of creating labyrinthine areas that are 'confusing, but not frustrating.' What's the secret to striking that delicate balance, especially in a 3D space, to ensure players feel challenged and intrigued rather than just lost and annoyed?"},{"context":"You strongly stated your intention to release the source code: 'Yes the source code will release. Despite what people seem to think I will release the source code.'","question":"You've strongly affirmed your intention to release the source code for 'Return to Yoshi's Island.' What does open-source mean to you personally, and what impact do you hope making your work publicly available will have on the wider Mario 64 modding and N64 homebrew community?"},{"context":"The stream highlighted your collaboration with Biobak on art style ('I was working with Biobak off-stream') and Zeina on assets ('Oh, Zena's making the raven. That looks pretty nice.').","question":"Collaboration is key to a project of this scale. Could you describe your creative process when working with Biobak on the art style or Zeina on assets like the raven? How do you ensure their contributions align with your overall vision while also allowing their individual creativity to shine?"}],"biobak":[{"context":"Kaze mentioned you've been actively working together off-stream to define the art style for the ice castle, with both of you contributing 'neat ideas.' He specifically said, 'As I was saying, I was working with Biobak off-stream to try and find an art style for this. We were working very actively. But he had some neat ideas and I had some neat ideas.'","question":"Kaze described your collaboration on the ice castle's art style as a very active process with both of you bringing 'neat ideas' to the table. Could you share your perspective on this collaborative process? How do you and Kaze typically iterate on visual concepts to arrive at a style that fits the N64's aesthetic and the level's 'eerie' atmosphere?"},{"context":"The stream highlighted significant technical and artistic challenges, such as N64 texture quantization ('Quantization really fucked us over') and the desire for realistic ice effects within hardware limits.","question":"The N64 presents unique artistic challenges, like texture quantization and limited color palettes. From your perspective as a graphics artist, how do you approach creating compelling and atmospheric visuals for the ice castle, especially for elements like ice effects, within these technical constraints?"},{"context":"Kaze emphasizes the 'eerie,' 'lonely,' and 'late-game' vision for the ice castle and values your understanding of this aesthetic.","question":"When Kaze describes the 'eerie,' 'lonely,' and 'late-game' vision for the ice castle, what kind of imagery, textures, or visual motifs does that evoke for you, and how do you translate that feeling into the actual graphical assets you create for the level?"}],"badub":[],"zeina":[{"context":"Kaze mentioned you created the 'icy bricks combiner' asset and are working on the 'raven' enemy, saying, 'Oh, Zena's making the raven. That looks pretty nice. I like this.'","question":"We saw Kaze react positively to your work on the raven enemy for the ice castle, and he mentioned your 'icy bricks combiner' asset. When you're tasked with creating a specific asset or enemy like the raven, what's your creative process from concept to a model or animation that fits the N64 aesthetic and the game's needs?"},{"context":"Your contributions, like the raven and icy bricks, directly impact the gameplay and visual identity of the level, which is described as 'eerie' and 'lonely'.","question":"Your 3D assets and animations, such as the raven enemy or the 'icy bricks combiner,' play a crucial role in bringing the ice castle to life. How do you approach designing these elements to not only look good within the N64's limitations but also to support the intended gameplay mechanics and the overall 'eerie' atmosphere of the level?"},{"context":"The stream indicates Kaze reviews and provides feedback on your contributions as part of the iterative development process.","question":"Kaze often reviews and provides feedback on your assets. Can you describe what that feedback loop looks like? How does Kaze's input help refine your animations and models, and how do you balance his vision with your own creative interpretations for characters like the raven?"}]}
