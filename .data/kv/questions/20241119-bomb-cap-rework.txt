I want something else.') and works very closely with Biobak on specific visual elements, indicating a hands-on approach to quality control.","question":"Your streams reveal a very direct and deeply involved approach, whether it's giving pointed feedback on music potentially from Badub or meticulously discussing graphical details with Biobak. Could you describe what your ideal collaborative dynamic looks like? How do you foster both creativity and high standards across diverse contributions like music and graphics when leading your team?"}],"biobak":[{"context":"Kaze mentioned waiting for Biobak's 'reworks' before adding final VFX/SFX and specifically discussed 'the biomex rework of the stage' and missing textures in 'factorycanon.blend.'","question":"Biobak, Kaze mentioned he's often coordinating his final polish, like VFX and SFX, around the completion of your graphical 'reworks,' such as the 'biomex rework of the stage.' Could you describe your process for these significant visual overhauls, and how do you and Kaze collaborate to ensure your artistic vision aligns with his technical implementation and the overall feel of 'Return to Yoshi's Island'?"},{"context":"Kaze consulted Biobak on a 'bombable wall' texture and discussed Biobak's decision to remove 'wall gears,' showing a collaborative design process for environmental details.","question":"The stream highlighted detailed discussions between you and Kaze about specific environmental elements, like the texture for a 'bombable wall' or the decision regarding 'wall gears.' Can you walk us through an example of how a visual or design idea for a level element evolves through your collaboration, from an initial concept to what players will eventually see and interact with in-game?"},{"context":"Kaze mentioned 'textures missing in the factorycanon.blend file' and 'the multex just still messed up,' indicating ongoing detailed texture work.","question":"Creating visuals for a project built on the Mario 64 engine presents unique challenges and opportunities. Kaze touched upon some ongoing texture work, like missing textures or specific shader issues. What are some of the key artistic or technical considerations you navigate when developing new graphical assets that must fit within the SM64 engine while still feeling fresh and significantly enhancing the 'Return to Yoshi's Island' experience?"}],"badub":[{"context":"Kaze solicited 'OST wishes' and critiqued some game music on stream, indicating music is an active area of development or selection.","question":"Badub, during a recent stream, Kaze was actively seeking 'OST wishes' and even critiqued some existing music, showing that the soundtrack is a key focus for 'Return to Yoshi's Island.' Could you describe your approach to composing or curating music for this project? How do you aim to capture the game's unique atmosphere while still evoking the spirit of the Yoshi's Island and Mario 64 lineage?"},{"context":"Kaze's quote 'Fuck whoever composed this. I want something else' was a direct critique, highlighting the iterative nature of music selection or creation for the game.","question":"Kaze's stream showed he has strong opinions on the music, even offering some blunt critiques.
