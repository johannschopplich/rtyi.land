{"kaze":[{"context":"You described a core design philosophy that 'the purpose of any art piece really is to make you feel something' and contrasted this with games you find 'soulless.'","question":"What is the specific feeling you want players to experience in 'Return to Yoshi's Island,' and how are you using the world design, characters, and gameplay to evoke that specific emotion?"},{"context":"During the stream, you brainstormed a quest where a bully gives up his old ways to pursue a dream of becoming a singer, resulting in a rhythm minigame.","question":"Can you walk us through that creative journey? What does that specific evolution—from a simple boss fight to a character with a new dream—say about your overall approach to designing quests for the overworld?"},{"context":"A central, guiding principle for the project is that 'The island goes through permanent change as you're on it,' with events like a volcano eruption permanently altering the landscape.","question":"Where did this 'living world' concept come from? What are the biggest technical and design challenges in creating a world that evolves in meaningful, permanent ways based on player progression on N64 hardware?"},{"context":"The stream showed the live chat suggesting the volcano eruption, which you then integrated into the game's design.","question":"How do you view the role of your live stream audience in this project? Can you describe your process for filtering their real-time feedback and deciding which ideas, like the volcano, are worth pursuing?"},{"context":"You've expressed frustration with bugs in your primary tool, Fast64, which impacts things like lighting and opacity, forcing you to find workarounds.","question":"How do these technical limitations and tool-related bugs influence your creative decisions? Have you ever found that being forced to work around a problem has led to an unexpected or even better design choice?"},{"context":"You mentioned a disinterest in pop culture and philosophy, stating 'I think it is all stupid,' suggesting you create from a more personal space.","question":"How does this mindset of tuning out external trends influence your creative process? Does it give you more freedom to build worlds and characters based purely on your own first principles and what you find compelling?"}],"biobak":[{"context":"The stream established a clear workflow where Kaze implements initial ideas and you then 'polish it up and make it look better,' including remaking assets like the Goombas.","question":"Could you walk me through your process? What does it look like to receive a new area or asset from Kaze, and how do you approach the task of 'polishing' his foundational work into the final visual style of the game?"},{"context":"Kaze is developing custom shaders and complex visual effects, pushing the limits of the N64 hardware. Your role is to refine this work.","question":"When Kaze creates something technically complex, like a new custom shader, how does that affect your work as the graphics artist? How do you balance artistic refinement with the technical limitations and quirks of the original hardware?"}],"badub":[],"zeina":[]}
