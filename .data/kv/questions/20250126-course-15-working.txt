{"kaze":[{"context":"In the stream, you passionately stated your desire for ROM hacks like 'Return to Yoshi's Island' (RTYI) to be respected as 'real games,' playable without the context of Mario 64, and that you 'definitely want to change that' perception.","question":"Kaze, could you elaborate on what achieving that 'standalone game' quality means to you for RTYI? How are you specifically designing it to transcend the typical ROM hack perception and meet your vision of a 'legitimate game'?"},{"context":"You described a fascinating part of your development process for the 'Cosmic Colony' level: 'Really what we're doing now is we already made the platforming, and now we're just trying to justify the platforms we've made.'","question":"Can you walk us through an example from RTYI where a core platforming sequence was established first, and then share how you layered in the aesthetic, thematic, or even narrative elements to 'justify' its existence and integrate it into the world?"},{"context":"You mentioned, 'We haven't really planned the story yet. I think it's better to just put together some gameplay first, and then plan the story around the gameplay you have. Because it's a Mario game.'","question":"How does this gameplay-first approach influence the eventual narrative possibilities for RTYI? What freedoms or challenges does it present when you later begin to weave a story around pre-existing levels and mechanics?"},{"context":"During development of the 'Cosmic Colony,' you noted performance on N64 hardware, like FPS drops with many plants ('43 FPS. Ooh, it doesn't like all these plants here'), and you also talk about levels needing a certain 'sauce' to feel right.","question":"How do you balance your ambitious visual and gameplay goals for RTYI with the inherent limitations of N64 hardware? Could you discuss how this technical push-and-pull influences your iterative process of finding that 'sauce' that makes a level truly engaging?"},{"context":"You've stated, 'I'm planning to open source this game anyway, so there's little point in leaking it,' which is a significant decision for RTYI.","question":"What are your primary motivations behind the decision to open source 'Return to Yoshi's Island'? What impact do you hope this will have on the SM64 modding community, and perhaps on broader game development learning, once its code is publicly accessible?"},{"context":"The stream highlighted your focus on visual clarity and player guidance, such as implementing 'glowing outlines on all the platforms' and using signs to direct players.","question":"Could you discuss the evolution of your approach to ensuring players can easily navigate and understand the environments in RTYI? Perhaps share a specific instance where you identified a clarity issue and the design solutions you implemented to address it."},{"context":"You shared a core belief during the stream: 'For me, gaming is all about freedom.'","question":"How does this personal philosophy that 'gaming is all about freedom' directly shape your design decisions in 'Return to Yoshi's Island'? In what specific ways do you aim to provide players with a sense of agency and freedom, and how does that tie into your overarching vision for the game?"}],"biobak":[],"badub":[],"zeina":[]}
