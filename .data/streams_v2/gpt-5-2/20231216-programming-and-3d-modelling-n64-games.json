He refines the mission concepts (three outlaw boss encounters that end with jailing the culprits), explores references and AI concept art to find a “goofy cowboy town” palette, and discovers that adding a skybox/fog dramatically improves the look. He also discusses technical tradeoffs: fog forces expensive 2‑cycle materials (as seen previously in Oily Boily Bay), and he outlines a layout choice (a town wrapped around a central mountain) to improve N64 culling/performance.
