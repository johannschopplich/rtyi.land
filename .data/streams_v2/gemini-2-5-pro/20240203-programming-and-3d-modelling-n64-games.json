He rejected an obvious hole and a fake cutout, settling on a breakable rock that requires a power-up. This design choice forces players to connect story clues to solve the puzzle, rather than finding it by chance.",
      "challenge": "A secret area in the Wild West level needed an entrance that players would discover by following story clues from a bank robbery, not by stumbling upon it accidentally.",
      "process": "Kaze first considered a simple, visible hole but rejected it as poor design. He then brainstormed a Wile E. Coyote-style fake cardboard boulder but concluded it was too obvious and would encourage accidental discovery. After weighing the options, he decided a breakable rock requiring a specific power-up was the best way to ensure player intentionality.",
