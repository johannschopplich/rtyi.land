He confirmed this by testing on both an emulator with save states and on real hardware, where outcomes differed on each boot.",

He experimented with adding visual blockers like dunes, then tried a long dock to frame a view of a distant lighthouse. After identifying the dock's potential for player frustration, he pivoted to using a cinematic cutscene to achieve the same goal. He also decided to use a character, Pachyderm, to block the first course until the player collects a few coins, teaching a core mechanic.",
