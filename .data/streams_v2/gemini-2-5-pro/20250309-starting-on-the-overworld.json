      "process": "Kaze started with a basic blockout that felt too large and direct. Through live iteration and chat feedback, he explored ideas like a long dock for a better camera angle, which was rejected for being frustrating. He then pivoted to using landscape features to obstruct and guide the player's view, creating a more compelling path of discovery.",
      "outcome": "The agreed-upon design uses visual obstruction (dunes) to guide the player, a locked second course entrance to build curiosity, and a gated first course that requires exploration and learning a mechanic (collecting coins or ground-pounding an NPC) to access. An intro cutscene will establish the setting and tease distant landmarks like the lighthouse.",

      "process": "Kaze implemented a new random function to be faster than the vanilla one. In doing so, it inadvertently began using the N64's clock cycle counter as a seed, which is affected by minute, real-world physical variations. He demonstrated this by loading a savestate multiple times on both an emulator and real hardware, getting a different random outcome each time.",
      "outcome": "Kaze has accepted that traditional TASing will be impossible. He plans to mitigate the impact by making RNG less critical to gameplay (e.g., coins that chase Mario) but acknowledges that boss fights will be difficult to test.

      "process": "Kaze felt that direct, immediate access to the first course was 'lame.' He brainstormed several gating mechanisms, including a coin toll or an environmental switch. The idea of using the Pachyderm from Yoshi's Story was raised, which led to the final dual-solution design that teaches multiple game systems.",
      "outcome": "The plan is to block the entrance with a Pachyderm NPC. The player can either pay a toll using coins found around the overworld (teaching the global coin mechanic) or figure out that a ground pound will topple the NPC (teaching a gameplay secret).",
