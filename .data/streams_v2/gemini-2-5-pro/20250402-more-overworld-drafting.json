The idea evolved from a simple barrier to a Kamek-centric event where the blocks are enchanted, providing a clear cause (Kamek's magic) and effect (beating Kamek makes them friendly).",
      "outcome": "The team decided on a new overworld event where Kamek enchants large 'Yap Blocks', turning them into rude, rhyming obstacles.
