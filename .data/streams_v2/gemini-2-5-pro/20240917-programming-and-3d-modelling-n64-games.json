      "process": "Kaze spent over two hours experimenting with various failed methods, including simple textures, AI generation, manual drawing, and complex Blender displacement maps suggested by his community. The breakthrough came from recalling a technique used by another developer (Daryl) and adapting it to his needs, which involves using the CPU to calculate lighting for a normal map and baking the result into the texture palette in real-time.",
