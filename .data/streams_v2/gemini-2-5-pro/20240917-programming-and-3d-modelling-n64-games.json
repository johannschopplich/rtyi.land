      "process": "Kaze first tried simple textures, then a two-texture 'fake bump map', both of which failed. He then struggled to implement a community suggestion using Blender's displacement mapping, as he was unfamiliar with the tool. After dismissing an attempt with AI, he adapted a technique from another developer ('Daryl') to perform the lighting calculations on the CPU before rendering.",
      "outcome": "After hours of failed attempts, Kaze devised a concrete plan: limit styrofoam objects to a few fixed rotations and use a pre-rotated normal map for each. Every frame, the CPU will calculate the lighting for each of the normal map's 16 palette entries and update them, faking a dynamic lighting effect that the N64 can render.",
      "key_quote": "The N64 also can't do normal maps. We have to compute the output of the normal map before we pass this to the renderer on the CPU, which fortunately is cheap, which is why we used 16 directions.",
