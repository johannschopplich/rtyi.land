He then attempted to generate his own textures using Blender's displacement maps with guidance from the community, but struggled with the unfamiliar tool. After dismissing AI generation and manual drawing, he settled on a programmatic solution inspired by another developer, using a normal map provided by a community member.",
      "outcome": "Kaze devised a complex but viable plan to programmatically fake the lighting effect. This involves pre-generating normal maps for limited rotations and using the CPU to calculate lighting frame-by-frame into the texture's palette. While the code is not yet written, he is confident the approach will work, despite its design limitations.",
