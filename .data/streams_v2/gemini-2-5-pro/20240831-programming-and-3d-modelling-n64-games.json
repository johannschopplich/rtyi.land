      "challenge": "Kaze's game was severely limited by the N64's RSP (CPU), and existing microcodes like F3DX2 were not optimized for this bottleneck. Soren's initial F3DX3 versions were even slower.",

      "process": "Soren and Kaze toggled the 'auto-batching' feature in F3DX3 and isolated a 3ms performance cost. Kaze then inspected the rabbit's model data and confirmed it was structured to reload the same material 14 times per rabbit, instead of batching the draw calls efficiently.",
      "outcome": "The incident highlighted the power of the new microcode to paper over asset creation problems. Kaze now understands the inefficiency and can either rely on F3DX3's automatic fix or remodel the rabbits, leading to a deeper understanding of the interplay between engine tech and asset pipelines.",
