However, Sauraen's F3DX3 microcode automatically batched the redundant material loads, providing a massive 3-millisecond performance improvement without any changes to the asset itself. This incident became a key proof-of-concept for the power of F3DX3.",

      "process": "While testing F3DX3, Sauraen and Kaze investigated the performance of a scene with many rabbits. They discovered that F3DX3's auto-batching feature was providing a massive performance boost. This led to an examination of the rabbit's geometry file, which confirmed it was reloading materials inefficiently for each limb. The team briefly discussed alternative optimization methods before concluding F3DX3's solution was sufficient for now.",
      "outcome": "The auto-batching feature in F3DX3 was so effective that it automatically mitigated the poorly optimized model, saving 3ms of texture loading time. While Kaze still plans to fix the model, the microcode provided a powerful, automatic solution, demonstrating its value.",
