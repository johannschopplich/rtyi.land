He rejected a computationally expensive method in favor of directly manipulating the texture's UV coordinates, demonstrating deep N64 optimization knowledge while debugging visual artifacts to achieve a polished final effect.",
      "challenge": "A dynamic sun flare was requested that would rotate convincingly as the player moves the camera, creating a modern lighting effect on retro hardware.",
      "process": "Kaze received the request and considered different technical approaches. He dismissed a suggestion to rotate the entire texture plane as too performance-intensive. Instead, he wrote custom code to directly manipulate the texture's UV coordinates based on camera yaw and pitch. He then debugged visual artifacts caused by texture repeating, eventually fixing them by adjusting texture clamping and mirroring settings.",

      "challenge": "An updated, high-detail Goomba King model from Biobak needed to be imported, but its custom animations and billboarded crown broke inside the game engine.",
      "process": "Upon importing the new Goomba model, Kaze saw that its animations were causing it to clip through the ground and its crown was not billboarded correctly. He identified that the billboard was inheriting rotation incorrectly due to limitations in his own engine code, which assumes all billboarded objects are spherical. He attempted some fixes but concluded it would require more work off-stream.",
