      "process": "Kaze first tried a standard near background (NBG), but it failed because level geometry touched it, creating a 'painted on' look. He then tried warping the 3D model of the water, which also looked wrong. Following feedback from his team, he implemented the final solution: a large 3D plane for the ocean that moves at 85-95% of the camera's speed, creating a convincing illusion of distance.",
      "outcome": "After extensive trial and error, Kaze developed a successful technique using a separate 3D plane that moves with the camera to create a parallax effect. This gave the illusion of an infinite ocean, solving the visual and technical problem to his satisfaction.",
