He then tried a non-fogged background plane (NFBG), but found it looked unconvincing when level elements touched the horizon. This led to the final, novel idea of a camera-relative 3D plane that fakes perspective and parallax.",
      "outcome": "A hybrid solution was developed where a 3D model of the water is curved up at the edges and dynamically moves with the camera. This, combined with color gradients suggested by Biobak, creates a convincing illusion of an infinite ocean within the console's hardware limits.",
