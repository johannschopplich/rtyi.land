He then tried manipulating the 3D ocean model itself. Following a visual mockup from Biobak, he experimented extensively with color gradients and eventually invented a new technique combining a 3D model with a parallax background plane, requiring meticulous tweaking of its movement speed relative to the camera.",
      "outcome": "After numerous failed attempts, Kaze developed a hybrid solution. He combined a 3D model of the ocean (with its edges curved up to create an optical illusion) with a separate background plane that moves with the camera at a slightly different rate (a parallax effect), finally achieving the desired look of a vast, integrated ocean.",
