He then further optimized it by having the function only load the Y-coordinate data (the first 16 bytes) of the remaining surfaces into the cache, significantly reducing data processing.",

      "process": "Kaze systematically debugged the issue by removing code blocks to isolate the problem. He discovered the error was in the complex interaction between Mario's state, the held object's properties, and the order in which rotation and position data were being applied. He had to refactor the code to ensure the angles were copied correctly before the object's position was offset.",

He realized the function he used to spawn the signs was intended for dynamic objects and didn't correctly initialize the interpolated position, causing a feedback loop. He moved the sign spawning to a different function to resolve it.",
