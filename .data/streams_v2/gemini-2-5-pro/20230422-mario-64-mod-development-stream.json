He hypothesized it could be an issue with reading object fields, compiler optimizations, or the fundamental way his held object code interacts with vanilla functions. After a long process of trial and error, he pinpointed the faulty code segment and rewrote it to correctly copy Mario's angle to the held object.",

      "challenge": "The original SM64 engine has a 'floor cocking' bug where certain floor geometries can cause Mario to fall through the world. Fixing this naively would remove a performance optimization.",
      "process": "Kaze explained that the original game sorted surfaces from highest to lowest and stopped checking after finding the first valid floor, which caused the bug. The simple fix was to remove this sorting, but that hurt performance. Kaze's breakthrough was to keep the sorting but add a preliminary check to discard floors that are too far above Mario, and then only load the Y-coordinate data (the first 0x10 bytes of the surface struct) for the remaining floors, saving a significant amount of processing time.",
