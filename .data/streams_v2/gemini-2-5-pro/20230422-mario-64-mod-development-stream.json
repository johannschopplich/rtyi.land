      "summary": "Kaze identified a performance bottleneck related to a long-standing bug in the SM64 engine's collision detection. He devised a clever optimization that not only fixed the bug but also significantly improved performance by minimizing the amount of data loaded for collision checks.",
      "challenge": "In vanilla SM64, a bug called 'floor clocking' can cause Mario to fall through the world because one surface can computationally hide another. The obvious fix of removing surface sorting was inefficient.",
      "process": "Kaze devised a new approach. Instead of removing the surface sorting, he kept it but added a step to discard any floors that are too far above Mario. For the remaining potential floors, the code now only loads the essential Y-coordinate data, not the entire surface struct, significantly reducing the amount of data processed per frame.",
      "outcome": "The new method fixes the bug while being a major performance optimization. It avoids loading unnecessary surface data into the dcache, making collision detection faster and more reliable.",
      "key_quote": "So since we need to fix floor clacking like this, we originally had to remove the sorting priority as well. But I had the idea, what if we just keep the sorting priority, and we kill all the floors that are too high, and then we can just only iterate 0x10 bytes of each floor?",

He diagnosed it as a subtle frame rate-dependent issue caused by misusing a recently-refactored core engine function, and was able to fix it by removing the erroneous function call.",
      "challenge": "After implementing new tutorial bunny models from Biobak, Kaze discovered they were erratically bouncing up and down, an issue that only appeared at 60 FPS.",
      "process": "Kaze diagnosed the issue by observing its correlation with the frame rate. He theorized it was caused by a core function he'd modified that sets an object's interpolated position. He realized this function, intended for dynamic objects, was being incorrectly called on the static signs, causing them to offset their own position every frame.",
      "outcome": "By identifying and removing the incorrect function call on the static bunny object, Kaze fixed the bouncing. The new tutorial signs now appear correctly in the game, ready for animation.",
      "key_quote": "I have a theory. It's because of this function. It's because I changed how this works... That happened because the sign offsets itself every frame after this function has been called.",

      "challenge": "A major code refactor caused a critical bug where objects held by Mario, like a Resnor, would have completely incorrect rotation and translation, making them unplayable.",
      "process": "Kaze began a methodical process of elimination, commenting out blocks of code in the 'held object' logic until the bug disappeared, thereby isolating the fault. He discovered the issue was a complex interaction between how the object's angle was being copied from Mario's state and how its position was being offset, requiring multiple adjustments to fix.",
