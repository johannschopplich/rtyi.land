After analyzing Mario Galaxy and brainstorming various solutions, Kaze landed on a hybrid design featuring a pinball-like sub-level that connects multiple paths, solving the problem of making a guided experience feel open.",

      "process": "Kaze started by defining the goals: 'fun' and 'freedom'. He analyzed Super Mario Galaxy's 'Beehive Galaxy' to understand how it mixed linear and open sections. He brainstormed and rejected a simple hub world with portals as 'lame'. The turning point was a chat suggestion that led to the idea of placing the red coin flipper area underneath the main stage, physically connecting all the paths.",
      "outcome": "Kaze developed a hybrid design concept. The level will have multiple linear paths leading to distinct challenges (like arcade games), but they will be connected by a more open central area. A major breakthrough was adding a sub-level with pinball flippers that can shoot the player back up to the main paths, creating interconnectedness and movement freedom.",

      "challenge": "To create arcade game-themed stars that are fun to play as 3D platforming challenges, rather than being simple UI-based games or concepts that don't fit Mario's moveset.",

He looked through Mario Party minigames for inspiration, which led to the concept of adapting classic arcade games into physical spaces for Mario to navigate.",
