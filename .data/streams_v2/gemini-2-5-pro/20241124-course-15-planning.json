He decided to place a large flipper-based platforming area directly underneath the main stage, allowing players to drop down and be shot back up, creating a highly interconnected and vertically complex environment.",
      "challenge": "The 'Space Arcade' level needed to provide clear goals to the player without feeling like a series of disconnected, linear paths, which Kaze found uninteresting.",
      "process": "Kaze wrestled with the linear-versus-open design problem. He considered and discarded ideas like just having signs or separate warps. The breakthrough came from thinking about verticality and how to physically connect different paths in a novel way, leading to the idea of the sub-stage flipper area.",
      "outcome": "Kaze devised a multi-layered level structure. The main paths are above, but players can drop down to a large pinball/flipper area below. This area not only houses its own collectibles (Red Coins) but also serves as a dynamic transportation system, shooting the player back up to different points on the main path, thus connecting the entire level.",
