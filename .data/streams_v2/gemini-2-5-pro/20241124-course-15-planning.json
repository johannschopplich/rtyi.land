After analyzing other games and brainstorming, he had a breakthrough idea to create a vertical level structure with a sub-level that shoots the player back up, solving the linearity problem by adding a new dimension of movement and connection.",

      "process": "Kaze brainstormed several solutions, including changing the level layout per star (like Mario Galaxy) and creating open-ended zones between linear challenges. The breakthrough came when he considered how to integrate the red coin collection, leading to the idea of a separate, connected vertical layer.",
      "outcome": "Kaze landed on a multi-layered design. The main paths are above, while a dangerous 'flipper' area for collecting red coins sits below. This allows players to drop down and get shot back up, creating verticality, connecting disparate parts of the level, and fostering a sense of freedom.",
