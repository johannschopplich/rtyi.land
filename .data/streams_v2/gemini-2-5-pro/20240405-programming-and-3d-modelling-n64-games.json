The solution revealed a fundamental conflict between modern optimization techniques and the assumptions of the original 25-year-old code, but ultimately resulted in a working enemy with new visual enhancements.",

      "process": "Kaze undertook a lengthy debugging process, using console logs and stubbing out code. He discovered the root cause was an optimization in his engine that prevented non-moving objects from doing floor checks. Since Pokey segments are moved by a parent object rather than their own velocity, they weren't finding the ground. After disabling this optimization for the Pokey, he fixed further bugs related to scaling and model orientation to restore full functionality.",
