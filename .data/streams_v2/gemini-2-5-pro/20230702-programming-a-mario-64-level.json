      "process": "Kaze began by debugging the assembly code at the crash address. He noticed a function was being inlined, which complicated debugging. After preventing the inlining, he traced the problem to an invalid behavior script pointer, indicating memory corruption. He correctly deduced that a recent change to object field definitions meant a value was being written to the wrong memory location, overwriting the pointer.",
