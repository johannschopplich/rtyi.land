After getting inspiration from other games, he decided to model and place distant cliffs. He then faced a technical hurdle where the fog color on the cliffs didn't match the level's fog. He diagnosed this as a saturation mismatch in the shaders and adjusted the level's base fog color to create a seamless blend.",
