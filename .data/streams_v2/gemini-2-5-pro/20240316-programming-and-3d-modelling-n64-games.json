      "process": "Kaze first attempted to use quicksand at the bottom, but disliked the visual result. He then experimented with fading the level edges into the blue skybox color. Drawing inspiration from Kalimari Desert and F-Zero, he decided to create distant cliffs on a separate background layer to achieve a parallax effect. This led to a new problem of matching the cliff color to the level's fog, which he solved by debugging the color combiner settings and adjusting the global fog color itself.",
