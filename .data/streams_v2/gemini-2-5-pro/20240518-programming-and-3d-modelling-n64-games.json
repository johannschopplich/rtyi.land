      "challenge": "To create a visually convincing and functional ice platform for Course 13 that cracks on a player's first jump and shatters on the second, which required a complex visual effect beyond a simple model swap.",
      "process": "Kaze began by brainstorming ideas and reviewing a concept file from Biobak. He then spent hours implementing a complex shader using primitive colors and alpha channels to create a dissolving effect. This involved multiple rounds of debugging, fixing crashes, and tweaking values. He later added custom-colored triangle and mist particles to enhance the shattering animation, constantly iterating to get the timing and look right.",
      "outcome": "A working, multi-stage platform was created. It uses a custom shader to show growing cracks, then dissolves while spawning particle effects. Kaze finished the stream feeling the effect was acceptable but not perfect, acknowledging he might be too close to the work to judge it objectively.",
