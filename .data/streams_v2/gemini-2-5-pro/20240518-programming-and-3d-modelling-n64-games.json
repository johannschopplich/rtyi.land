He incorporated a shader concept from Biobak, which led to a deep dive into N64 material properties, using primitive colors, alpha channels, and dithering to simulate the effect. He then added and refined particle effects for the shattering, tweaking their color, velocity, and spawn patterns to hide visual imperfections.",
