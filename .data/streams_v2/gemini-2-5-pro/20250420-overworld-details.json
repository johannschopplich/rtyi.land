He brainstormed several technical approaches, dismissing Gerstner waves as too complex. He then implemented a solution using a hex-tessellated mesh, wrote code to manipulate vertices, debugged crashes and visual bugs, and iteratively tweaked parameters for speed and height until the effect looked right.",
