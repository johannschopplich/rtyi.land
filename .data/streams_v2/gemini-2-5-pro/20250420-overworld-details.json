      "process": "Kaze began by analyzing and rejecting water effects from other games. He considered and abandoned a complex Gerstner wave simulation due to performance costs. He then settled on a sine wave approach, iteratively building a custom mesh, writing code to manipulate its vertices, debugging crashes and visual glitches, and refining the effect with variable amplitude and dynamic coloring to simulate depth and movement toward the island.",
      "outcome": "Kaze successfully implemented a custom water effect using a hex-tessellated mesh manipulated by a sine wave. The final effect features waves that calm as they approach shore, dynamic vertex coloring for depth, and a slight curvature to the mesh, achieving the desired tropical look.",
