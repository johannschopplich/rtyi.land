He implemented a basic sine wave system, debugged a crash caused by excessive collision triangles, and then iteratively improved the effect by adding dynamic vertex coloring for depth, adjusting wave parameters, making waves smaller near the shore, and adding a curve to the mesh to perfect the illusion of inward-flowing waves.",
