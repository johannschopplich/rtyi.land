      "process": "During the stream, Kaze discussed his upcoming YouTube video plans. Biobak, watching the stream, suggested alternative, more sensational titles. Kaze immediately recognized their effectiveness and praised Biobak's ingenuity, estimating the title change alone would quadruple the video's views.",

      "challenge": "The existing Goomba boss fight was considered underwhelming and in need of a redesign to make it more engaging.",
      "process": "Following suggestions from Biobak, Kaze began implementing a new boss fight concept. He coded the Goomba King's new movement patterns, the behavior of the smaller Goombas that push the main boulder, and the logic for aiming and firing the boulder. Throughout the process, he fixed numerous bugs related to physics, animation, and object states.",
      "outcome": "The core mechanics of the new boss fight were largely implemented during the stream. The fight is now a more interactive puzzle where the player must manipulate the boss's position and use the environment against him. Only minor animations and the boss doors are left to be finished.",
      "key_quote": "Let's recap on how we want the fight to work. What was the idea? You want the Goomba to pick a place. He just walks there. And then the boulder follows Mario. Not the other way around. So you have to aim the boulder at him.",
