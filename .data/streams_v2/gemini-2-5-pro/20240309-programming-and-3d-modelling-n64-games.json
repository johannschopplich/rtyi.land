To solve it, he identified a large background object with thousands of collision triangles and created a much simpler, non-rendered mesh to serve as its collision, reducing memory usage.",

He wrote code to trigger when Mario talks to the pianist, which then iterates through other NPCs in the area and changes their head rotation to look at Mario.
