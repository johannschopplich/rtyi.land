The story shows the practical push-and-pull between Kaze's technical experimentation and the artistic needs of the team, ending with Kaze deferring to his collaborator's expertise.",

He prototyped several visual ideas in Blender, experimenting with N64-specific rendering tricks like environment maps and vertex color. He received real-time feedback and technical suggestions from the community and, crucially, from Biobak, who vetoed one direction as being too difficult to model.",
      "outcome": "After numerous experiments with different aesthetics (spikes, hexagons, bricks) and techniques, no definitive style was chosen during the stream.
