A viewer suggested 'Sluggy the Unshaven' from Yoshi's Island, which Kaze immediately adopted for its thematic link. However, further community discussion led to a more complex squid monster concept, which Kaze then fleshed out with mechanics for attacks, visual cues, and how the player would damage it.",
