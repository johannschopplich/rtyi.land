A significant portion of the stream was dedicated to a collaborative brainstorming session with the chat to design the level's boss, which evolved from 'The Blob' to a complex giant squid encounter. Kaze also discussed the recent release of a new demo for Course 1 and debugged a critical bug preventing the game from booting on real hardware.",

      "process": "Kaze initially proposed 'The Blob' from 1950s sci-fi films. A community member suggested 'Sluggy the Unshaven' from Yoshi's Island, which Kaze briefly adopted. This evolved through further community feedback into a giant squid monster attacking from Fortnite-style rifts. The team then brainstormed various ways to damage it, rejecting ideas that involved waiting in favor of active engagement.",
      "outcome": "The team converged on a concept for a giant squid-like boss that attacks from rifts. The player will be cued by dynamic lighting from the rifts and will attack the boss's vulnerable eyes when it appears, creating an active, platforming-centric encounter rather than a passive waiting game.",
