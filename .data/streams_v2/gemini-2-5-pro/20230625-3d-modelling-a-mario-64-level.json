After discarding other methods, he chose to render footprints directly onto the cement's texture. He simplified the problem by using circular prints instead of complex rotating ones, successfully creating a dynamic and persistent effect on original hardware.",
      "challenge": "How to implement persistent footprints in a cement pit on the N64 without running into performance limits from spawning too many objects.",
      "process": "Kaze first considered and rejected spawning decals due to performance limits. He then decided to render directly to a texture. He ran into issues with rotating the footprint image, which would be too complex, so he simplified the design to use circular prints. The rest of the process involved a deep dive into C code to handle texture manipulation, coordinate mapping, and debugging visual glitches.",
      "outcome": "Kaze successfully implemented the feature by rendering circular footprints directly onto a large, static texture. This avoids performance issues and allows the entire area to be covered in footprints, though the initial idea of rotating realistic footprints was sacrificed for feasibility.",
