After hitting a wall, he made a design compromise to use circular prints, solving the technical issue by simplifying the art.",

      "process": "Kaze first considered spawning decals but realized it wouldn't scale. He then pivoted to a 'render to texture' approach, but hit a major roadblock trying to program a bitmap rotation algorithm that would work with the N64's texture format and memory constraints. After struggling, he opted to simplify the art to eliminate the technical problem.",
      "outcome": "Kaze solved the complex rotation problem by compromising on the art, changing the footprints to simple circles that look the same from any angle. This allowed the core mechanic to work, though the issue remains for other non-symmetrical effects like the butt-stomp.",
