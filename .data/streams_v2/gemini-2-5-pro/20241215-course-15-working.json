After his initial attempts with hardware color combiners failed, he devised a clever workaround using an indexed texture and custom C code to manage its color palette, successfully implementing the feature while maintaining performance.",

After declaring that approach 'not possible,' he pivoted to a different strategy: converting the logo texture to an indexed 4-bit (I4) format and writing custom code to dynamically update its 16-color palette.",
      "outcome": "The new solution worked perfectly, allowing the 'M' logo to be rendered with anti-aliasing in a single cycle. This approach also allows the cap's color to be dynamically changed for power-ups via C code that manipulates the texture's color palette.",
