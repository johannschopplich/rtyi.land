      "process": "Kaze used a debugging emulator and a process of elimination. He systematically removed different types of objects from the level file—lightning effects, moving crates, enemies, and coin formations—and recompiled the game after each change to see if the crash persisted. After many failed attempts, he correctly deduced the issue was with texture animations.",
      "outcome": "Kaze successfully identified that the 'Detect Channels' scripts, which handle texture animations, were causing the crash. They were referencing vertex data from the old level geometry, which no longer existed, leading to an error. With the cause identified, he could begin reprogramming them.",
