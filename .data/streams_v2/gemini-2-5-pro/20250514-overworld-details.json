      "process": "Kaze first tried creating a 2D background plane with 3D trees in front. He identified that the clashing art styles and colors were the main problem. He then cycled through various textures, struggled with GIMP's color indexing which created visual artifacts, and finally used a texture by Zeina processed in Photoshop to achieve a much cleaner look. The final result involved carefully placing rows of 3D trees in front of the backdrop.",
      "outcome": "After extensive experimentation with layering, textures, and different software, Kaze developed a multi-layered forest using a combination of a 2D backdrop and 3D tree models. While not perfect, it serves as a functional and visually acceptable base to build upon.",
