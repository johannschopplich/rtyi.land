He then dove into technical experimentation, manipulating the game's perspective matrix to create a 'trippy' visual filter. He combined this technical proof-of-concept with the other gameplay ideas to form a complete design.",

Feeling stuck, he had a sudden inspiration and pivoted to an entirely different mechanic involving a moving platform.",
