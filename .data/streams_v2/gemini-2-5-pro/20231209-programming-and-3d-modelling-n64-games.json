      "title": "Creating the 3D 'Board the Platforms' Background",
      "summary": "Kaze needed to create the background for the Smash 64-themed level. His initial idea proved flawed, so he pivoted to a more creative and technical solution involving modeling the background as giant spheres with cutouts, resulting in a visually dynamic and performant 3D version of the classic backdrop.",
      "challenge": "Replicating the iconic 'Board the Platforms' background from Smash 64 in 3D in a way that was visually impressive and performant on N64 hardware.",
      "process": "Kaze's first idea was to use many individual, semi-transparent square planes. He quickly realized this would have performance issues and didn't look right. After abandoning that, he conceived a new plan: creating a giant UV sphere, 'drawing' the shapes on it in Blender, and deleting the negative space. He implemented this for three different colored layers, debugged a rotation issue, and added a slow spin to each layer.",
      "outcome": "Kaze successfully created a multi-layered, rotating skybox by cutting shapes out of several large spheres. This new method was more performant and achieved the desired high-quality, 3D parallax effect he was aiming for.",

      "challenge": "A viewer provided feedback that the d-pad camera controls were not suitable for making small, precise adjustments because of the built-in acceleration.",
      "process": "Kaze first explained his rationale: the camera was designed to serve both as a slow, main camera for casual players and for quick adjustments. Acknowledging the user's point, he then went into the code, changed the base velocity and acceleration values, recompiled the game, and tested the new feel live on stream.",
      "outcome": "Kaze implemented a new acceleration curve for the camera controls on the spot. He felt the adjustment was a good compromise that still served both casual players and those needing precise control, deciding to keep the change for now.",
      "key_quote": "It can work as both. If you want to make precise adjustments, the smoothing messes up. And if you want to use it as a main camera button, it all starts frustrating. I am using it as both, and it works for me.",
