He created a custom material that combines multiple textures and uses vertex colors to add detailed, controllable graininess, overcoming the hardware's constraints.",
      "challenge": "A large, detailed sand texture appeared flat and lacked detail due to the N64's limited 4-bit (I4) texture format, which causes visible color banding.",
      "process": "Instead of using one texture, Kaze created a custom material 'combiner'. This uses one texture for color and a second for fine detail. By manipulating the combiner's math, he rescaled the color range of the detail texture, preserving its fidelity. He then used vertex colors on the 3D model to control the intensity of this detail effect.",
