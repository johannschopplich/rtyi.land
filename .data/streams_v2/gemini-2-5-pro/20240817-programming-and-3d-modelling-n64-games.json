After prototyping revealed gameplay issues, he refined the concept into an automatic elevator, creating a more memorable and intuitive experience.",
      "challenge": "The original entrance to a slide in Course 1 was a simple pipe inside a tree stump that players had trouble discovering, and it was thematically uninteresting.",
      "process": "Kaze brainstormed alternatives with his stream chat, considering a cannon and a vine before settling on a growing flower inspired by Yoshi's Island. He prototyped it in Blender and realized a manual climb would be too difficult and annoying. This led to the refined idea of an automatic, spinning elevator. He then devised a complex technical solution to make the stalk appear to grow infinitely into the sky.",
      "outcome": "Kaze developed a detailed plan for a new mechanic: a flower bud that grows into a giant, automatically spinning stalk, acting as an elevator. This solution is more visually interesting, thematically appropriate for Yoshi's Island, and incorporates clear, non-verbal cues for the player.",
      "key_quote": "The problem is, how do you make the player know that they have to pull on it? That's my issue with that. And yes, the bunny can say that. But ideally, this level should be beatable without ever talking to anyone.",
