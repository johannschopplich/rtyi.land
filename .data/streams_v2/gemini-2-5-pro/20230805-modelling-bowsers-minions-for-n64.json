After looking for real-world inspiration, he was pointed towards the Wiggler's appearance in Mario Tennis. This led to the decision to have him stand upright, which then necessitated adding arms. Kaze began modifying the model, dealing with high polygon counts from the original DS model and beginning to rig the new standing posture.",
