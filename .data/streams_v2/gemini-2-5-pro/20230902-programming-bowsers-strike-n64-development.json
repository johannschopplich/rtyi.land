This led to a deep dive into fixing vertex colors, world lighting, and crashes. He also had to implement logic to assign the correct color (red, cyan, etc.) to each switch instance.",

He demonstrated that deleting the high-level GeoLayout pointer worked, but deleting the lower-level Display List did not, which seemed logically impossible until he found the hidden animation state logic.",
