For the animation, Kaze vehemently rejected using the toolchain's 'jank' bone system and instead created several distinct in-between models. After implementing them and adding color variants, community member Lilaa pointed out a placement error, which Kaze immediately fixed.",

      "process": "Kaze suspected a bug in the renderer or a graphics plugin setting. He tested the effect on a different emulator (NEMU) to isolate the problem. While the bug persisted, he realized NEMU was accurately replicating hardware crashes. After failing to find the specific setting causing the issue, Kaze deleted the graphics combiner and recreated it, which solved the problem.",
      "outcome": "The visual glitch was fixed by rebuilding the graphics combiner from scratch. More importantly, the debugging process led Kaze to discover that the NEMU emulator could replicate low-level hardware crashes, providing a powerful new tool that will significantly accelerate future debugging.",
