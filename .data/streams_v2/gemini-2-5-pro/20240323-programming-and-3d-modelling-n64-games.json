He worked through the technical steps in Blender and his codebase, overcoming model exporting and parenting issues to finally render the gun correctly in-game.",

      "process": "Kaze first tried a basic text display. Dissatisfied, he looked at Mario Party and Kirby for inspiration. After concluding that a purely HUD-based animated solution was too complex and 'painful' to program, he pivoted to using his existing cutscene tools to create a more dramatic and visually interesting introduction to the minigame.",
