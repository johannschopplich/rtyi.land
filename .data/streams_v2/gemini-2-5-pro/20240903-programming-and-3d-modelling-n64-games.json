After implementing a new microcode (FBDX3) from contributor Sauraen, they not only achieved a near-60 FPS framerate but also made a key technical discovery that the performance bottleneck had shifted from the RDP to the RSP, changing their approach to optimization.",

After initial troubleshooting where it seemed slower, he realized that by optimizing memory traffic so heavily, the bottleneck had shifted to the RSP, which the new microcode helps alleviate.",
      "outcome": "The game now runs at nearly 60 FPS in previously demanding areas. This led to a new technical understanding: for highly optimized N64 games, the RSP becomes the primary bottleneck, not memory or fillrate as is commonly believed.",
