After exploring and nearly choosing Dr. Mario, he was persuaded by his community to revisit Mario Paint, ultimately creating a detailed concept for a unique drawing minigame instead of a traditional platforming level.",
      "challenge": "A retro-themed section for Course 14 needed to be designed, but Kaze struggled to find a pre-Mario 64 game that could be adapted into a compelling 3D platforming experience without being boring or a repeat of a previous idea.",
      "process": "Kaze first considered and rejected Mario Paint as uninteresting. He then explored other options like Dr. Mario, nearly settling on it. After chat encouraged him to reconsider Mario Paint, he brainstormed a completely new drawing-based mechanic, moving away from platforming to create a unique minigame that still fits the retro theme.",
      "outcome": "Kaze, with input from his chat, devised a detailed and unique minigame concept for a Mario Paint level. The plan involves players tracing a dotted outline of Mario's face on a canvas, using different colors, with a system to score the final artwork.",
