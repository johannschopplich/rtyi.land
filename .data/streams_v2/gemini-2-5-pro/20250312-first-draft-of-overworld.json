The idea of an escaped penguin needing help emerged as the strongest, as it provided clear motivation and a fun chase mechanic.",
      "outcome": "The team decided that the player will find an escaped penguin in the overworld. By catching it (similar to Mips in SM64), the player gets a ticket or access to a secret entrance to help the penguin save its family, neatly tying the overworld puzzle to the level's internal story.",
