      "challenge": "A horizontal version of the wind turbine was needed for a platforming section, but rotating the existing vertical model in the game engine resulted in incorrect orientation due to gimbal lock.",
      "process": "Kaze first attempted to rotate the model in-game using its pitch, roll, and yaw properties. After realizing all three axes were producing the same, incorrect rotation, he expressed frustration and recalled solving a similar problem before. He concluded the only solution was to modify the asset itself outside the game engine.",
