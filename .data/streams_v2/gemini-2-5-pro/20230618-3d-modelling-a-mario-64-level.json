      "challenge": "A turbine model needed to be rotated horizontally for a platforming mechanic, but the game engine's controls for pitch, roll, and yaw were all rotating it on the wrong axes.",
      "process": "Kaze first attempted to use the in-engine rotation parameters (pitch, roll, and yaw). After discovering they were all affected by gimbal lock and wouldn't produce the desired horizontal rotation, he expressed frustration and recalled a similar issue from the past. He concluded the only solution was to modify the source model itself.",
