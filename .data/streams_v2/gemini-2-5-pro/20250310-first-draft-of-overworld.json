      "process": "Kaze brainstormed solutions, dismissing performantly-expensive ideas like multiple planes. He then began coding a solution live, struggling with the math and debugging inverted values. After feedback from Zeina and iterative testing, he realized the fog's intensity was non-linear and squared a value to create a smoother visual transition.",
      "outcome": "Kaze successfully implemented a hybrid solution using C code to manipulate the N64's hardware fog based on player distance and camera angle, combined with transparent 'fake fog' planes.
