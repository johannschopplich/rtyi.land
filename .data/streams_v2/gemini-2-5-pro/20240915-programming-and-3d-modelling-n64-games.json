      "challenge": "Kaze wanted to make the painted background of the craft level look shiny, as if it were wet paint, but lacked the hardware capabilities for modern shaders like normal maps on the N64.",
      "process": "Kaze devised the idea of a 'fake normal map' and wrote code for the N64's combiner to create the effect. He rejected more performance-heavy modern techniques like shell texturing. He then debugged and tweaked the parameters of his effect live on stream until it was visible and achieved the subtle, shiny look he envisioned.",
