Through experimentation and a breakthrough 'shiny paint' effect, he created a 3D paper cylinder background and a 'water' floor made of gift wrap.",

      "process": "Kaze started with Biobak's concept of a paper cylinder. He rejected using a desk as the setting. He experimented with various textures for the background and floor, including cobblestone and construction paper. A key moment was his idea to implement a 'fake normal map' to make the painted background look shiny, which he successfully coded as a cheap rim-lighting effect.",

      "process": "After creating the paper floor and cylindrical walls, Kaze immediately noticed the ugly intersection. He placed some individual mountain models, but they clipped through the floor. After considering the problem, he realized that instead of trying to blend the two surfaces, he could use a new foreground element (the mountain range) to completely obscure the problem area.",
