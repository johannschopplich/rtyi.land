He then modeled the object, debated the inclusion of a staple for authenticity, sourced and modified a texture for the roll, and coded a custom shader for the shiny top.",

      "challenge": "The initial layout for Course 14 felt too linear and simple, with paths that went straight forward without interesting choices.",
      "process": "Kaze used Blender's grease pencil tool to visually draw the intended player paths directly onto the 3D model. This allowed him to analyze the flow of the level, identify linear sections, and add new routes to create a more open-ended experience.",

      "challenge": "The level was experiencing performance issues when running on original N64 hardware, and Kaze needed to identify the specific cause to fix it.",
      "process": "Kaze loaded the level onto an N64 via his Summer Cart. By analyzing the debug output, he compared the processing times of the Reality Signal Processor (RSP, for geometry) and the Reality Display Processor (RDP, for pixel rendering). The high RDP time clearly indicated an overdraw problem.",
      "outcome": "Kaze determined the bottleneck was the RDP struggling with overdraw from many transparent or layered surfaces, not the RSP being overloaded with polygons. This gave him a clear optimization target: find and remove unnecessary overlapping geometry without sacrificing visual quality.",
