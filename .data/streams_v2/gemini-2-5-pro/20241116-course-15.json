      "process": "Kaze first hypothesized the crash was due to a collision map exceeding the engine's limits. He spent considerable time meticulously creating a simplified collision map, but the crash persisted. He then pivoted to a new theory, removing all actors from the level, which prevented the crash. This confirmed it was an object-related issue, leading him to begin a process of elimination to find the specific actor causing the overflow.",
