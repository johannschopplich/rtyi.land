He then added a particle effect for its death animation.",

      "process": "Instead of adding a check to Mario's code to see if he should be slipping, Kaze programmed the Fizz Oil enemy to detect when Mario is nearby and on a surface. The enemy's code then finds the specific floor triangle Mario is on, backs up its original properties, and temporarily changes it to a slippery type. It reliably changes it back once Mario is no longer affected.",
      "outcome": "A stable, non-invasive method for implementing the slippery surface effect was created. This reinforces Kaze's development philosophy and ensures the change is modular and less likely to cause cascading bugs in the core engine.",
