      "challenge": "The initial implementation of the paper spring used realistic physics, which made it feel too 'jelly' and unpredictable, making platforming difficult and frustrating for the player.",
      "process": "Kaze first implemented the spring with realistic physics. After testing, he identified the 'jelly' feel as a problem. He then adjusted the physics parameters, reducing the oscillation and making the spring settle quickly after Mario lands on it, creating a more stable and usable platforming element.",
