Kaze repeatedly misunderstood or disagreed with the explanation, believing it was either nonsensical or the same as existing, flawed methods. This led to a heated back-and-forth with analogies and expressions of frustration. Kaze eventually broke down Lilaa's steps line-by-line, which forced the clarification that the display list segment was being dynamically generated at runtime, the key piece of information he was missing.",
