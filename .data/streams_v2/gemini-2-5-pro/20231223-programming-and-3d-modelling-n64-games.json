      "process": "Live on stream, Kaze analyzed the video's YouTube Studio data. He noticed extremely high click-through and watch time metrics, which contradicted the low overall view count. He deduced that the algorithm was showing it to a new, non-typical audience that was very engaged, rather than his broader subscriber base.",
