To enable color variations without multiple models, he created a custom geo layout that used an object's behavior parameter (`bparam2`) to apply a color. This new code introduced a crash, which he debugged using NEMU64 and assembly. Finally, he fine-tuned the four pipe colors (shades of yellow, orange, and red, plus gray) for visual distinction.",
