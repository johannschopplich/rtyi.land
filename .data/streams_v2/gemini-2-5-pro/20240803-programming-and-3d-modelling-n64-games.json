He considered and rejected a 'hollow moon' concept due to technical constraints (it would require universal gravity changes). He debated using the regular vs. an ice-themed raven, ultimately settling on a design that leverages the iconic moon setting in a new, 3D-centric way.",
      "outcome": "A detailed, multi-phase boss fight concept was created. It involves Mario being launched to a moon, dodging stars in a free-fall sequence, fighting the raven on the moon's surface by using 'frozen cheese ninja stars', and a final phase back on the tower where the star hatches from an egg in a nest.",
