      "process": "Kaze led a brainstorming session, exploring ideas like a giant Mecha Bowser, a time machine suggested by Biobak, and a Giga Bowser fight. They wrestled with making the story feel consequential and building on the established theme of Bowser as a 'ruthless capitalist'. They combined the 'giant machine' idea (a drill) with the 'Super Happy Tree' lore to create a final level that leads into a thematically unique and humorous final boss encounter.",
      "outcome": "The team decided on a multi-stage finale. The final level is inside a giant drill built by Bowser. After the level, a cutscene shows Bowser absorbing the 'heart of the island', transforming into 'Yoshi Bowser'. The final fight occurs in the overworld, where the Super Happy Tree has become a 'Super Sad Tree', and the player must use its fruit to induce depression in Bowser to damage him. This concept provided a final level, a unique boss fight, and a narrative conclusion that fit the established themes.",
