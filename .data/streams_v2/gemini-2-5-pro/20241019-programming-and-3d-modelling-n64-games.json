This involved a meticulous, iterative process of tweaking variables until the chaotic system produced a reliable and visually interesting result.",

He added and removed various 'fudge factors' to introduce instability, observed the results in-game, and then returned to the code, slowly converging on the desired behavior.",
      "outcome": "After extensive tweaking, Kaze successfully created a flight path that swooped up, stalled, dove down, and pulled up again. He then fine-tuned the initial velocity and timing to make it land precisely on a pyramid, completing the gameplay mechanic.",
