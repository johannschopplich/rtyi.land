What you're describing is one way to kind of make anti-aliasing work in Photoshop, but it's nothing to do with what I did here. You're thinking of mipmap levels.

      "challenge": "To create a dynamic and physically authentic flight path for a paper airplane that would carry Mario to a specific landing spot on a pyramid, without resorting to a simple, pre-scripted animation.",
      "process": "Kaze spent the majority of the stream in a loop of adjusting code variables (velocity, pitch, gravity, friction, and other 'fudge factors'), compiling, and observing the result. The plane's behavior swung wildly from doing backflips to being too stable to flying straight into the ground. He methodically isolated variables and expressed frustration with both the complexity and the chat's suggestions before finally honing in on a working set of values.",
