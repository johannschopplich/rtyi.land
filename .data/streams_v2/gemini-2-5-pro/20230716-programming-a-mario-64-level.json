      "challenge": "The game was crashing on N64 hardware with a division-by-zero error, but not on the Project 64 emulator. The crash occurred in code Kaze had specifically written to prevent that exact error.",
      "process": "After the initial fix failed, Kaze inspected the compiled MIPS assembly code. He discovered the compiler was aggressively optimizing by executing the division instruction in the 'branch delay slot' of his safety check, nullifying the check entirely. He had to rewrite the C code to work around this compiler behavior.",
      "outcome": "Kaze successfully fixed the crash by restructuring his C code to prevent the compiler from making the problematic optimization. The incident serves as a stark example of the low-level challenges of console development.",
      "key_quote": "Basically, the compiler decided that right here, where I want to avoid the division by 0, it is going to pipeline the division into the delay slot of my branch. So that no matter what happens, I always divide by 0. That's not a bug in the code. That is not my fault.",
