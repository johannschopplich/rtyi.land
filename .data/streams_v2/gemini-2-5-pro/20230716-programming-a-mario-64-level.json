      "process": "Kaze tested the level on an N64 to identify the worst-performing camera angles. He then experimented with backface culling on the metal scaffolding textures, which were causing significant overdraw. After confirming a massive performance boost, he implemented a system to enable this optimization only when the game is running on N64 hardware.",

      "challenge": "The game was consistently crashing on N64 with a division-by-zero error, but the bug was undetectable on the less-accurate Project64 emulator. Kaze's code already contained a safety check to prevent this exact error.",
      "process": "After the crash, Kaze examined the compiled assembly code. He discovered that the GCC compiler was using a technique called 'branch delay slot pipelining,' which executed the division operation *before* the safety check was resolved. Recognizing this was a compiler issue and not a logic error, he manually reorganized his C code to force the compiler to generate safer assembly.",
      "outcome": "By reordering the assembly instructions, Kaze was able to work around the compiler's aggressive optimization, preventing the crash on N64 hardware. The fix was then ported to his other active project, 'Only Up 64,' which shared the same codebase.",
