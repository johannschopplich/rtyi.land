The stream is spent (1) testing new HUD fonts, animations and performance on real hardware, (2) debating texture/art fixes, and (3) redesigning a star mission—scrapping a rigid paper-airplane silver-star idea in favour of a Wing-Cap, free-flight challenge that uses new ‘bubble-blower’ paper targets.  Live on-stream Kaze models a graph-paper airplane and plans asset tasks with the art team.",
