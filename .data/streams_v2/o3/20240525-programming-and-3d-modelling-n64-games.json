    "summary": "Kaze spends the stream grey-boxing and brainstorming a large, icy castle level (likely Course 13) for “Return to Yoshi’s Island.”  He refines textures, shows new platforming tech (bridges, vanishing doors, appearing paths), and tries to solve the design problem of Star 1: a frozen star the player sees on entry but can’t reach until later.  After rejecting mirrors, cannons, and chandeliers, he settles on rolling a giant snowball into an ice wall to free the star.  He sketches the six-star route, discusses technical limits, and fixes minor model issues.",
