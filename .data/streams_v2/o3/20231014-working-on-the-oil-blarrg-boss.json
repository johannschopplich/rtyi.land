The main focus was a mine-cart themed screen for the Crystal Cave area; he fine-tuned fog, scrolling textures, spline movement and ensured the whole set-piece stayed inside the N64’s ±32 768 world-space limit to avoid crashes. He also reviewed new backgrounds from Biobak (Koopa Wave Cove/Carnival, Mouse Cave, Bubble Dome), talked about ROM-size optimisation for streamed music, and mentioned personal updates (moving house, new 3-D modelling job).",
