## Game Development Process
- Currently working on "Course 11" of "Return to Yoshi's Island 64," with a newly decided "oil rig" theme, replacing a previous "volcano" concept.
- The game is planned to have approximately 15 courses.
- Kaze is in the process of designing the layout and specific missions for Course 11, including a multi-stage narrative involving Bowser's minions, a strike, crane operation, and destroying a Bowser statue.
- Earlier levels, like "Course 1," are being revisited and tweaked for better design and verticality.
- The general workflow involves creating assets, experimenting with their combination, building out the level, and then refining. Course 11 is currently in the "shaping up" phase.
- End cutscene animations by Zeina are a dependency, and their completion is noted ("They took a while," implying they might be done or close).
- The next planned level after Course 11 is a "Wild West course."

## Personal Insights
- Kaze prefers to focus intently when playing games, which is why he usually doesn't play them on stream.
- He believes game design is fundamentally about solving problems, not just generating random ideas: "Designing something is not just about coming up with ideas it's about solving whatever problem you have in design."
- Kaze expresses a desire for games to offer genuine freedom and laments experiences where gameplay feels like following a pre-determined script: "That's not the freedom I want games to give me, you know."
- He acknowledges the difficulty of early-stage level design: "This level feels like it's starting really rough yeah yeah that's always how it goes."
- He finds inspiration can come unexpectedly: "Sometimes you just wake up and there's like random thoughts in your brain during your sleep and you just have a great idea."

## Collaborator Information
-   **Badub (Composer):** No relevant information found in this transcript.
-   **Biobak (Graphics Artist):** No relevant information found in this transcript (Kaze appears to be doing much of the 3D modeling and texture work himself in this stream).
-   **Zeina (Animations):**
    -   Provided animations for the game's end cutscene. Kaze mentions, "I still also need to do the end cutscene, but I was waiting for the animations for Zena first. They took a while."
    -   Kaze also mentions a personal interaction: "Me and Zeyna, we went out and we made a cool... We made a terrarium in a closed jar."
-   **Other Contributors:**
    -   **Rionu:** Will be handling the multi-language translation for the game. Kaze mentions, "Multi-language support is possible... because there's this really annoying guy called Rionu... he says he's going to translate that."
    -   **Nata:** Provided a texture Kaze uses: "nata sent me this texture a while ago."
    -   **Leela (Chat user/bot):** Provides real-time feedback and inspiration. Kaze notes, "Oh, right, Leela, you're coming to make me realize I want to change something about Curse 1." and later "Thank you lila" after Leela posts a mountain image that Kaze finds inspiring.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
-   **Theme Change for Course 11:** Switched from a volcano theme to an "oil rig" theme, requiring new platform ideas. The current working name for this level is "Frantic Fleet Factory."
-   **Platform Design:** Struggling to design large, wide platforms for the oil rig that are visually interesting and not just "big cement blocks." This includes designing a blimp landing pad.
-   **Level Naming Conventions:** Levels are named using alliterations, rhymes, or other memorable stylistic devices (e.g., "Bunny Brushwoods," "All Alone Bubble Dome," "Ghoul Guy Galleon," "Frantic Fleet Factory").
-   **Course 1 Redesign:** Adding more verticality to the first star of Course 1, potentially using a tree/mushroom and repositioning a windmill for a more engaging path.
-   **Mission Structure for Course 11:** Detailed planning for a 6-mission structure:
    1.  Mess with workers.
    2.  Workers strike; player operates a crane to break a Bowser statue.
    3.  Crane climb mission.
    4.  Power generator mission.
    5.  Blimp pad mission.
    6.  Underwater 8-bit pipe.
-   **Visual Design of Course 11:** Experimenting with "ocean spires" or large rock formations inspired by various Mario games (New Super Mario Bros., Mario World) to create verticality and define spaces, integrated with oil rig structures.
-   **Technical Limitations:** Constantly aware of N64 hardware constraints, such as polygon counts ("This level is going to absolutely murder the triangles") and texture memory, influencing design choices.
-   **Player Navigation:** Acknowledges the challenge of making surfaces clearly standable/non-standable, especially on complex geometry like the proposed spires.
-   **Platforming Mechanics for Course 11:** Brainstorming includes moving platforms, trains, platforms on hooks, seesaw platforms, shipping containers, zip lines, and cannons.

## Business Aspects
-   **Game Name Searchability:** Considers "Return to Yoshi's Island 64" might not be the most searchable name, indicating an awareness of discoverability.
-   **Marketing/Release Timing:** Comments on another ROM hack's release timing near a major Nintendo release ("Breath of the Wild") as "dangerous marketing wise."
-   **Legal Risks:** Acknowledges Nintendo's history of taking action against ROM hacks after their own game releases, referring to releasing a hack at such a time as a "ballsy move."
-   No direct mentions of funding or specific distribution plans beyond the typical ROM hack release model.

## Key Quotes
-   "My heck is okay the name is weird i'm planning to call it return to yoshi's island 64 that's the current name but like it might not be the most searchable name so..."
-   "So this is actually going to be a bit difficult because now that we switch to the oil rig theming we need some new platform ideas."
-   "Designing something is not just about coming up with ideas it's about solving whatever problem you have in design."
-   "This level feels like it's starting really rough yeah yeah that's always how it goes let's see how this looks with a good rock texture."
-   "I feel like there are so many video games where there is no solution right off the bat... That's not the freedom I want games to give me, you know."

## Potential Interview Topics
-   **Thematic Evolution of Levels:** Explore the decision-making process behind significant theme changes, such as Course 11 moving from a volcano to an oil rig, and how this impacts gameplay and asset creation.
-   **Kaze's Design Philosophy on Player Freedom:** Delve deeper into his views on player agency and how he attempts to implement "freedom" in "Return to Yoshi's Island 64" compared to other games.
-   **Iterative Design and Community Influence:** Discuss how live streaming and direct community feedback (e.g., from users like Leela) shape the iterative development of levels and mechanics.
-   **Balancing Ambition with N64 Limitations:** Investigate the strategies and creative workarounds Kaze employs to realize complex level designs (like the multi-mission oil rig) within the N64's technical constraints.
-   **Collaboration Dynamics:** Understand how Kaze coordinates with contributors like Zeina (animations) and Rionu (translation), manages tasks, and integrates their work into his vision.
