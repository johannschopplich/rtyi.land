## Game Development Process
-   The stream shows active development on various aspects of "Return to Yoshi's Island," including boss fights (the "block boss," referred to sometimes as the "all-black boss"), cutscenes, star select screens, and specific level assets like a submarine and an animated bird for a level select backdrop.
-   Development involves iterative cycles of implementation, testing, and refinement, often in direct response to collaborator feedback (e.g., Biomech's requests for visuals).
-   Significant time is spent on debugging and troubleshooting technical issues related to N64 hardware limitations, custom tools (Fast64), rendering, and animation.
-   Kaze mentions working on significant portions of the game, like the "All-Black Boss," off-stream.
-   There's a clear process of planning and designing new game areas, such as level themes and "Retro Sections."
-   Kaze is moving to a new house, which will temporarily affect his streaming schedule but will result in a new dedicated workspace ("Kaze dungeon").

## Personal Insights
-   Kaze expresses a strong desire to understand the root cause of technical problems rather than just finding a workaround: "You can't just be like, oh it works good enough. You have to be like why the fuck is it not doing what I expect? to do."
-   He values his community's engagement but maintains creative control, often injecting humor into his interactions and decisions regarding the stream itself (e.g., "I thought this was funnier" regarding stream title).
-   He has opinions on game design elements ("Music level sounds like shit. I don't actually like that idea.") and isn't afraid to voice them or change plans.
-   Kaze shows pride in his work, particularly when his YouTube content performs well: "This one's doing numbers... This video got more views in like not even two hours than most videos get like a day."
-   He reflects on the nature of game development: "Honestly, people say that everything in game development takes so long, but considering how big of a part this game is, and how much we just got done here, doesn't seem that much of a big deal to me."

## Collaborator Information
-   **Badub:** No relevant information found in this transcript.
-   **Biobak (Biomech):** Appears to be a key collaborator, likely responsible for graphics, visual design, and specific asset requests. Kaze spends significant time implementing and troubleshooting Biobak's requests, such as animations for the star select screen, lighting effects, and the submarine. There's a direct back-and-forth: "This is not the fuck biomech wanted," "Okay, I think this is doing the thing that Biobank wants." Biobak also seems to work on star select screens independently ("Let's look at bio bags other star selects").
-   **Zeina:** Mentioned in the context of a previous project ("Donkey Donkey Mario 64," where she apparently contributed to dialogue: "No, seriously, who made the dialogue for that toad? I will not disclose. I will protect their identity. Haha.") and as someone Kaze plays games with. Her direct involvement in "Return to Yoshi's Island" is not detailed in this transcript beyond being a known associate Kaze interacts with.
-   **Other Contributors:**
    -   **Skellux:** Mentioned as the inspiration for the "pink bob-omb" character in Kaze's previous game, "Donkey Donkey Mario 64."
    -   **Master True:** Kaze mentions seeing "Runmic being made" by him, possibly referring to a tool or technique.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
-   **Boss Design:** The "block boss" fight is being worked on, with considerations for difficulty ("this boss is a bit too hard right now, especially once we add these things going down") and introductory cutscenes.
-   **Level Themes:** Active discussion and decision-making on level themes, including ideas like Wild West, casino, comic book superhero, Arctic/ice cream, and desert island. Some ideas are rejected (e.g., music level, Minus World).
-   **Retro Sections:** Plans for several "Retro Sections" based on classic Nintendo games: Paper Mario 64 (Goomba Town), Mario Paint, Dr. Mario, Mario Land 1, and Smash 64. Kaze is open to changing these if better ideas emerge.
-   **Technical Challenges:**
    -   Frequent rendering issues, including problems with vertex colors, combiners, and texture formats ("This is gonna look a little crunchy on the n64").
    -   A significant bug with a sine wave function due to a compiler issue where it linked "garbage data" without warning about a missing include (`math.h`).
    -   Debugging animation logic, such as the bird's take-off sequence on the level select screen ("Everything just freezes when I press A").
    -   Optimizing performance ("setting fuck on every single one of these it's kind of bad performance wise").
-   **Asset Creation & Animation:** Detailed work on animating a submarine with sine waves and a bird for a level select screen, including troubleshooting visual glitches and behavior.
-   **Star Placement:** A design guideline is mentioned: "in RTY I actually have the guideline that every star is exactly 300 rounds off the floor... Or no, every star is 200 floors, boxes are 300."
-   **Overworld Design:** The overworld is planned for a complete rework, with a "tropical island" theme inspired by Mario Party.

## Business Aspects
-   **YouTube Content:** Kaze monitors the performance of his YouTube videos ("This one's doing numbers") and mentions an upcoming video on the "fast inverse square root algorithm." This suggests YouTube is an important platform for outreach and community engagement.
-   **Streaming:** Decisions about stream titles and content are made with an eye for engagement and humor. He mentions an upcoming move and potential "bonus streams" or a week off, indicating streaming is a regular commitment.
-   **Monetization (Minor):** Briefly dismisses pinning a comment for money ("The views I lose from having unnecessary stuff like that pinned is far outweighing your five bucks."), but humorously adds "Actually do send me the money, but I'm still not doing it." This suggests direct fan funding isn't a primary driver for in-stream decisions.
-   **Release/Distribution:** No specific plans for release date or distribution methods are mentioned in this transcript, beyond the ongoing development of the ROM hack itself.

## Key Quotes
-   "You can't just be like, oh it works good enough. You have to be like why the fuck is it not doing what I expect? to do." (Reflects Kaze's dedication to understanding and solving technical issues thoroughly.)
-   "What the fuck how can it just link garbage data and not tell me... Because I would did not include the sine function needed for this and it still compiled the sine function somehow out of nothing." (Highlights a particularly frustrating and perplexing technical challenge.)
-   "I feel like I did 90% of the work on the Black Boss actually just off stream and not on stream, because every time I come on stream, there's a different thing that I have to do." (Provides insight into his work process and the nature of live development streams.)
-   "This is not the fuck biomech wanted... Okay, I think this is doing the thing that Biobank wants." (Illustrates the collaborative and iterative process with Biobak.)

## Potential Interview Topics
-   **The Kaze-Biobak Collaboration:** Explore the dynamic between Kaze and Biobak. How do they share visions, handle creative differences, and iterate on designs for "Return to Yoshi's Island"?
-   **Navigating N64 Limitations:** Delve into Kaze's strategies for overcoming the technical hurdles of N64 development, particularly the "decompilation" aspect, and how these limitations shape the game's design.

-   **The Philosophy Behind Level Design and Retro Sections:** What guides Kaze's choices for level themes and the selection/implementation of "Retro Sections"? How does he aim to balance nostalgia with new gameplay experiences?
