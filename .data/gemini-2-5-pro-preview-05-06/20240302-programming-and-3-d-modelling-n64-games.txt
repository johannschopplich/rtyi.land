## Game Development Process
-   Current focus is on animating and programming Non-Player Characters (NPCs), specifically Dry Bones, a "Piano Guy," and "Cow Boshy." This includes implementing walk/run cycles, interaction animations (like Dry Bones crumbling when jumped on), and unique behaviors (like a shootout minigame with Cow Boshy).
-   Kaze is working on a "secret" collaboration level with a creator named Aza, which is intended for both "Return to Yoshi's Island" and a separate competition (likely the SM64DS Hacking Competition - SEC).
-   There's an ongoing effort to address performance issues, attributed to "program pooling," which seems to be a known limitation Kaze is working within.
-   Sound design is being implemented for NPCs, including footstep sounds and reaction sounds, with consideration for sound priority and fall-off.
-   Texture optimization is actively being done (e.g., for the Piano Guy model) to save memory.
-   The development process is iterative, with Kaze implementing features, testing them in-game, and making adjustments based on how they feel and look (e.g., Dry Bones walk animation choice, animation speeds).

## Personal Insights
-   Kaze strongly values "intrinsic motivation" in game design, preferring gameplay that is inherently fun and engaging over systems that rely on external rewards. He contrasts games like Tears of the Kingdom (high intrinsic motivation) with Pokémon (feeling more like a "job" due to extrinsic motivation).
-   He believes Super Mario 64 is "special" due to its unique physics and movement, which no subsequent game has replicated, making it a prime candidate for ROM hacking.
-   Kaze has a direct and often critical communication style, expressing strong opinions on various topics, including streaming culture (dislike for "farming parasocials") and what he perceives as narcissistic behavior.
-   He shows a pragmatic approach to development, acknowledging limitations (like performance) and working within them or finding practical solutions.
-   He often thinks aloud, explaining his design choices and technical reasoning to his audience during the stream.

## Collaborator Information
-   **Badub:** No relevant information found in this transcript regarding Badub's involvement.
-   **Biobak:**
    -   Kaze shares previews of unreleased content with Biobank via DMs (e.g., the secret collab level).
    -   Kaze asks Biobank for a technical shortcut/hotkey related to his development tools, suggesting Biobank has technical knowledge Kaze respects.
    -   It's implied Biobank is a trusted member of Kaze's inner circle for feedback, though specific contributions to RTYI assets are not detailed in this transcript.
-   **Zeina (Zayna):**
    -   Zayna is a key collaborator providing animations for multiple NPCs, including the Dry Bones, the "Piano Guy," and "Cow Boshy."
    -   Kaze directly praises Zayna's animation work ("Zayna, the Dry Bones look really, really good in-game. You will love them.").
    -   Kaze processes models and textures provided by Zayna, sometimes making adjustments for optimization or engine compatibility (e.g., simplifying Piano Guy's textures, fixing UVs).
-   **Other Contributors:**
    -   **Aza:** Collaborating with Kaze on a level. Both are making a level for a "call up" (collaboration) that will also feature in the "SEC" (likely SM64DS Hacking Competition).
    -   **Sauron:** Mentioned as someone Kaze might collaborate with to debug an issue with "fpdx" in the future.
    -   **Cargo:** Creator of the "Summer Cart" (an N64 flashcart for development), which Kaze discusses and intends to purchase. Not a direct RTYI contributor, but relevant to Kaze's development toolkit.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
-   **NPC Behavior and Animation:**
    -   Choosing between different walk animations for Dry Bones (settling on a "zombie walk" that fits the character).
    -   Scaling animation speeds with NPC walking speeds for a more natural look.
    -   Designing the Dry Bones to crumble when jumped on, similar to its behavior in official Mario games.
    -   Developing a shootout minigame with Cow Boshy, including a countdown, reaction-based shooting, and dialogue.
    -   Making the Cow Boshy duel progressively easier if the player loses, to ensure accessibility.
-   **Level Design and Aesthetics:**
    -   Discussion of a "retro stage" (Amara Desert 64 from Mario Kart 64) and justifying its "ugly" aesthetic as fitting for a retro-themed area.
    -   Optimizing textures for NPCs like the Piano Guy to save memory and fit N64 limitations.
-   **Technical Challenges:**
    -   Persistent performance issues ("program pooling") that affect frame rate. Kaze acknowledges this as a general problem.
    -   Fixing issues with new fast Piranha DirectX (fpdx) being too slow, requiring future debugging.
    -   Ensuring correct sound implementation, including managing sound priorities to prevent sounds from cutting each other out (e.g., barrel sounds muting other noises).
    -   Debugging NPC interaction logic, such as characters not initiating dialogue correctly.
-   **Dialogue and Story:**
    -   Writing "cowboy-themed" dialogue for Cow Boshy, aiming for an "arrogant, angsty, edgy" persona.
    -   Considering player dialogue choices (e.g., "Yeah partner" vs. "Nary a bit") for interactions.

## Business Aspects
-   **Exposure over Monetization:** Kaze mentions a "double cash in" strategy for the collab level with Aza, referring to gaining exposure by featuring the level in both "Return to Yoshi's Island" and the SEC competition, rather than direct financial gain.
-   **Consideration for Future Projects:** When discussing a hypothetical Wind Waker modding project, Kaze notes it would "not [be] financially worth it unless someone pays me to work on that," indicating an awareness of effort vs. financial return for large, new undertakings, though this doesn't directly apply to RTYI.
-   **No direct discussion of marketing, funding, or specific release/distribution plans for "Return to Yoshi's Island" was found in this transcript.**

## Key Quotes
-   "Mario 64 there's something very unique about it and that is the physics the movement that no other game coming after it can replicate so Mario 64 is still kind of special in that sense." (Explaining his motivation for hacking SM64)
-   "playing Pokemon kind of feels like a job because you kind of just get the extrinsic motivation whereas if you play a game like um Tears of the Kingdom... that's pure intrinsic motivation." (Highlighting his game design philosophy)
-   "Zayna, the Dry Bones look really, really good in-game. You will love them." (Showcasing collaboration and appreciation for a contributor's work)
-   "you know what causes the game to have so many performance issues yeah it's just program pooling it is what it is." (Acknowledging a significant technical challenge)
