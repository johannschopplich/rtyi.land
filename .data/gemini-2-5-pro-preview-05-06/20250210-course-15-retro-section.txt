## Game Development Process
- The game "Return to Yoshi's Island" (RTYI) is actively in development, with Kaze Emanuar working on level design and technical implementation.
- Significant progress is being made on the final "retro pipe" level, which is themed around Mario 64 and aims to incorporate elements from all original Mario 64 levels.
- The overworld of Yoshi's Island is a major component that still requires substantial work and will consist of multiple sections.
- Development involves iterative design, with Kaze working through level layouts (e.g., volcano section, slide section, town section), addressing memory constraints, and fixing graphical issues like UV mapping.
- Kaze mentions working on various level concepts including a water level, areas with merry-go-rounds, a Toxic Maze, Volcano Climb, Leaf Pyramid, and a section involving flying from pillow to pillow with a Wing Cap.
- Memory management is a recurring concern, with Kaze needing to optimize and be mindful of RAM limitations for the N64.

## Personal Insights
- Kaze expresses a complex attitude towards Nintendo: he's aware of and somewhat expects a takedown for RTYI but also sees it as a potential PR opportunity or a catalyst to develop an original commercial game. He states, "Yeah this game is definitely going to be taken down by Nintendo at some point That's why we do need a better plan with it."
- He is passionate about improving upon the original Mario 64's technical aspects, aiming to fix issues like "fucked up UV coordinates" while largely maintaining the "vanilla shitty aesthetic."
- Kaze acknowledges his streaming style, stating, "Please keep note that when I'm streaming I am yapping, and when I'm yapping I do not remember anything I say."
- He shows a willingness to address community concerns, such as modifying a potentially offensive level ("Chess" level) based on feedback.

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub (composer):** No specific contributions to "Return to Yoshi's Island" mentioned in this transcript.
- **Biobak (graphics artist):** No specific contributions to "Return to Yoshi's Island" mentioned in this transcript. (A "Biotech" is mentioned for level design on a separate commissioned project, "Drug Mario.")
- **Zeina (animations):** No specific contributions to "Return to Yoshi's Island" mentioned in this transcript. (Kaze mentions watching anime with "Zainab," which might be a personal acquaintance or a typo).
- **Other Contributors (for RTYI or providing general support):**
    - **Decoy (stream viewer):** Provided significant real-time feedback on RTYI level design, particularly suggesting splitting levels more, which Kaze found valuable and agreed to implement. Kaze offered Decoy the opportunity to design a section.
    - **Mayamek (community member):** Mentioned in relation to the "Chess" level, indicating Mayamek was likely aware of or involved in the original design or discussion about its intent.
    - **Wameg (community creator):** Creator of "Only Up 64," a game that inspired the concept for RTYI's final retro pipe section.
    - **Yoshi Party (stream viewer, likely):** Thanked for providing an expanded ROM, which aids development.
    - **The second unabandoned (commissioner):** Commissioned Kaze for the separate "Drug Mario" project.
    - **Biotech (collaborator on "Drug Mario"):** Credited with making most of the levels for the "Drug Mario" commissioned project.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Censorship/Redesign of "Chess" Level:** A level with political themes ("all koopas are bastards") and flags perceived as offensive by some in the LGBT community is being redesigned to feature Bowser flags and "anti-Bowser protest" elements to mitigate offense.
- **Ambitious "Retro Pipe" Final Level:** Designing a section to include elements from all Mario 64 levels simultaneously, inspired by "Only Up 64."
- **Memory Management:** A consistent challenge is working within the N64's RAM limits, requiring low-detail models and careful optimization. Kaze notes, "Our main issue here is that we are running out of memory." (Though later checks suggest more space, indicating it's a fluctuating or section-specific concern).
- **Level Splitting and Flow:** Kaze is actively working on splitting levels into smaller, more fragmented sections based on feedback (from "Decoy") to improve difficulty and player experience.
- **Maintaining "Vanilla" Aesthetic While Improving Flaws:** A core design goal is to keep the N64 look and feel but fix technical shortcomings like UV mapping.
- **Player Accessibility and Skips:** Kaze aims for the game to be beatable without extended movesets or the Wing Cap, but still wants to allow for creative player skips. He states, "I want player to at least be creative when they skip something, otherwise it's not fun."
- **Technical Limitations:** Dealing with issues like "fucked up UV coordinates," ensuring proper texture application (including vertex colors), and managing render distances within engine capabilities.

## Business Aspects
- **Contingency Plan for Nintendo Takedown:** Kaze frequently discusses the likelihood of Nintendo taking down the ROM hack. His plan is to use this as a "PR move" and redevelop the project into an original game ("Return to Dinosaur Island") to be sold on platforms like Steam. He views this as a "win-win" situation.
- **Monetization of Original Game:** "In fact, I kind of almost want them to take a bow, because then I have an excuse to just turn this into my own game and sell it on Steam or something."
- **Paid Commission Work:** Kaze mentions a separate "paid commission" project, "Drug Mario," indicating he undertakes monetized game development work outside of his personal ROM hacking projects.

## Key Quotes
- "I'm not scared of the Nintendo Ninjas. I am fully aware that I might get taken down, but if that happens, we can use that to spin some PR moves, and just rewrite the game into my own custom game." - Kaze Emanuar on potential Nintendo action.
- "The retro section is not just level lava then, it's going to be every Mario 64 level at the same time. We're going to be retroing out so much." - Kaze Emanuar on the ambition for the final level of RTYI.
- "Our main issue here is that we are running out of memory. So we have to keep this somewhat low detail." - Kaze Emanuar on a recurring development challenge.
