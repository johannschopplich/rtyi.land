## Game Development Process
-   Kaze is actively working on a cutscene where a boss eats Mario and then spits him out at the fighting arena for "Return to Yoshi's Island."
-   Development includes scripting a sequence involving an interaction with Bowser, after which his minions disappear, the environment becomes quiet, and a new character is supposed to appear.
-   This specific sequence is described as a "work in progress," indicating iterative development and bug fixing (e.g., the new character not appearing correctly).
-   There's a focus on environmental storytelling and atmosphere (e.g., "everyone's gone it's quiet you don't know what's happening").

## Personal Insights
-   Kaze expresses positive feedback on the game's current state, particularly the movement: "wow the movement in this game is so cool."
-   He has an ambitious idea for a separate YouTube video ("i hacked every nintendo 64 game") inspired by Mr. Beast's style, aiming for "blitz content" with short, funny segments of N64 game hacks.
-   Kaze shows a pragmatic and somewhat controversial approach to content creation, stating about potentially misrepresenting the timeline for his "Mr. Beast" style video idea: "it's literally just gonna be a lie though i don't care though it doesn't matter."

## Collaborator Information
-   **Badub (composer):** Not explicitly named in this transcript. However, Kaze mentions a specific area ("moses office," likely a misremembering of Bowser's office) "will definitely have a custom song," which implies the work of a composer like Badub.
-   **Biobak (graphics artist):** No relevant information found in this transcript.
-   **Zeina (animations):** No relevant information found in this transcript.
-   **Other Contributors:**
    -   An unnamed individual is physically present with Kaze during the stream, assisting with a technical issue (broken speakers). Their role in game development, if any, is not specified in this transcript.
    -   "Johann Schepplich" is mentioned as a new YouTube channel member, indicating community support.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
-   **Design Choice:** Creating a sequence where players talk to Bowser, his minions then disappear, the music stops, and the atmosphere becomes quiet to build tension before a new character appears.
-   **Challenge:** A bug where the new character ("this guy") is not appearing correctly ("oh god you can't even see him no he was supposed to come meet you"). This is acknowledged as a "work in progress."
-   **Design Choice:** Implementing custom music for specific game areas, such as the "moses office" (likely Bowser's office), to enhance the atmosphere.
-   **Challenge (Stream-related):** The stream was temporarily suspended due to a policy violation related to copyrighted music ("evangelion song"), hindering the live showcase of development. Kaze also sought tips for OBS performance.

## Business Aspects
-   Kaze is actively thinking about YouTube content strategy to grow his channel, exemplified by the "Mr. Beast N64 hacking video" idea, which could indirectly promote his game projects.
-   He utilizes YouTube channel memberships as a form of community engagement and potential support, as seen by him thanking a new member.
-   No direct mentions of specific funding models, release dates, or distribution plans for "Return to Yoshi's Island" itself were found in this transcript.
