## Game Development Process
- Active development is focused on Course 14 (papercraft level, pyramid interior sub-area) and Course 15 ("war level," difficult sub-area completed off-stream).
- Course 14 is nearing completion, with "only two areas missing in the papercraft level."
- A demo for Course 1 is considered "fully finished" and just needs to be "made ready."
- Kaze mentions significant work ("a lot of stuff done") happens off-stream.
- The project involves iterative design, with ideas being brainstormed, implemented, tested, and sometimes discarded.
- Bug fixing is an ongoing part of the process (e.g., the newly discovered BLJ bug).

## Personal Insights
- Kaze believes "a little bit of difficulty is fun" and intentionally designs challenging sections, while also being wary of making them *too* difficult.
- He values world-building and the "in-between" moments in games, drawing inspiration from "Majora's Mask."
- He expresses a desire for players to experience initial confusion that resolves into understanding, rather than straightforward guidance.
- Kaze is open about his development process, including frustrations and changes in direction (e.g., "This layout sucks").
- He has specific preferences for game mechanics, such as not wanting the 100-coin star to be part of 100% completion.
- He reflects on past projects and collaborations, and shares opinions on other games (e.g., disliking Mario 64 DS).

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub:** Not explicitly mentioned for "Return to Yoshi's Island" in this transcript, but Kaze references his music for "Zero Worlds," indicating a past working relationship as a composer.
- **Biobak:** A graphics artist who provides suggestions on visual elements. For instance, "Biobank was saying maybe cardboard where paper is stapled onto it" as an alternative to a Styrofoam look. Kaze also mentions discussing Twitter analytics with him.
- **Zeina (Zaina):** Heavily involved in playtesting, particularly for difficult sections. Kaze notes, "when Zaina played and she had trouble beating it [Course 15 sub-area], But I think the difficulty is fine considering its course 15." She serves as a benchmark for difficulty. Kaze also mentions general discussions, "me and now do two minutes of story."
- **Other Contributors:**
    - **Kinokyo:** Mentioned as having made a level "so pretty" in another of Kaze's ROM hacks.
    - **Chat members (Chris, James, Parker, Links, Sarah, etc.):** Contribute suggestions and engage in discussions during the stream, influencing Kaze's thought process.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Pyramid Interior (Course 14 Sub-area):**
    - Goal: Create a "contrived cave system," initially confusing but ultimately understandable, not a true labyrinth. "The confusion needs to resolve."
    - Ideas explored: Landmarks, visible maze structures, three stories, one-way paths, color-coding, a large central cliff revealing paths, and finally settling on "one main path with a bunch of small paths along it that connect back to the main path" for the 8 red coins.
    - Challenge: Avoiding strategies like "follow the left wall" by using one-way paths to force engagement.
- **Difficulty Balancing:** A recurring concern, especially for later courses like Course 15. Kaze aims for challenging but fair gameplay, using Zeina's feedback.
- **Course 15 Sub-area:** Designed to be "by far the most difficult area in the game," featuring timed saws with rubber-banding speed and color-coded elements.
- **Global Coin System:** Discussing how to make players aware that coins are global and not per-level for a 100-coin star. Ideas include starting the player with coins or using a four-digit coin counter.
- **Bug Fixing:** The accidental discovery of a BLJ (Backwards Long Jump) bug is noted as "a very important bug to fix."
- **Aesthetics:** The papercraft theme of Course 14 presents unique visual challenges, like making Styrofoam look good.

## Business Aspects
- **Social Media Marketing:** Kaze discusses Twitter posting times for better visibility ("if you don't post at a certain time of the day, then no one sees it") and schedules posts. He also notes Twitter impression numbers and speculates on potential ad revenue, though not as a primary income.
- **Monetization (Indirect):** Kaze shares his YouTube analytics, stating he made "$900 this month" or "$10,000 in a year" from YouTube, which supports his work but is "not that much."
- **Release Plans:** A "release will be tomorrow" comment is likely a stream joke. However, a demo for Course 1 is genuinely being prepared. The original RTYI demo timeline (3-4 months for 4 levels) and a full polish timeline (end of 2024) are mentioned.

## Key Quotes
- "I do want this to feel like a contrived Have system almost but not like a labyrinth So that's hard to do I The confusion needs to resolve that's a difficult part here." (On the pyramid level design philosophy)
- "This is definitely the hardest star in the game so far... I Think it's really really cool to just worry that it's too difficult." (On balancing challenge and playability)
- "But the idea of one main path with a bunch of small paths along it that connect back to the main path, I think that works." (On settling on a design for the pyramid interior after much brainstorming)

## Potential Interview Topics
- **The "Resolving Confusion" Design Philosophy:** Explore Kaze's core idea of creating levels that are initially disorienting but become clear through player exploration and understanding. How does he approach designing for this specific player journey?
- **Collaboration Dynamics:** Delve deeper into how Kaze works with Zeina (playtesting, feedback loop) and Biobak (graphics, art style). How does their input shape the game's development and final form?
- **Balancing Difficulty and Player Experience:** Discuss Kaze's approach to crafting challenging gameplay in RTYI. How does he determine what's "fun difficult" versus "frustrating difficult," especially in later game stages like Course 15?
- **Evolution of a Level (e.g., Pyramid Interior):** Trace the development of a complex area like the Course 14 pyramid interior, from initial concept through various discarded ideas to the final design. What does this reveal about his iterative process?
- **The Role of Streaming in Development:** How does live streaming and interacting with the community influence Kaze's design decisions, problem-solving, and motivation for the project?
