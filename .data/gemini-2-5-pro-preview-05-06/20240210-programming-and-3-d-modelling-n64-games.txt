## Game Development Process
- Currently focused on the "cowboy level" (also referred to as "mole hideout"), specifically implementing Monty Mole enemy behavior and a boss fight.
- Significant off-stream progress is made; the stream often shows debugging and refinement.
- The game is stated to be approximately 80% complete, with "three more main courses and two side levels and one bowser level" remaining.
- Key development tasks include physics calculations for projectiles, AI behavior scripting, level scripting, and boss encounter design.
- A major milestone achieved is a completely new, more stable collision system, replacing the original Mario 64 one.
- Iterative development is evident, with Kaze working through bugs (e.g., rock spawning, moles shooting offset) and refining mechanics live.
- Star 1 and 2 for the current level are considered done, with work progressing on Star 3 ("Goomba imposter tower").

## Personal Insights
- Kaze expresses strong opinions on game mechanics, such as his disdain for the original SM64 collision system ("It is unusable") and his pride in his custom solution ("it's so much more stable").
- He has a nuanced philosophy on bugs: "if there's a bug in Mario 64 that you only encounter if you do it on purpose, I'll leave it in the game. But if it can happen on accident, I'll remove it." He specifically wants to keep BLJ possible if he can.
- Kaze values player experience and feeling over literal interpretations of critique: "I try to figure out like what the person was feeling that's wrong... seeing if I can address their feeling instead of their actual critique."
- He is ambitious, not only in overhauling core game systems but also in his future plans to develop an original commercial game.
- He is candid about the development process, including frustrations (e.g., with physics math) and moments of discovery.

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub (composer):** No specific mention of Badub or their contributions in this transcript segment.
- **Biobak (graphics artist):** No specific mention of Biobak or their contributions in this transcript segment.
- **Zeina (animator):**
    - Her animation work is implied as crucial for game polish. Kaze notes a "to do: add animations" for the Monty Moles, stating, "to effectively make this faster I think I need the animations."
    - A playful comment suggests "quaternion animations" are a known, perhaps complex, task ("Lila will only vote for you if you promise that you will force a few programmers to finish quaternion animations").
- **Other Contributors:**
    - **CX links:** Kaze asks, "Hello CX links, we already got any OST wishes today," which might imply CX links is involved with music selection or contribution, but their role is not clearly defined.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **New Collision System:** A major decision to replace SM64's collision entirely due to its perceived instability. This new system is a point of pride but also led to unintended consequences like removing BLJ initially.
- **Projectile Physics:** Kaze struggled with calculating the Y-velocity for projectiles (rocks thrown by Moles), initially trying ChatGPT for help before solving it with manual physics equations. This involved understanding motion under gravity.
- **Boss Fight Design (Monty Moles):**
    - Initial ideas involved a set number of moles that get faster, or a survival wave. These were iterated upon due to concerns about being "boring" or visually cluttered.
    - The chosen design involves moles popping out of random holes, requiring the player to react. Kaze specifically scripted this behavior: "they pick a random hole to come out of."
    - Thematic consistency is considered (e.g., "No, I don't like hard hats, because this is a cowboy level").
- **Bug Fixing & Iteration:** Constant process of identifying and fixing bugs, such as moles shooting with an offset, interaction issues, and incorrect coin spawning.
- **Balancing Intentional vs. Accidental Bugs:** Kaze aims to remove bugs that hinder player experience accidentally but is open to keeping bugs that players seek out intentionally (like BLJ).
- **RAM Management:** Mentioned removing collision on a bridge in the cowboy level "for RAM reasons for now," indicating technical constraints of the N64 platform.

## Business Aspects
- **Future Original Game & Kickstarter:** Kaze explicitly states, "I'm planning like alongside the release of return to your silent I'll probably launch like a Kickstarter for my own game and then transition to working on that and then hopefully I can hire some other rom hackers to work on it with me actually."
- **Experience with Sponsorships:** Kaze recounts a negative experience with a company that sponsored an ad for a handheld device, indicating his awareness of his channel's value ("usually for an ad you get like $3,000"). This provides context for his potential approach to funding future projects.
- No direct marketing or distribution plans for "Return to Yoshi's Island" itself were mentioned in this transcript, which is typical for a ROM hack.

## Key Quotes
- "I made a completely new collision system. I said, fuck Mario 64's collision. It is unusable. We have our completely own collision system now. And it's so much more stable." (Highlights technical ambition and improvement over the original)
- "I'm not trying to prevent the BLJ. It's more so that just by making more stable physics, it just so happened to remove BLJ. And I consider that a bad thing, actually. Ideally, BLJ would still be possible." (Shows his design philosophy regarding iconic game mechanics and emergent play)
- "I mean the levels are left to make after this three more main courses and two side levels and one bowser level we're like 80% of the way there" (Provides a clear status update on the project's overall completion)
- "I'm planning like alongside the release of return to your silent I'll probably launch like a Kickstarter for my own game and then transition to working on that..." (Indicates future aspirations beyond ROM hacking)

## Potential Interview Topics
- **The Custom Collision System:** Delve into the motivations, challenges, and impact of replacing such a fundamental part of Mario 64. What were the specific issues with the original, and what new possibilities does his system open up?
- **Design Philosophy for a "Sequel" Hack:** Explore how Kaze balances innovation with faithfulness to the original game. How does he decide what to keep, what to change, and what to add when working within the framework of a beloved classic?
- **Collaboration in ROM Hacking:** Discuss the dynamics of working with collaborators like Zeina (animations), and potentially Badub (music) and Biobak (graphics, if they are involved). How are tasks divided and integrated in a distributed, passion-driven project?
- **The Future of Kaze Emanuar:** Expand on his plans for the Kickstarter and his vision for an original 3D platformer. What lessons from ROM hacking will he bring to commercial game development?
- **The Role of the SM64 Decompilation:** How has the decompilation project enabled or changed his approach to creating "Return to Yoshi's Island" compared to older ROM hacking methods?
