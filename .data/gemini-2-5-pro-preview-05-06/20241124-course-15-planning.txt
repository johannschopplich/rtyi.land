## Game Development Process
- The game "Return to Yoshi's Island" is in an advanced stage of development.
- Kaze is currently focused on designing Course 15, "Asteroid Arcade" (or "Space Arcade"), which is the last main course. Assets for this level are already largely complete.
- A demo of the game (featuring Course 1) is "basically done" and planned for release shortly after Christmas (e.g., "first of next year," "By February 2025").
- Kaze mentions completing other parts of the game off-stream, such as "Bomb Camp."
- He is also working on a separate project/feature called "Mario Expansion," which involves porting Banjo-Kazooie enemies to the SM64 engine.
- The development process for levels appears to involve asset creation first, followed by Kaze's detailed level design and implementation.

## Personal Insights
- Kaze is highly passionate and ambitious for the project, aiming to create "banger levels" and considers Course 15 to have "insane potential."
- He has a strong design philosophy focused on "Fun, freedom," and "evok[ing] awe," as well as "edging the player" (building anticipation).
- He engages in a methodical, iterative design process, often thinking aloud and weighing different options to solve design challenges, such as balancing linearity with openness.
- Kaze is self-reflective, at one point wondering if he's "holding my game to way too high of a standard" when comparing his approach to commercial games like Mario Galaxy.
- He values originality, expressing concern about accidentally using ideas already implemented by other creators (e.g., DanGPTV).

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub (composer):** No direct mention or information about Badub's contributions in this specific transcript.
- **Biobak (graphics artist):** No direct mention by name, but Kaze states, "We already got a lot of assets for it done that you can see floating through space here in the backgrounds... Using assets these assets weren't a scuttlebug hack, but they were made for this ROM hack." This implies significant graphical asset work has been completed, presumably by artists like Biobak.
- **Zeina (animations):** No direct mention or information about Zeina's contributions in this specific transcript.
- **Other Contributors:**
    - **Chris15:** Credited with the theme for Course 15: "Chris15's theme is Space Arcade." This suggests a conceptual contribution for the level.
    - **DanGPTV:** Mentioned as another creator whose work Kaze is aware of. Kaze checked if an idea was "stolen from Dan" and decided against it as DanGPTV had already implemented something similar. Not a direct collaborator, but an influence/community figure.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Course 15 ("Asteroid Arcade") Design:**
    - **Core Goals:** "Fun, freedom," evoke "awe," create an "adventure into space."
    - **Main Challenge:** Achieving a sense of openness and player freedom while ensuring clear goals and avoiding excessive linearity. Kaze states, "How do we make it feel open despite being linear? That's a challenge."
    - **Structural Ideas:** Explored a central hub (rocket ship), multiple paths, teleporters (black holes), and potentially changing level layouts per star (inspired by Mario Galaxy). A key idea adopted is having "the flipper star and all the flipper platforms are below the main course and shoot you up."
    - **Star Mechanics (Arcade Games):** Brainstormed several arcade game concepts to be adapted into 3D Mario platforming challenges.
        - **Selected:** "Tetris" (survive falling pieces to reach a star) and "Pac-Mario" (Mario navigates a maze with Chain Chomps, jumping on walls to dodge).
        - **Considered/Discarded/Reassigned:** Whack-a-Mole (too similar to existing boss), rhythm game (unsure how it would work), Skee-Ball (good, possibly for a different area/mechanic), Shell Game, Hot Rope Jump (noted for a Yoshi coin).
    - **Enemies:** Planned "Space Shy Guys" (possibly lanky, with a spin attack) and "Space Skeeters" (jumping large distances).
- **Power-ups:** The Wing Cap is considered a "great power-up for this level." Low gravity zones are also planned.
- **Player Guidance:** A recurring concern is how to guide the player without explicit cutscenes or overly linear paths. Ideas include landmarks, star descriptions, and designing paths that allow visibility of other areas.

## Business Aspects
- **Demo Release Strategy:**
    - The demo is planned for release "shortly after Christmas" (e.g., "first of next year," "By February 2025").
    - This timing is partly to avoid potential issues with Nintendo, as Kaze mentions, "if you release stuff around Christmas, Nintendo gets very angry."
    - The demo will be released on Kaze's "Case Clips channel, not on the main channel."
- **Open Sourcing:** Kaze plans to "open source it [the game/engine] once it's finished" to avoid leaking the entire game prematurely.
- **Monetization/Funding:** No direct funding for "Return to Yoshi's Island" is mentioned. Kaze does state, "I'm not playing Roblox again unless they pay me again," indicating he has done sponsored content in the past, but this is not explicitly linked to RTYI's development.

## Key Quotes
- "So, design goals We definitely want Fun, freedom This is the through line And we need a way That you're going to feel like you're an adventure into space." (Defining the core experience for Course 15).
- "How do we make it feel open despite being linear? That's a challenge. I don't have an answer for that." (Highlighting a central design obstacle).
- "Progress on the demo, the demo basically done. I'm thinking I will release it shortly after Christmas, because if you release stuff around Christmas, Nintendo gets very angry." (Detailing demo release plans and considerations).
- "The flipper star and all the flipper platforms are below the main course and shoot you up if you move around it... I think this is a great idea. It's going to add so much to the feeling free thing." (A moment of design breakthrough for level structure and player movement).

## Potential Interview Topics
- Explore the collaborative workflow in more detail: How does Kaze integrate the work of Badub (music), Biobak (graphics), and Zeina (animations) into his design process for "Return to Yoshi's Island"?
- Discuss Kaze's specific design philosophy for ROM hacking: How does he balance homage to the original game with his own creative vision and desire for innovation, especially when tackling iconic themes like "Yoshi's Island"?
- Delve into the decision-making process for adapting classic arcade games (like Tetris and Pac-Man) into 3D platforming challenges for Mario. What are the unique challenges and creative opportunities in such translations?
- Ask about the significance of the SM64 decompilation project for "Return to Yoshi's Island." How has it enabled Kaze to push the boundaries of what's possible in an SM64 ROM hack?
- Inquire about Kaze's long-term vision for the project after its completion, including the implications of open-sourcing the game and engine, and his perspective on the SM64 modding community's future.
