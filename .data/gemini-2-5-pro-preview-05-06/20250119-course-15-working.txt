## Game Development Process
- Currently working on a specific level section ("Space Taxi," potentially Course 15), focusing on platforming, level flow, and connecting areas to a "black hole."
- Actively creating and importing new 3D assets (flying car, antenna concepts, gramophone, piano key staircase, retro-futuristic CRTs, flying parking lot).
- Continuous optimization is a major focus, particularly reducing triangle counts for N64 hardware performance.
- Significant time spent on bug fixing, including crashes on actual N64 hardware and collision issues.
- The hub world ("all of Yoshi's Island") is a critical component planned for later in development, considered "by far the most important part of the game."
- Iterative design process: Kaze frequently tests, evaluates, and modifies level elements and models based on feel and playability.
- Kaze mentions working on "his longest video yet" and another video about "every shader in Mario 64," indicating ongoing content creation alongside game development.

## Personal Insights
- Kaze finds some aspects of his work, like extensive video editing, "so much work and so exhausting."
- He holds strong opinions on game design, e.g., believing the hub world was "the only reason Mario 64 was famous, popular."
- He is candid about his public persona and acknowledges reasons why people might not like him personally, separating that from appreciation of his work.
- Kaze values deep work and focus, mentioning he intentionally had a "loneliest possible college experience" to dedicate time to working.
- He expresses skepticism towards some new technologies (e.g., Switch 2, Windows 11) and often prefers proven or simpler solutions.
- He reflects on the difficulty of onboarding collaborators unfamiliar with N64 development constraints, noting it can cost more time than it saves.

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub:** No specific mention of Badub's direct involvement in "Return to Yoshi's Island" in this transcript.
- **Biobak (Graphics Artist/Level Design):**
    - Kaze discussed a "Yoshi boss idea" with Biobak, agreeing with Biobak's feedback about it being "a little cryptic" and considering Biobak's alternative ideas. The boss concept involves attacking tumors inside its mouth.
    - Biobak is currently "working on course 2," and Kaze plans to do an analysis of courses before Biobak reworks them.
- **Zeina (Animations/Art):**
    - Referred to as "Zayna my wife."
    - Kaze mentions, "Zayna already drew something for them [shy guys NPCs]," indicating her contribution of art assets.
    - Implied she handles other assets: "Zayn. I'm so long bio backups with that I already have a lot of with it" (potentially meaning backups of her work).
- **Other Contributors:**
    - **Bruno Gadsen:** Sent Kaze a 3D model design for a retro-futuristic CRT which Kaze liked and decided to implement.
    - **"GBA port guy":** Collaborating with Kaze on a separate video project; this person has recorded voice lines and footage.
    - **Sauron:** Mentioned in the context of the Fast64 Discord server, providing accurate estimates on cycle savings for optimizations.
    - **Dodongo:** Mentioned as working on Lib Dragon, whose work Kaze says he "can't really use" for this project.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Platforming Design:** Kaze frequently iterates on platforming sections to ensure they are not "too awkward" or unfairly difficult, aiming for a good player experience.
- **N64 Technical Constraints:** A recurring challenge is balancing visual complexity and desired features with N64 hardware limitations (e.g., "this area is already very complex. And it's going to lag if we keep adding too much stuff to it"). This forces simplification and careful optimization (e.g., reducing triangle counts for models).
- **Asset Creation:** Designing assets that are both aesthetically pleasing (e.g., "retrofuturism") and low-poly enough for the N64 (e.g., modeling the CRT).
- **Collision and Bugs:** Dealing with collision system limits ("too many collision triangles") and debugging crashes that occur on real hardware but not always in emulators.
- **Onboarding Collaborators:** Difficulty in finding artists who understand N64-specific development, particularly shaders, which can lead to Kaze spending excessive time teaching them.
- **Hub World Significance:** The decision to make the hub world extensive and full of secrets, and to develop it last because of its perceived importance in tying the game together.
- **Player Movement:** Kaze mentions player feedback led to changes in the dive mechanic (allowing direction change but with speed loss), showing responsiveness to player experience.
- **Communicating Game Mechanics:** Thinking about how to communicate things like an impending "barrel roll" to the player.

## Business Aspects
- **Potential Steam Release:** Kaze is considering releasing the game on Steam, which would involve "replac[ing] all Nintendo assets and would kick out the last bit of Nintendo code." This indicates a plan for a version of the game independent of Nintendo IP.
- **Kickstarter Aversion:** He is "scared of using Kickstarter" due to not understanding sales tax laws and fearing financial complications.
- **Collaboration Model:** Kaze is generally not looking to pay for creative contributions for this project ("Pay me money and I'll make characters for you, then it's probably a no") but is open to free help ("if it's like oh I want to help you make the game so I'm offering my work for free then it's probably yes").
- **Content Creation for Algorithm:** He mentions creating a long video and hoping "the algorithm will bless this video," showing awareness of YouTube's platform dynamics for visibility.
- **Monetization of Past Work:** He mentions making an N64 game last year "because I was paid to do it," but doubts he'll be paid to do another, distinct from RTYI.

## Key Quotes
- "I was thinking maybe using the static recompilation to release this game both like as an n64 game with Mario and Officially as like a game on Steam... Obviously, I would replace all Nintendo assets and would kick out the last bit of Nintendo code as well." (Highlights future commercial ambitions and IP considerations).
- "The hub world is by far the most important part of the game. And you need to make sure it's perfect... The hub world is I think the only reason Mario 64 was famous, popular." (Emphasizes his design philosophy and the importance of a key game feature).
- "One problem I see with your friend helping is that he probably doesn't understand how n64 shaders work... I'm a little worried. I'm gonna have to spend so much time teaching him that he ends up costing more time than he saves, you know." (Illustrates a key challenge in collaborating on N64 projects).

## Potential Interview Topics
- **The "Return to Yoshi's Island" Vision:** Explore Kaze's overarching goals for the game, its thematic connections to Yoshi's Island and Mario 64, and what unique experience he aims to deliver beyond a typical ROM hack.
- **Navigating N64 Decompilation & Limitations:** Discuss how the Mario 64 decompilation has specifically enabled this project, and delve into the creative and technical compromises made when balancing ambitious ideas with N64 hardware constraints.
- **Collaboration Dynamics & Challenges:** Further explore his experiences working with Biobak and Zeina, his criteria for accepting external help, and the specific difficulties (like shader knowledge) in finding N64-savvy collaborators.
- **The Path to a Commercial Release:** Investigate the practical steps, challenges, and emotional considerations involved in transforming a Nintendo-based ROM hack into an original IP suitable for a platform like Steam.
- **Philosophy of Hub World Design:** Ask Kaze to elaborate on his strong views about hub worlds, what specific elements make a hub world "perfect," and how he plans to implement these ideas in "Return to Yoshi's Island" to make it "full of secrets."
