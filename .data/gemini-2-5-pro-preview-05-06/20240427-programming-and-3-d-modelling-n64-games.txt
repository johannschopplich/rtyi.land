## Game Development Process
- The stream focuses on active development, particularly brainstorming and initial design for Courses 13, 14, and 15.
- Course 13 ("gloomy ice castle") is in the art style testing and layout planning phase.
- Course 14 (decided during the stream to be "craft materials" themed) and Course 15 ("space arcade," which already has an area finished) are being planned to ensure thematic coherence and a good difficulty curve.
- Kaze mentions using a "design document" and creating a level overview to manage difficulty and player experience ("to make sure the players learn all the important controls everywhere and that the difficulty has a good curve").
- The game is stated to have "three courses missing" at one point, indicating significant progress but still key areas to complete.
- The development process is highly iterative, especially for level themes and art styles, with Kaze experimenting and seeking chat feedback.

## Personal Insights
- Kaze expresses strong opinions on emulation: "Project 64 inaccuracies, unfortunately. Right now the game has a lot of issues on a lot of emulators... You can use Parallel Launcher but I hate it."
- He has a clear design philosophy, avoiding puzzles: "Puzzles is very much against the design of this game." and focusing on boss fights as "set pieces."
- Kaze reflects on the N64's original development: "Would SM64 run faster if I recorded in Assembly instead of C? Yes. But it probably still wouldn't have come out because the Nintendo programmers are not good enough to program Mario 64 in Assembly."
- He values the "vibe" and "feeling" of levels, spending considerable time trying to achieve the desired aesthetic, as seen with Course 13.
- He differentiates his on-stream persona from his off-stream personality: "The main reason I try to talk a lot on stream is that I'm trying to be a good streamer. In real life I do not talk very much."

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub (composer):** Not explicitly mentioned by name for specific contributions in this transcript. Kaze does listen to various music tracks for inspiration (e.g., "Ice Castle songs," "Nintendo winter music," "Sonic Adventure") which is relevant to a composer's work.
- **Biobak (graphics artist):** Actively contributes ideas in chat. Kaze references Biobak's input: "What Biobank said makes sense to me. It's gonna be the Caterpillar for the Space Casino. It's gonna be dark with lots of glowing lights." This suggests Biobak is involved in conceptual and visual design.
- **Zeina (animations/art):** Kaze confirms his wife (presumably Zeina) "still makes art for this." She is also mentioned in personal anecdotes, and Kaze notes she now works in her own office.
- **Other Contributors:**
    - **Community/Chat (various users like "Lena," "Fasana"):** Plays a significant role in brainstorming, with Kaze actively soliciting and incorporating their ideas for level themes (e.g., the craft materials theme for Course 14 was heavily shaped by chat suggestions).
    - **Brodude (another SM64 ROM hacker):** Frequently mentioned, often humorously, as a point of reference for design decisions ("Because that is what we base our decisions on. On what Brody already did. Yeah.").

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Emulator Incompatibility:** A major recurring challenge is ensuring the game runs correctly on various N64 emulators. "So we currently have some issues in the game on Project 64 where some levels crash... Right now the game has a lot of issues on a lot of emulators."
- **Level Theme and Concept Development:** Significant time is dedicated to brainstorming and finalizing themes for new courses, particularly Course 14 (Craft Materials) and Course 15 (Space Arcade), ensuring they are unique, fit the late-game difficulty, and are engaging.
- **Art Style Realization:** Kaze struggles to achieve the specific "gloomy," "surreal" art style envisioned for Course 13 (Ice Castle), iterating through textures, shaders, fog, and lighting. "The feeling of this place is not right for me. I don't like this. This is not what I envisioned this to be like."
- **Difficulty Pacing and Level Order:** Kaze is consciously planning the level order and difficulty curve to ensure a smooth player experience and proper introduction of mechanics.
- **Boss Design:** For Course 13, the boss (potentially Raphael the Raven) is considered integral to the level's theme and cinematic feel.
- **Technical Limitations:** While pushing visual boundaries, Kaze is mindful of N64 performance, e.g., analyzing the millisecond cost of rendering layers.
- **Avoiding Conventions (selectively):** For the final course (Course 15), Kaze wants to "alter some convention that all the other 30 levels follow," while being cautious about breaking established player expectations like "a retro-pipe in every level."

## Business Aspects
- **Minor Streamer Sponsorships:** Kaze briefly mentions receiving products from "Gamersub" (Gamer Soup) and a pre-workout brand for testing, with the possibility of sponsorship. This appears related to his streaming activities rather than direct funding for the "Return to Yoshi's Island" project. No other specific funding, marketing, or release/distribution plans for the game itself are discussed in this transcript.

## Key Quotes
- "Project 64 inaccuracies, unfortunately. Right now the game has a lot of issues on a lot of emulators. There isn't much I can do about it. Hopefully it just fixes itself magically like usual." (Highlighting a core development frustration)
- "Course 15 needs to be a banger... We want this to be kinda special. We want it to be something that allows for difficulty as well. It should alter some convention that all the other 30 levels follow." (Stating the ambition for the final levels)
- "The feeling of this place is not right for me. I don't like this. This is not what I envisioned this to be like." (Kaze on the art style struggles for Course 13, showcasing the iterative process)
- "I think I can only appreciate boss fights as a set piece. So for me, the number one priority when we make a boss is to make sure it's a cool set piece." (Revealing his philosophy on boss design)

## Potential Interview Topics
- **The "Return to Yoshi's Island" Vision:** Explore the core inspirations (especially Yoshi's Island) and how Kaze aims to translate that into a Mario 64 experience. Discuss the decision to reorder levels and manage the difficulty curve.
- **Navigating Technical Hurdles:** Delve into the challenges of ROM hacking on the N64 decompilation, particularly the persistent emulator compatibility issues and how they impact design and testing.
- **Collaborative Creativity:** Discuss the working dynamics with Biobak (graphics/concepts) and Zeina (art), how their contributions shape the game, and the role of community feedback in the design process (e.g., the genesis of the "Craft Materials" level).
- **Level Design Philosophy:** Further explore Kaze's approach to creating "vibes," his aversion to puzzles in this game, and his focus on platforming and cinematic boss encounters.
- **The Art of the "Final Level":** Unpack the specific goals and pressures Kaze feels for designing Course 15 as a "banger" that breaks conventions, and the brainstorming process that led to the Space Arcade and Craft Materials themes.
