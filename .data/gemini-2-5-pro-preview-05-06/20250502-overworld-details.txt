## Game Development Process
- Currently focusing on finishing shaders and base visuals for overworld sections, including corals, rocks, volcano, and cave areas.
- A level is being prepared for beta testing; Course 4 is being polished for this purpose (beta test described as sending ROM to one person).
- Core game design (level layout, "mapped out the board") was established earlier; current phase involves fleshing out these areas with visual details and specific ideas.
- Iterative work on textures and "combiners" (N64 shaders) to achieve desired N64 aesthetics.
- Addressing and fixing visual bugs as they arise (e.g., issues with decals, missing footprints).
- The project is limited to a 64-megabyte ROM size.
- Development involves reusing existing level elements and creating new assets like plants and flowers for specific areas like "Bunny Burrow."

## Personal Insights
- Kaze Emanuar expresses a desire for the overworld to feel "placey" (immersive and like a real location) rather than "gamey."
- He is candid about his own skills, feeling he has "no talent for art" but has improved, and considers himself a skilled programmer ("top 2% or 3%") though perhaps lacking in formal, broad knowledge.
- He holds strong opinions on the quality of the original Mario 64 C code (believing it to be "below average," with some exceptions like Goddard's work).
- Kaze enjoys the challenge of optimization and laments when it's overlooked, though he understands the modern game development trade-offs.
- He reflects on the commercialization of his YouTube channel as a necessity to fund his time and resources (like video editing) for projects.
- He mentions being significantly more productive on the game before having a full-time job and other responsibilities.

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub (composer):** Not explicitly mentioned as the composer for "Return to Yoshi's Island" in this transcript, though Kaze discusses the RTYI OST and the idea of potentially selling it, implying its existence.
- **Biobak (graphics artist, referred to as Biobank/Bioware in transcript):** Tasked with reworking and refining Kaze's initial visual work, particularly shaders and art assets, to achieve a higher level of polish. Kaze mentions Biobak will "rework some of this anyway" and "make this look really good in the end."
- **Zeina (animations):** Kaze asks Zeina about progress on a "skip button" for cutscenes, indicating Zeina's involvement in implementing specific gameplay-related animation or UI features.
- **Other Contributors:**
    - **Akumoid:** Collaborated with Kaze on a reflective metallic shader used in another level, which Kaze considers using for the lighthouse in RTYI.
    - **Community (Fast64 Plugin):** The Blender plugin (Fast64) Kaze uses is primarily community-written.
    - **Fnatic:** Provided Kaze with a specific (private) version of an emulator.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Overworld Philosophy:** Prioritizing an immersive, "placey" feel over a "gamey" one, influencing decisions like not having Banjo-Kazooie style level nameplates.
- **NPC Interaction:** Designing interactive NPCs like Pachyderm (from Yoshi's Story) who blocks an entrance and can be bypassed either by paying coins or by ground-pounding, offering player choice.
- **Visuals and Aesthetics:** Significant time spent on selecting/creating textures, designing shaders (combiners) for N64, and iterating on visuals for various environmental elements (corals, volcano, caves, plants). Challenges include making textures look good despite N64 limitations ("This texture kind of looks like shit," "The edges, man").
- **Cutscene Experience:** Implementing a cutscene skip functionality (holding 'A' button to fill a circle) for player convenience.
- **Technical Constraints:** Constantly working within N64 hardware limitations (combiner complexity, texture memory, ROM size) is a major recurring challenge that shapes design and implementation.
- **Bug Fixing:** Dealing with engine bugs (e.g., clipping into slanted walls, a Mario 64 engine bug) and tool-related issues (e.g., Fast64 plugin exporting textures incorrectly).
- **Atmosphere:** Making areas like the "Bunny Burrow" entrance feel "friendly and inviting" to contrast with obstacles like Pachyderm.

## Business Aspects
- Kaze's YouTube channel is monetized through sponsors found via an agency, which helps pay for video editing and supports his ability to work on projects like RTYI. He acknowledges this has "commercialized" his channel.
- He briefly mentions the idea of buying samples for the Mario 64 OST if he were to "sell the RTYI OST," indicating a consideration, however speculative, of monetizing game assets.
- He openly discusses the ethics and reception of taking a gambling sponsorship on YouTube, weighing the financial benefits.
- No direct funding model for RTYI itself (like crowdfunding for the game directly) is detailed in this transcript, beyond the YouTube income supporting his time.

## Key Quotes
- "That makes the overworld feel very gamey and I want this to feel placey." - Kaze on his design philosophy for the overworld.
- "Our goal here is to throw together some shaders that work well, and put some ideas into here. So if it's not perfect for now, that is fine... So that Biobank can actually make this look really good in the end." - Kaze on the iterative development process and collaboration with Biobak.
- "skill-wise, I'm at least a top 2% or 3% programmer. Knowledge-wise, probably not. And I would say that, maybe I'm being an asshole here, but I would say that the code I've seen in Mario 64 is below average, unfortunately." - Kaze's reflection on his skills and the original game's code.

## Potential Interview Topics
- Exploration of the initial "mapping out the board" phase of RTYI's design and how that blueprint guides current development.
- Deeper dive into the collaborative workflow with Biobak, Zeina, and other contributors: communication, creative freedom, and how their input shapes the final game.
- Specific examples of overcoming N64 technical limitations to achieve a desired visual or gameplay effect in RTYI.
- Kaze's philosophy on what makes a good ROM hack, and how he balances innovation with faithfulness to the source material (Yoshi's Island and Mario 64).
- Discussion of the "annual carrot festival" and other lore elements designed to make the world of RTYI feel alive and inviting.
