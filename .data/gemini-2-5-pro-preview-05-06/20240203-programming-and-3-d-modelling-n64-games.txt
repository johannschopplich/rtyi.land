## Game Development Process
-   The game is in a significant development phase, focusing on overhauling core mechanics, notably a complete rewrite of Mario's collision system and implementation of a new "step function" for movement.
-   Kaze mentions being in "course 12" and having "like three and a half levels left, basically," indicating substantial progress in level creation.
-   Specific missions, like the "minecart mission," are being finalized and showcased, though new systems are still introducing bugs (e.g., a crash during the minecart mission demo due to the new collision functions).
-   Development is iterative, with new systems being actively worked on, tested, and refined live on stream (e.g., the collision system was started "yesterday").
-   Work includes asset integration and refinement, such as setting up a bulletin board with textures made by Zeyna and designing NPC appearances.

## Personal Insights
-   Kaze believes Mario 64's movement design is "awesome," but the level design often lacks "placeness" (a distinct theme or vibe), which he aims to improve in "Return to Yoshi's Island."
-   He reflects on past projects, like "SM64 Madness," noting community perception about its "soul" despite its rapid development (two weeks).
-   Kaze values creating levels with a strong identity and theme, stating, "I think for places it's very important that the level has like a theme. A vibe. Something that you can identify the level with."
-   He expresses a desire for the new collision system to be "much better than any other Mario 64 thing."
-   He has a pragmatic approach to using existing assets if suitable: "we might as well just take assets from Google who cares... it'd hypocritical for us to like hack roms and then pretend like it's completely wrong to take assets."

## Collaborator Information
-   **Badub:**
    -   Mentioned as "making a lot of music" for the project.
    -   Kaze defers questions about music releases to Baduk ("you have to ask the dupe whenever he feels like it").
-   **Biobak:**
    -   Credited with "making a lot of stuff" for the hack, implying significant graphical or asset contributions.
-   **Zeina:**
    -   A key collaborator, physically present (upstairs in the same house during the stream).
    -   Contributes animations (e.g., the new spin jump animation, which Kaze then "polished").
    -   Creates textures and art assets (e.g., drawings for the bulletin board, textures for it, potentially designs for Koopa accessories like glasses and a cane).
    -   Engages in direct, often humorous, back-and-forth with Kaze during the stream regarding assets and game elements.
-   **Other Contributors:**
    -   **CDI and Zelda:** Mentioned as having provided help for Kaze's previous project, "Zelda Missing Link" ("I did have help from CDI and Zelda, which really helped the project."). It's not explicitly stated they are contributing to "Return to Yoshi's Island," but they are past collaborators.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
-   **Collision System Overhaul:** A major undertaking to "rewrite Mario's collision entirely" for a more robust and improved feel. The new system uses binary searches, raycasts, and move verifications. Current challenges include bugs like incorrect animations on rollout and non-functional ceiling bonks.
-   **Spin Jump Animation:** The decision to use Mario's Down-B animation from Smash Melee for the spin jump, as the original "twirl looked bad" and the Melee version felt like the "closest you have to an official version... from 1996."
-   **Level Entrance Design (Monty Mole Boss):** Iterative design process for accessing a new area. Initial idea of a simple hole was dismissed. Explored options like a fake cardboard cutout boulder before settling on a breakable rock, potentially requiring a "bomb cap." The challenge is to make it discoverable but not overly obvious.
-   **NPC Design (Koopa Bankier):** Detailed discussion on creating a "Wild West bank employee" Koopa, including considerations for its appearance (baldness as a "vibe," beard style, glasses, clothing).
-   **Rendering and Technical Art:** Challenges with default material settings causing rendering issues ("Dude, I hate that this defaults to environment... it actually will render wrong"). Implementing "fog-shaded decals" and dealing with "coordinate quantization" for poster rendering.
-   **Dynamic Text Boxes:** A new feature where text boxes automatically resize to fit the dialogue content, showcased as a quality-of-life improvement.
-   **Yoshi Coins:** Replacing 100-coin stars, indicating a change in collectible philosophy.

## Business Aspects
-   Kaze acknowledges a "free dollar donation" from a viewer, suggesting informal monetary support via streaming.
-   He mentions that a video about the new complex collision system wouldn't be "marketable," indicating some awareness of content appeal, but this doesn't seem to drive core development decisions for the game itself.
-   No formal marketing, structured funding, or specific release/distribution plans were discussed.

## Key Quotes
-   "So, I had an idea yesterday to just rewrite Mario's collision entirely. What you're seeing right now is the rewritten collision... Once my new collision system is done, dude, this game will be so nice collision-wise, I think. Much better than any other Mario 64 thing."
-   "Yeah, I don't think Mario 64 is that great either, except for the movement design. Like the level design itself is not great, but the movement is like awesome. So that's the part I want to change."
-   "I think for places it's very important that the level has like a theme. A vibe. Something that you can identify the level with."
-   "We have like three and a half levels left, basically. We're in course 12 here."

## Potential Interview Topics
-   **The Philosophy Behind Rewriting Core SM64 Systems:** Explore Kaze's motivations for overhauling fundamental elements like collision, the specific shortcomings he aimed to address, and the technical innovations in his new system.
-   **Achieving "Placeness" in Level Design:** Delve deeper into his concept of "placeness." How does this philosophy guide level creation in "Return to Yoshi's Island," and how does he differentiate his approach from the original Mario 64 levels?
-   **The Collaborative Dynamic with Key Contributors (Zeyna, Baduk, Biobak):** Discuss how the creative process works with his team. How are tasks distributed, feedback exchanged, and a cohesive vision maintained, especially with Zeyna being in close proximity?
-   **Balancing Homage and Innovation:** How does Kaze decide which elements of Mario 64 to preserve, enhance, or completely reinvent for "Return to Yoshi's Island"? What's his approach to player expectations for a "Mario 64" experience?
-   **The Journey of a Prolific ROM Hacker:** Kaze's reflections on his evolution as a game creator, from earlier projects like "SM64 Madness" to the ambitions of "Return to Yoshi's Island," and how his design principles have developed.
