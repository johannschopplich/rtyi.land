## Game Development Process
- **Current Focus: Overworld Development:** Kaze is heavily focused on creating and refining the overworld for "Return to Yoshi's Island." He describes it as a "very difficult overworld to make" because it "is going to bring everything together."
- **Major Milestone Achieved: 360-Degree Island:** "The island is now complete. 360 degrees. You can go everywhere on this island." This foundational structure is in place, and the current work involves populating and refining it.
- **Modular Development:** He refers to working on specific parts of the overworld, such as "part 13," and mentions "part 14 and 15 left, which is above in the sky." This indicates a structured approach to building the game world.
- **Iterative Refinement:** After establishing the basic structure ("The concept works"), the next step is to "make it good now," suggesting a phase of iteration and polish.
- **Technical Aspects:** Mentions that the game has no memory leaks ("Memory leak is impossible because I don't use allocs") but "Buffer overflows definitely exist," though potentially hard to trigger. The game runs at "240p" on real hardware.

## Personal Insights
- **Motivation for Creation:** "Fun is not really something I think about when I make stuff." This suggests his drive comes from the act of creation, problem-solving, or achieving a vision, rather than continuous enjoyment of the process itself.
- **Self-Perception as a Developer:** "Contrary to popular belief, I am not educated on programming. I am just a crazy man with a hacks editor." He downplays formal programming knowledge, emphasizing an intuitive or tool-assisted approach.
- **Evolving Public Image:** "Back then I was just like a dude making Mario hacks and now people know me as the optimization guy. But I'm still just a dude making Mario hacks to be honest." He acknowledges a shift in how the community views him but remains grounded in his core identity.
- **Opinion on PC Ports:** He is critical of the widely known SM64 PC port ("I think it's garbage... It was made to be garbage"), strongly preferring and advocating for "static recompilation" (e.g., by Wiseguy) as a technically superior and mod-friendly alternative.
- **Future Aspirations:** "I definitely want to make commercial video games at some point. I think I have to move to that eventually. So hopefully then I'll move to PC development."

- Zeina: No relevant information found in this transcript.
- **Other Contributors:**
    - **Daryl and Isa:** Mentioned as collaborators on Kaze's past popular project, "R64 Chaos Edition." ("Daryl and Isa, they worked together to put me in my R64, and they called this chaos edition").
    - **PixelPallava:** Suggested a game mechanic idea for "Return to Yoshi's Island." ("So one idea that PixelPallava had earlier today was that maybe there should be a shop to buy a magnet that will suck in coins..."). Kaze seemed to dismiss this particular idea.
    - **Wiseguy:** Developer of a "static recompilation" tool for N64 games. Kaze speaks highly of him and his work ("This is made by a very competent person, Wiseguy... Wiseguy said that maybe he can port my mod to it once it's done. Which would be really, really cool.")
    - **Unnamed individual:** "The guy that did the measurements for whether the N64 runs faster at certain temperatures."

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Overworld Centrality and Complexity:** The overworld is a critical, complex component. "This overworld is going to bring everything together. So this is going to be a very difficult overworld to make."
- **Scope Management:** "Now, there's actually a lot of ideas we have for this overworld, and it's actually so many that we cannot possibly fit all of them in."
- **Transformative Secret Stars:** A core design principle for overworld secrets is that they should impact the game world. "I want every star in the overworld to kind of transform the overworld in a way."
    - **Example - Rain Flower Star:** A detailed concept was workshopped: A sad blue sunflower causes rain. Helping nearby Yoshis (by paying Bowser's Builders to rebuild their houses) makes the flower happy, it turns yellow, the rain stops, and a star appears.
- **Player Guidance and Discovery:** The overworld is designed to naturally guide players and pique their curiosity about distant, initially inaccessible areas. "There's always like one thing, then you're like, oh my god, I wonder what that is, I need to go there."
- **NPC Backstory/Lore:** Bowser's Builders are characterized as having "decided to desert" Bowser after "OSHA violations in Koopa Carnival" and even attempted to unionize.
- **Overworld Map Feature:** "There's going to be a map in the overworld that has like the entire thing. And it's gonna look kinda like this, and it's gonna unroll when you open the pause menu."
- **Tools:** Kaze mentions using "ROM Manager since 2018" and notes that "Toadstool is from the 2017 era. It's been outdated since then... There's also Quad64, which replaces Toadstool."

## Business Aspects
- **YouTube Sponsorship:** "I'm going to spend so much time in the next few weeks making videos because I have a Squarespace sponsorship, and they need me to make six videos in three months, but they pay really well, and I need money." This directly funds his work/living.
- **Future Commercial Ambitions:** "I definitely want to make commercial video games at some point. I think I have to move to that eventually."
- **Distribution Considerations (Indirect):** His strong preference for the "static recompilation" PC port method and willingness to have his mod ported ("if people ask me to put my mod on the static recompilation, I would be much more open to that") suggests consideration for broader accessibility for his work, though not direct sales of the ROM hack.

## Key Quotes
- "The island is now complete. 360 degrees. You can go everywhere on this island... We just need to make it good now. But the concept works." (Milestone and development philosophy)
- "Contrary to popular belief, I am not educated on programming. I am just a crazy man with a hacks editor." (Self-perception and approach)
- "In part 13 there is a blue sun flower. She's sad and that's causing rain to happen all around her... You can cure their sadness by paying Bowser's Builders to rebuild the houses... she turns yellow, spawns a star, and the rain stops." (Example of integrated game design)

## Potential Interview Topics
- **The Vision for "Return to Yoshi's Island":** Beyond being "Yoshi's Island" in 3D, what are the core experiential goals? What specific elements or feelings from the original is he trying to capture or evolve?
- **Overworld Design Philosophy:** Explore the journey of designing the 360-degree interconnected overworld. What were the biggest challenges and "aha!" moments in making it feel cohesive and encourage exploration? How does he decide which of the "so many ideas" make the cut?
- **The "Rain Flower" Star as a Case Study:** Delve deeper into the design process for this specific star. How does this exemplify his approach to making secrets meaningful and transformative for the game world?
- **Collaboration and Community:** Since specific key collaborators for RTMI weren't mentioned here, ask about their roles if they are involved (Badub, Biobak, Zeina). How does he generally approach collaboration and incorporate community feedback or ideas into his projects?
- **The Future of Kaze Emanuar's Mods and Game Development:** Discuss his strong opinions on PC porting (static recompilation). What would an ideal PC version of "Return to Yoshi's Island" look like, and how does this project fit into his longer-term ambitions for commercial game development?
