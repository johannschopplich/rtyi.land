## Game Development Process
- The game is in a relatively advanced stage, with a new demo planned for release around December 28th, contingent on the completion of several promotional videos.
- Kaze indicates he is "basically done with" the content for the demo.
- Current development focus includes fixing bugs (e.g., King Bob-omb effects, gear rotations, texture issues), implementing specific level mechanics (e.g., Bokwang spawning, wall switches), and refining existing elements.
- There's an ongoing effort to improve visual fidelity, with plans to add VFX and SFX while other collaborators (likely Biobak) complete reworks.
- Kaze mentions having most "actors" (game elements/entities) in place for certain areas, with minor exceptions like "the pipe at the end."
- A stage is being designed or reworked with the concept of being playable both forwards and backwards, offering different experiences.

## Personal Insights
- Kaze often works while listening to high-energy music like Frenchcore and Eurobeat, finding it enjoyable.
- He has a unique way of processing information, likening his short-term memory for numbers to an "ear buffer."
- He openly engages with his chat, including taking an autism test live on stream and reflecting on the results, stating, "I mean I'm obviously not neurotypical right I might just do something else that has some symptom overlap."
- He expresses a sense of dedication to optimizing and enhancing a "28 year old video game."
- Kaze exhibits a direct and sometimes blunt communication style, but also shows self-awareness and humor about his own behavior and the development process.

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub (composer):**
    - While Badub isn't directly named as working on something specific in this transcript, Kaze solicits "OST wishes for today" and critiques game music, indicating ongoing work or selection in this area. ("Fuck whoever composed this. I want something else.")
- **Biobak (graphics artist):**
    - Biobak is actively involved in providing graphical assets and reworks. Kaze directly addresses Biobak ("hello biomech") regarding missing textures in "factorycanon.blend."
    - Biobak is responsible for "the biomex rework of the stage."
    - Kaze consults Biobak on elements like a "bombable wall" and discusses Biobak's decision to remove "wall gears."
    - Kaze mentions waiting for Biobak ("my like") to finish reworks before he focuses on final visual polish like VFX/SFX.
- **Zeina (animations):**
    - Not directly mentioned as actively working during this stream. However, when discussing King Bob-omb, Kaze states, "Nope, he doesn't need any new animations, he's good as is," implying animation work is a considered aspect of development.
- **Other Contributors:**
    - **Curse15:** Mentioned as having collaborated on a previous stream related to game mechanics ("I did this stream before with curse15").
    - **Unnamed Editor:** Kaze mentions, "There's another video my editor has yet to start on," indicating an editor is involved in creating promotional videos for the game.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Conditional Spawning:** Implementing logic for "bokwang" not to spawn if the player has already acquired a specific cap.
- **Boss Mechanics (King Bob-omb):**
    - Restoring a lost visual effect where King Bob-omb's body would blink orange when hit.
    - Deciding against making him die in one hit to preserve the visual effect, then later reducing hits required.
    - Adjusting his explosion color.
- **Level Design:**
    - Designing a stage to be playable forwards and backwards, with obstacles working differently in each direction.
    - Adding a dynamic wall that appears when a switch is pressed.
    - Addressing missing elements like a "box in this room."
- **Texture and Visual Issues:**
    - "textures missing in the factorycanon.blend file"
    - "the multex just still messed up"
    - Improving the appearance of a bombable wall texture using advanced lighting techniques (grayscale textures, primitive colors for room lighting).
- **Bug Fixing:**
    - "the gears right now obviously have a huge bug with one of them rotating on the wrong axis"
    - "The modems spawn too high now"
    - Debugging why a certain game event ("this") activated too early.
- **Optimization:** Kaze mentions a "silly optimization" he did that made code harder to read for minimal gain.

## Business Aspects
- **Demo Release Strategy:** A new demo release is planned around December 28th, tied to a schedule of releasing promotional videos (one on "Saturday," one for "the missing link" on December 14th).
- **Monetization:** Kaze mentions being "so close to Twitter monetization" and humorously discusses the ease of getting views by announcing "I have Twitter blue."
- **Sponsorships:** Kaze jokingly discusses a "Manscaped sponsorship opportunity" received via email, indicating an awareness of potential sponsorship deals.

## Key Quotes
- "The new demo will be released whenever the video for it is ready at this point... which I guess might be December 28th or something." (Provides a timeline and links development to marketing efforts)
- "No I'm actually thinking what likely happens on this game is that I'll be done with most of it Before my like [collaborator, likely Biobak] is done with like the reworks... So likely what I'll do in that time is Improve the visual fidelity of things hopefully So I'll be adding VFX SFX stuff like that" (Highlights development strategy, collaboration, and focus on polish)
- "Okay, this is one of the stages that has like one very expendable thing going on and that is the idea that You have to be the server once forwards and once backwards and I did beat it backwards earlier and I think it's really fun To beat this stage backwards as well Because like all the obstacles may kind of work for you that way And it changes the vibe a lot." (Showcases an innovative game design choice)
