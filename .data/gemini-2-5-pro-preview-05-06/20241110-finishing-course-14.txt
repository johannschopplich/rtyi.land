## Game Development Process
- Kaze is nearing completion of "Course 14" (Handmade Heights/Cardboard Castle theme), with final tasks including star naming, implementing a Yoshi coin reward from Peach, and awaiting one final asset from collaborator Yuki (Zeina).
- He has begun the planning and conceptualization phase for "Course 15," an "Astral Arcade" themed level set in space, including brainstorming level mechanics, star ideas, and integrating music.
- ROM size management is an ongoing consideration, with the current build around 58-62MB, well within his self-imposed 64MB limit.
- The development process involves asset creation/refinement (e.g., Peach cutout), scripting (NPC interactions, star logic), bug fixing (e.g., star spawning loops), and high-level design.
- There's a clear iterative cycle of development, often showcased live on stream, including real-time problem-solving and design adjustments.

## Personal Insights
- Kaze values his creative freedom and independence, particularly his ability to mod games, which influences his perspective on potentially working for larger companies like Nintendo.
- He makes pragmatic technical decisions, such as using the N64 Expansion Pak RAM to simplify and speed up development, while still adhering to certain self-imposed "authentic" limitations like the 64MB ROM size.
- He has strong opinions on game design, aiming to create "fun" and engaging experiences, and is critical of mechanics or minigames that he feels detract from the core 3D platforming gameplay.
- Kaze is transparent about his development process and thoughts, often "thinking aloud" on stream and engaging with his community, though he filters feedback based on practicality.
- He reflects on the games industry, particularly Nintendo's policies regarding streaming and IP, expressing a desire for outcomes that benefit the broader gaming and streaming community.

## Collaborator Information
- **Badoob:** The primary composer for the project. Kaze mentions receiving and integrating Badoob's music for Course 15 ("Funky Space Casino"). Badoob's music often inspires Kaze's level design and vibe.
- **Biobak:** No relevant information found in this transcript.
- **Zeina (referred to as Yuki):** Responsible for animations and specific art assets. Kaze mentions waiting for an asset from Yuki for Peach to complete Course 14. Yuki is also slated to animate Peach.
- **Other Contributors:**
    - **Laira:** Mentioned as the creator of an "adorable peach drawing" seen or discussed on stream.
    - **Holly:** A stream viewer who actively assisted Kaze in real-time with a technical music task (finding the loop point for Badoob's Course 15 track).
    - **Eiza:** A past collaborator. Assets from a previous project ("Gadabox slide") made with Eiza are being reused in "Return to Yoshi's Island" (e.g., UFO, satellites for Course 15).

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Course 14 (Handmade Heights/Cardboard Castle):** Star names and concepts were finalized, including "Cardboard Castle Climb," "Doodle for Luigi," "Zip through the Zipper," "Blast the Bullseyes," "Mummy's Maroon Money," and "Retro Pipe Painting." A mechanic where Peach gives a Yoshi coin after being rescued from "thimble guys" (Shy Guys) was implemented. A Bowser boss fight is planned for this level.
- **Course 15 (Astral Arcade):**
    - Theme: A giant space arcade, potentially built on top of Rainbow Road, serving as the game's "version of Rainbow Road."
    - Key Ideas:
        - Using an exploding moon minigame (Star Fox 64 style) that affects the main 3D level layout.
        - Incorporating pinball machine elements (bumpers, flippers) as 3D platforming obstacles rather than a playable pinball game.
        - Utilizing low-gravity sections and black holes for level transitions and to expand the playable area.
        - A central rocket structure for a platforming gauntlet.
        - Including a Whack-a-Mole game and potentially a Skee-Ball style game for a Yoshi coin.
    - Rejected Ideas: Simple slot machine stars, "out-of-yourself" control games, and other minigames that Kaze felt were "weak" or didn't fit the 3D platforming style.
- **General Challenges:**
    - Bug fixing: Addressed issues like a star spawning in a permanent loop (due to a "listhead" not being set) and refining NPC interactions.
    - Asset Integration: Ensuring music loops correctly.
    - Player Experience: Avoiding player confusion and ensuring mechanics are fun and intuitive (e.g., "Imagine if that area didn't have a star you would just be very confused and we wanna avoid that.").
    - Avoiding Forced Minigames: A strong desire to not replicate experiences like in "Wario Land 4" where players are forced into disparate minigames for progression.

## Business Aspects
- Kaze mentions he is close to getting monetized on Twitter, indicating an exploration of additional revenue streams.
- He creates YouTube content (like a video on N64 RAM, and his development streams) that supports his work and engages his community, viewing some videos as potential "bangers" that will do well.
- He mentions a demo release for a different project ("Barney Rushford") being tied to the release of prerequisite YouTube videos, suggesting a content-driven release strategy.
- No direct funding or specific commercial release plans for "Return to Yoshi's Island" are mentioned in this transcript; it appears to be a passion project supported by his broader content creation.

## Key Quotes
- "No, but I Want to stick to the 64 megabyte limit because that's what they worked with back in a day. So I'm going over that would feel like cheating. It's also kind of nice to have some real limits because otherwise it's like Otherwise I feel like I can just like keep adding more and more and I do want to be done eventually." - Kaze on self-imposed limitations.
- "I don't want this game to turn into W64 where it's like, oh you like 3D platformers? Fuck you. Here's Pac-Man. Go beat Pac-Man. Fucking idiot. You know what I mean." - Kaze on his design philosophy for integrating minigames.
- "I love working with a song already made for the level because it gives me so many ideas for the vibe." - Kaze on the influence of music in his creative process.

## Potential Interview Topics
