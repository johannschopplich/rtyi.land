## Game Development Process
- Currently focusing on specific level elements, particularly in one room, involving the implementation and refinement of "Whomp" enemy mechanics and interactions.
- A significant milestone being worked towards is the completion of the first star in the current level, which involves setting up five "troll" objectives for the player.
- The project has reached a stage where ROM size optimization is a critical ongoing task, involving removing unused assets (like SM64 backgrounds) and compressing sound samples.
- Regular testing on N64 hardware is part of the process, including live debugging of hardware-specific crashes (e.g., a floating point exception related to background color tables).
- Development involves iterative design of gameplay mechanics, level layout adjustments (e.g., shortening or removing sections for flow and performance), and integrating assets from collaborators.

## Personal Insights
- Kaze expresses genuine enthusiasm for visual improvements, such as new shadow effects ("Did I really love how the shadows look it looks so cool").
- He holds a strong design philosophy emphasizing organic player discovery over explicit hand-holding ("It's like admitting oh, I can't make a good game. Let me just make sure the player knows how it works anyway...it's like the principle of show. Don't tell").
- Kaze displays confidence in his technical understanding of the N64 ("I definitely know a lot more about the n64 to Nintendo ever did").
- He reflects on how past professional game development experience has influenced his coding habits, sometimes in ways he finds amusingly overly cautious in the context of ROM hacking ("Working in professional game development fucked up my brain. Checking for a null pointer.").
- He values creating "cool platforming" and fun interactions over purely chasing difficulty.

## Collaborator Information
- Badub (Composer):
    - Is actively working on music for the game again after a hiatus.
    - Currently composing a song specifically for the level Kaze is working on.
    - Kaze notes Badub is "really putting in the effort," which is beneficial for the project.
    - Kaze: "Dude but dude [Badub] finally wrote me again today. He's back and he's making music again. He said he was looking into a song for this level...But he's really putting in the effort, which is really really good for us."
- Biobak (Graphics Artist):
    - No direct mention of "Biobak" by name in this transcript. Modeling and art contributions are attributed to "Albie" (see Other Contributors).
- Zeina (Animations):
    - Is working on animations for characters/enemies, including render range issues and potentially Whomp animations.
    - Kaze mentions: "render near at the extra pump Zena's working on it right now".
    - Kaze also discusses animation needs with someone who seems to be providing them, likely Zeina or Albie (e.g., requesting Whomp idle and tipping animations).
- Other Contributors:
    - **Albie:**
        - Provides models and animations. During the stream, Albie sent over Whomp idle and falling animations ("Alright, there you go one is idle two is falling over forwards Okay.").
        - Also modeled the "banana cat" meme object.
        - Kaze interacts directly with Albie via chat for asset delivery and feedback.
    - **KakitaDev:**
        - Mentioned in the context of Kaze optimizing some of KakitaDev's code for better N64 performance. This seems to be a friendly jab at another community developer.
        - Kaze: "KhakiDev is just salty that I changed his code to be a bit faster on the N64. His saltiest code wasn't optimized."
    - **Leela:**
        - Mentioned briefly at the start and later in a more interactive context ("Lila says to add the talking animation"). Seems to be someone present with Kaze during the stream, offering minor input.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Whomp Mechanics:** A significant portion of the stream is dedicated to deciding the Whomps' purpose and behavior. The idea evolves from them carrying beams to being building materials for a "Whomp tower" that players can knock over. This includes designing their animations, dialogue (being rude to Mario), and VFX for their collapse.
    - Challenge: Defining a fun and engaging role for the Whomps.
    - Solution: Iterative brainstorming leading to the Whomp tower concept, with community input.
- **Player Guidance for Multi-Part Objective:** A key challenge is guiding the player to interact with five specific "troll" NPCs/scenarios to earn a star, without resorting to obvious markers like exclamation points.
    - Challenge: Ensuring players discover all necessary interactions without explicit instructions.
    - Solution: Implementing multiple subtle layers of hints (e.g., NPC dialogue from a Wiggler, consistent Bowser helmets on target NPCs, NPCs being rude to invite interaction, environmental clues). Kaze: "I want as many hints as possible as many layers of you know safety as possible But I want not a single hint to be like overbearing."
- **Level Design and Pacing:** Kaze re-evaluates a platforming section, deeming it "meaningless" and a "prime candidate for just cutting it" to improve level flow and address performance concerns.
    - Challenge: Redundant or poorly performing level sections.
    - Solution: Willingness to cut or significantly alter existing level geometry.
- **N64 Hardware Limitations:** A recurring challenge is working within the N64's constraints, leading to N64-only crashes that need debugging and a constant focus on ROM size and performance optimization.
    - Challenge: Technical issues on target hardware.
    - Solution: Live debugging, code optimization, and careful asset management.
- **NPC Dialogue and Character:** Decisions are made about NPC dialogue to make them rude to Mario, thereby incentivizing the player to "mess with them." Text is refined to be concise yet characterful.
    - Challenge: Making NPC interactions meaningful and motivating.
    - Solution: Crafting dialogue that provides hints and personality, often with community input.

## Business Aspects
- **Potential Release Timing:** Kaze mentions a tentative release plan: "I'm planning to release it on the 30th. Which I think is like the deadline for someone's competition or something." This indicates a possible soft deadline or target tied to an external event.
- **Hardware Compatibility:** A strong emphasis is placed on ensuring the game runs correctly on actual N64 hardware, which is crucial for the ROM hack's target audience and distribution.
- No direct mentions of funding, specific marketing strategies beyond streaming, or sales plans were found in this transcript.

## Key Quotes
- "I actually Started optimizing the game for ROM size because we're at a point where we have to optimize the game for ROM size So I removed all the Mario 64 backgrounds." (Highlights a development phase and technical consideration)
- "The one thing I'm not sure about it's like what do the womps even do... So They're building something here they're like building a tower and there's just gonna be a tower made out of lumps I Like that... Now that's really cool that is such a funny idea." (Shows the iterative design process and joy in creative solutions)
- "The problem is how do you know to do all the five of them? ... I Mean, I want as many hints as possible as many layers of you know safety as possible But I want not a single hint to be like overbearing." (Articulates a core game design challenge regarding player guidance)

## Potential Interview Topics
