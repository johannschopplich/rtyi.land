## Game Development Process
- **Current Focus:** Actively working on a "cowboy bar" / "milk bar" saloon level, including layout, NPC dialogue ("Howdy partner..."), and secret rooms ("chalky milk room").
- **Mechanics Development:** Refining Dry Bones enemy behavior, making them stronger (immune to jumps, requiring ground pounds) with a lore justification (milk consumption).
- **Level Design & Iteration:**
    - Planning future course themes (Courses 13, 14, 15), with a "space station" idea being favored.
    - Reworking existing content: Course 2 ("Divine Dino Domain") is being changed to include more platforming, replacing a "lame as fuck" water raft section.
    - Considering overall game structure: Discussing themes for side levels (mushroom forest, arctic toy train level).
- **Technical Exploration:** Considering a new N64 tech for decompressing songs at runtime, potentially for a full OST on cartridge.
- **Asset Integration:** Importing textures (e.g., from XPM), working on level geometry in Blender, and integrating them into the game.
- **Story Development:** Mentions a need to "overhaul the story of this game a little bit too," noting "The whole slavery plot is a little bit dark for a Mario game."

## Personal Insights
- **Creative Philosophy:** "What would be the point of an existence where you don't create? That's like the whole purpose of the human soul."
- **N64 Limitations as a Creative Constraint:** "I'm not interested in ever using more than 8MB just because the original N64 games didn't do it. And going beyond the original limitations is just kinda against the spirit of the challenge."
- **Inspiration Sources:** Level themes for "Lost Impact" came from dreams, and he suggests a similar approach for RTYI: "We should just go with crazy themes or just like random things that come to me in my dreams."
- **Views on Modding Ethics:** Believes if you hack a game without consent, you should accept others hacking your hack without your consent.
- **Utilitarian View of AI:** Sees AI (like ChatGPT) as a "very good tool" and "a better google" for tasks like code generation or information retrieval, while acknowledging its limitations.
- **Dismissal of Established Theories:** Expresses skepticism towards conventional color theory ("it's so arbitrary who decided that the color wheel was like the colors that go well together") and music theory ("Why the fuck is it 12 notes").

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub (Banduke):** Composer. Kaze praises his music ("Everything Banduke makes a banger, true"). Plans to pay him for the RTYI OST if the physical cartridge release happens.
- **Biobak:** Graphics artist. Kaze mentions using Biobak's "window technique" and considers his "combiner" for textures, though sometimes opts for different solutions based on specific needs.
- **Zeina:** Animator/General Contributor. Actively participates in chat. Kaze confirms Zeina is working on Dry Bones animations ("Skel sounds good").
- **Other Contributors:**
    - **XPM:** Texture artist whose textures are being used extensively in the saloon level.
    - **Khaki Dev:** A fellow modder whose code Kaze has interacted with.
    - **Sylar:** Mentioned as working on a "new function."
    - **Cozys:** Creators of the "MiniOMG property exporter" plugin.
    - **Pixel Empire:** The platform used for Kaze's merchandise.
    - **Lachlan:** A friend or associate Kaze mentions in relation to the milk bar.
    - An unnamed individual offered to make cactus models but did not follow through.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Saloon Level Design:**
    - **Concept:** A cowboy-themed milk bar with a secret "chalky milk" room for "bad guys" (Snifits, Shy Guy).
    - **Gameplay:** Players overhear conversations for clues, find a hidden doorknob to the secret room.
    - **Layout:** Detailed planning of bar section, tables, stage, secret room placement, and an upper level with a staircase.
    - **Aesthetics:** Concern about camera claustrophobia, adding swinging saloon doors, choice of floor and wall textures, lighting effects (additive blending for windows).
- **Enemy Mechanics (Dry Bones):**
    - **Challenge:** How to make Dry Bones in this area distinct and tougher.
    - **Solution:** They are immune to standard jumps due to "strong bones" from lifelong milk consumption (lore). This will be conveyed through NPC dialogue.
- **Level Theme Generation:**
    - **Challenge:** Finding "inspired" themes for later courses (13, 14, 15) and side levels, feeling some initial ideas were "uninspired."
    - **Approach:** Drawing inspiration from dreams or "cool shit," similar to "Lost Impact." Ideas considered include a music level, an oversized casino, a comic book city, a dream level (childhood experiences), and a space station (current preference).
- **Technical Constraints:** Adherence to N64 limitations (e.g., 8MB ROM size, managing polygon counts).
- **Dialogue:** Using ChatGPT as a tool to help generate cowboy-style dialogue for NPCs.
- **Reworking Content:** Decision to overhaul Course 2 to improve its platforming elements and remove a less engaging section.
- **Platforming Focus:** Acknowledges a lack of "cool platforming sections" and aims to add more, including reworking Course 2 to introduce "fling vines."

## Business Aspects
- **Physical OST Release:** "I'm thinking maybe it would be cool if we made a cartridge with all the RTYI songs and sold that separately... we're gonna sell it for like a hundred dollars or something with a box and like a custom cartridge and like an instruction booklet and stuff like that."
    - This is positioned as a "cool souvenir," with the digital ROM and soundtrack remaining free.
- **Merchandise:** Selling stickers (e.g., "skill issue," "Peach's Fury," "HA sticker," "Just program well") through Pixel Empire.
- **Funding/Paying Collaborators:** "I would like to pay a lot of artists that help with this game. I'm definitely gonna pay Barduke for the OST if we do end up making that cartridge."
- **Legal Considerations (Merch):** Briefly questions the legal responsibility for merch designs, relying on Pixel Empire's assurances.

## Key Quotes
- "I'm not interested in ever using more than 8MB just because the original N64 games didn't do it. And going beyond the original limitations is just kinda against the spirit of the challenge. At that point, why not just make a game for emulator?" - On development philosophy and N64 authenticity.
- "There's going to be a secret room where a bunch of bad guys sit around the table drinking chalky milk... We got caught chalky handed. Let's get out of boys or something like that." - On a specific, quirky design idea for the saloon.
- "Usually all the themes in Lost Impact were just things that literally came to me in a dream. That's probably why they feel so inspired to me. And I think we should use that approach for the level themes [in RTYI]." - On his source of inspiration for level design.

## Potential Interview Topics
- **The "Spirit of the Challenge":** Explore Kaze's decision to strictly adhere to N64 hardware limitations (like the 8MB ROM size) and how this constraint fuels or hinders creativity in "Return to Yoshi's Island."
- **Dream-Inspired Design:** Delve into the process of translating dream concepts and "cool shit" into tangible level designs and game mechanics, and how this compares to more conventional design approaches.
- **Collaboration Dynamics in ROM Hacking:** Discuss how Kaze works with contributors like Badub (music), Biobak (graphics), and Zeina (animation) in a distributed, often informal, ROM hacking environment. How are creative differences resolved, and how does their input shape the final game?
- **The "Chalky Milk" Philosophy:** Unpack the thought process behind unique and humorous game elements like the "chalky milk" secret room. How much of RTYI's design is driven by Kaze's personal sense of humor and desire to subvert player expectations?
- **From Hobby to Physical Product:** Investigate the motivations behind creating and selling physical merchandise (OST cartridge, stickers) for a free ROM hack. What does this signify about the project's evolution and Kaze's relationship with his audience?
- **Evolving Narrative:** Discuss the decision to overhaul the game's story, moving away from "the whole slavery plot," and explore the new narrative direction planned for RTYI and its intended tone.
