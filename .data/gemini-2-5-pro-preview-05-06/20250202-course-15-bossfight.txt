## Game Development Process
- The game, "Return to Yoshi's Island," is actively being developed, with a focus on creating complex boss fights and refining level details.
- There are 15 main courses planned, with approximately 9 of them featuring boss fights.
- Kaze is currently working on the boss for Course 15, a "Yoshi Pentapus." This involves designing its appearance (initially a "floating hat with some tumors," evolving into a tentacled creature), programming its attack patterns (tentacles from black holes, destroying "wards" or tumors), and implementing hitboxes and visual effects.
- Specific courses like Course 13 and Course 14 are described as "95% done," with Course 13 needing outside area work by Zeno and Course 14 awaiting more visuals from Violet.
- The development process is iterative, involving frequent testing, debugging, and refinement of mechanics and visuals (e.g., adjusting tentacle size, speed, lighting effects, collision).
- Kaze mentions a plan for "six side levels which would include the four cab levels but nowadays there's a good chance that it's actually going to be like nine side levels."

## Personal Insights
- Kaze Emanuar is highly opinionated about game design, valuing precision and polish, and expressing frustration with "jank" or bugs in games.
- He consciously maintains a politically neutral public persona to appeal to a broader audience, citing the "halo effect."
- He has a playful side, referencing past pranks like hiding large "cock" models in his old ROM hacks, visible only through hacking tools.
- Kaze values clear communication and expresses a desire for precision in language, which may reflect in his coding and design philosophy.
- He is candid about his development process, including mistakes and ongoing problem-solving, and interacts extensively with his chat, though he humorously dislikes repetitive questions like "how are you doing?"

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub (Badoop):** Implied to be the game's composer. Kaze refers to him as "royalty" and "famous" when a chatter mentions knowing about something potentially related to Badub's work (possibly music).
- **Biobak (Biowake):** A graphics artist responsible for remaking/refining 3D models. Kaze states, "The textures on the boss are not final, though. They're more like a symbolic representation of what I want this to look like, so that when Biowake remakes my model, he knows what I was going for."
- **Zeina:** No specific contribution to "Return to Yoshi's Island" animations is mentioned in this transcript. Kaze discusses his own past work implementing a rideable Yoshi in 2013.
- **Other Contributors:**
    - **Akumoid:** Collaborated with Kaze on creating advanced N64 shaders, specifically a reflection shader for buildings that Kaze is very pleased with. Akumoid was also working on shaders for a rocket model.
    - **Zeno:** Mentioned as working on the "outside area" for Course 13 for a long time.
    - **Violet:** Tasked with completing visuals for Course 14 to make it look "as pretty as it should be."

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Boss Design (Yoshi Pentapus):**
    - Concept: Evolved from a "Yoshi Kraken" to a "Yoshi Pentapus" (a five-tentacled creature) for uniqueness. The boss is a corrupted Yoshi that the player helps by destroying "tumors" or "wards."
    - Mechanics: Attacks with tentacles emerging from black/blue holes. Players must destroy "wards" on the tentacles, then attack exposed wards on Yoshi's nose to deal damage. The fight loop involves repeating this process.
    - Visuals: Placeholder model ("floating hat with tumors") used during development, with the final model to be done by Biobak/Biowake. Kaze is iterating on tentacle animations, black hole effects, and lighting cues for attacks.
- **Technical Challenges:**
    - Implementing tentacle hitboxes using "spline hitboxes."
    - Debugging rendering issues (e.g., texture problems, objects rotating incorrectly, material batching).
    - Creating effective visual cues for players (e.g., lights from portals to indicate attack origins).
    - Ensuring dynamic collision for tentacles works correctly and doesn't trap the player.
- **Easter Eggs:** Kaze plans to include "cryptographic messages" and other easter eggs that may require looking at the game's code to discover, adding a layer of mystery.
- **Level Structure:** 15 main courses, with 9 boss fights. Plans for 6-9 side levels.
- **Player Experience:** Kaze considers player fairness, such as making tentacles retract instantly upon hitting Mario to prevent getting stuck, even if it seems punishing. He also works on visual clarity for attack warnings.

## Business Aspects
- **Distribution/Accessibility:** Kaze mentions the possibility of using "YSK static recompilation to properly import the game to like everything at once. So you wouldn't even need an emulator." This suggests an interest in broader accessibility beyond traditional ROM hack emulation.
- **Community Ports:** Kaze expresses frustration with the quality of unofficial ports of his hacks to platforms like Co-op Deluxe, stating his general policy is to allow such ports if they don't require his help, but he gets annoyed if asked for assistance, especially if the porting effort is poor.
- No direct mentions of marketing budgets, sales, or traditional funding were found. The focus is on creation and potential accessibility.

## Key Quotes
- "So the boss is gonna be a Yoshi Kraken, but he doesn't look like a Kraken right now. He just looks like a floating hat with some tumors grown on it. And you destroy the tumors to beat him... Yes, this is the Yoshi. That's not a Kraken. It's a pentapose." (Illustrates creative evolution and core boss concept)
- "The loop is basically, Yoshi is like floating around here at the start... he starts attacking you... tentacles come and attack and the tentacles have these wards on them... you jump on his tentacle, you destroy the ward and then Yoshi gets weak... on his nose, there's more wards... you punch the ward and that's dealing damage to him. He shakes you off and then you repeat that three times." (Details a complex boss fight structure)
- "So the last few days, a person called Akumoid has been DMing with me. They wanted to learn about N64 shaders and they wanted to help me make a good shader for this. And together we came up with this one here... I'm very happy with this." (Highlights successful collaboration and technical innovation)

## Potential Interview Topics
- Explore the origin and core vision for "Return to Yoshi's Island." How does it connect to or depart from the original Yoshi's Island and SM64?
- Discuss Kaze's collaborative process in detail: How does he identify collaborators like Biobak, Akumoid, Zeno, and Violet? What is the workflow and creative dynamic when working with them on assets and levels?
- Delve into the design philosophy behind the complex boss fights, like the Yoshi Pentapus. What are the key elements he tries to incorporate to make them challenging yet fair and memorable?
- Kaze's perspective on pushing the N64 hardware to its limits through ROM hacking. What motivates him to undertake such ambitious technical challenges, like custom shaders and extensive new code?
- The future of ROM hack accessibility: Kaze's thoughts on YSK static recompilation and the potential for his projects to reach a wider audience beyond those familiar with emulators.
