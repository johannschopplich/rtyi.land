## Game Development Process
- Kaze is currently working on the overworld for "Return to Yoshi's Island," focusing on layout, adding key locations (Yoshi village, Bowser's drill site), and brainstorming ways to fill empty spaces.
- A major ongoing task has been a complete overhaul of the Mario 64 sound engine, which Kaze has been working on for 4-5 days non-stop, resulting in significant performance improvements, reduced code size, and bug fixes.
- The overworld layout is mostly complete, with current efforts focused on detailing and adding interactive elements.
- Kaze is actively brainstorming and planning numerous "single mechanic levels" – shorter side levels designed to reuse existing gameplay mechanics to efficiently increase the game's total star count (aiming for around 200 stars).
- Specific levels are being debugged and iterated upon, such as "Grins and Badland," which Kaze identifies as needing significant changes to improve player guidance.
- Progress is also tracked for levels being worked on by collaborators, like Marty's "Green Japanese Garden" and Zeno's work on "Forgotten Fortress."

## Personal Insights
- Kaze is highly self-critical of his work in progress, often stating that unfinished areas look like "absolute garbage" and managing expectations.
- He expresses a pragmatic and resilient attitude towards the possibility of a cease and desist, stating, "If it happens, it happens. It's not the end of the world. I can still just turn it into my own branded game, hopefully."
- He shares strong opinions on various topics, such as his dislike for the original Mario 64 sound engine ("It sucks") and websites like Reddit ("a website for losers").
- Kaze appears very busy and somewhat stressed by his workload, frequently mentioning having "so much stuff to do."
- He values efficiency in development, preferring to reuse existing mechanics for new content rather than creating entirely new complex systems for small side levels.

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub (Composer):** While Badub isn't mentioned by name in a work context, Kaze confirms the need for an original soundtrack: "OST? Yes, we need an OST." This suggests music is a planned component.
- **Biobak (Graphics Artist):** Kaze mentions, "We're limited on bio back time though," indicating Biobak is a graphics artist whose available time is a constraint on development.
- **Zeina (Animations):** No relevant information found in this transcript regarding Zeina's contributions.
- **Other Contributors:**
    - **Marty:** "Marty is still working on it [Green Japanese Garden side level]."
    - **Zeno:** "Forgotten Fortress doesn't even have star names yet because we're still waiting for Zeno to finish the last area."
    - **Zell:** "I paid zell to make some changes to missing link" (referring to a separate project/tool, but shows collaboration).

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Sound Engine Overhaul:** A major decision was to rip out and remake the Mario 64 sound engine due to its perceived flaws, aiming for better performance, smaller size, and easier game development.
- **Overworld Design & Cohesion:** Challenges include logically placing key elements (e.g., "Boshi's platform is here, but then Bill's drill is here. And Boshi being right next to the drill is all awkward"), visually representing concepts like a magical barrier around Bowser's drill, and filling large empty areas with meaningful content like a Yoshi playground or hospital.
- **Scope Management for Side Levels:** Kaze actively decides against overly complex new side levels: "The issue I have with it is it's too much work... I want the side levels that we now add to the project to be side levels that are based on a mechanic we already have." This led to the concept of "single mechanic levels."
- **Level Flow and Player Guidance:** Identified issues with the "Grins and Badland" level, where players struggle to find objectives, requiring a redesign. "You enter the level and you kind of have no fucking idea what to do."
- **Implementing New Ideas:** Brainstorming and problem-solving for new level concepts, such as how to make a hide-and-seek level engaging or how an egg-rolling/pinball mechanic would work and fit thematically.
- **Technical Implementation Details:** Briefly touches on issues like getting a temporary skybox to render correctly ("Why is RenderInfo.bg missing now?").

## Business Aspects
- **YouTube Monetization & Sponsorships:** Kaze is working with an agency called LFI to secure sponsorships for his YouTube videos. This is a primary reason for his increased video production: "That's the reason I'm making videos now, because I have sponsors and I need to make videos."
- **Agency Issues:** He is experiencing problems with the agency regarding payments and sales tax: "Something's fucked up, and now I don't know whether I'm actually going to get paid or not, which would be devastating." And, "They're not properly paying sales tax. Apparently."
- **Open Source Release:** Kaze plans to release "Return to Yoshi's Island" (RTYI) as open source: "Will rtyi be open source on release yes definitely i do want people to use my engine to make more romhacks and to improve on my performance optimizations."
- **Small Scale Monetization:** Kaze mentions doing a product review on his second channel in exchange for a free smartphone.

## Key Quotes
- "Basically, I'm trying to fix Mario 64 sound engine. It sucks. I'm kind of just ripping it out, making my own. And it's been a serious effort."
- "The world is done layout-wise, yes... So here's where the detailing work comes in. We need to think of things we want on the island."
- "If anything I want the side levels that we now add to the project to be side levels that are based on a mechanic we already have. That is fun to re-experience and that are pretty short."
- "Are you scared that they will take down the game? No. I mean, they might, but like... If it happens, it happens. It's not the end of the world. I can still just turn it into my own branded game, hopefully."
