## Game Development Process
- The stream focuses heavily on the development and debugging of a specific boss fight: Raphael the Raven on a moon-like planet.
- Key tasks include fixing hurtboxes, implementing boss scaling (visual and hitbox), coding attack patterns (shockwaves, meteors), and adjusting difficulty.
- Kaze is working on a cutscene for Mario and Raphael the Raven's transition to the moon, involving camera work and object movement.
- A significant portion of the stream involves trying to solve how the player returns from the moon level, initially attempting a pipe, then opting to spawn a star directly on the moon.
- He mentions the game being "just over 80 percent" complete.
- Regular activities include compiling code, testing in-game, and identifying/fixing bugs live.
- Kaze is creating complex interactions on a planetary surface, which involves 3D mathematics (matrices, quaternions) for object placement and orientation.

## Personal Insights
- Kaze expresses frustration with "bureaucracy" (seemingly unrelated to the game itself but affecting his mental state).
- He comments on the dichotomy of player feedback regarding difficulty: "Dude, that's fucked up, the comments I get on my YouTube is either like, oh wow, this level looks way too easy, or oh wow, this level looks way too hard. No one ever says Kaze, the difficulty of this looks perfect to me."
- He shows a pragmatic approach to problem-solving, sometimes abandoning complex solutions for simpler ones: "I think the pipe sucks. It sucks programming wise. And it's also not really very visually clear... you know what i'm just gonna spawn the star on top of the moon. i think that's the easiest way to do it."
- Kaze is passionate about the Yoshi's Island theme: "This is Yoshi's Island." and praises its OST.
- He finds questions about the release date annoying: "When people harass me about the release date..."
- He reflects on the difficulty of certain programming tasks: "You guys have no idea how fucked programming this was."

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub (composer):** No direct mention of Badub in this transcript. Kaze plays and praises the "Yoshi's Island OST," indicating its influence or use.
- **Biobak (graphics artist):**
    - Kaze expresses excitement for Biobak's potential contributions to the boss fight's visual appeal: "Dude, Biobank, you can make this fight look so fucking cool with the background. Imagine the whole background here just rotating around."
    - He also mentions a specific visual effect for an intro sequence that Biobak is presumably involved with: "I'm still planning to put that in biobank [cool effect from intro]".
- **Zeina/Zayna (animations):**
    - Credited with some initial logic for an "explosive meteor": "I think Zeyna made it. I just made some small changes..."
    - Kaze states Zayna is actively working on animations: "yeah zena is currently working on all the animations we need..." and later confirms "you sent the animations okay um unfortunately that's gonna be a next time thing".
    - Animations are a known pending task: "it doesn't have any damage. I don't know how to do animations yet. We're working on it."
- **Other Contributors:**
    - **Okayo (video editor):** Kaze mentions paying Okayo to edit his YouTube videos: "It's someone I paid to edit the video. And hopefully he can edit the next few videos for me."
    - **Chat users (e.g., "serveredited"):** Occasionally offer suggestions or engage in discussions that Kaze responds to.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Boss Fight Mechanics (Raphael Raven):**
    - The boss scales up visually and in hitbox size upon taking damage.
    - The boss's attack patterns (speed, frequency of shockwaves) intensify as it takes damage.
    - **Challenge/Solution:** Difficulty balancing is a major concern. Kaze implements a dynamic difficulty where the boss slows down more over time or after certain attacks, making it progressively easier if the player struggles: "we make it slower the longer the fight goes. That way, everyone is guaranteed to beat eventually."
- **Level Progression/Exit (Post-Boss):**
    - **Challenge:** Implementing a pipe for Mario to exit the moon level proved difficult due to rotation and programming complexity.
    - **Decision:** Kaze opts for a simpler solution: spawning the star directly on the moon after the boss is defeated. "you know what i'm just gonna spawn the star on top of the moon. i think that's the easiest way to do it."
- **Hub World Design:**
    - The hub world will be themed after "Yoshi's Tropical Island" from Mario Party.
    - Progression in the overworld will be unlocked using collected coins, e.g., paying to build a bridge or grow a tree.
- **Planetary Mechanics:**
    - **Challenge:** Ensuring objects like the Raven egg, coins, and the exit star correctly orient and stay fixed to the surface of the (presumably spherical and moving) moon. This involves complex 3D math: "how to move the coins into the coordinate system of the planet..."
- **Cutscene Design:**
    - **Challenge:** Creating a compelling and clear cutscene for Mario and Raphael Raven traveling to the moon, involving iterative adjustments to camera angles, focus, and movement paths.
- **Hitbox/Hurtbox Issues:** A recurring technical challenge is ensuring hitboxes and hurtboxes work correctly and scale appropriately with character models.

## Business Aspects
- **YouTube Content Strategy:** Kaze is considering producing more YouTube videos on topics like specific glitches or mechanics in Mario 64 (e.g., "how does the BLG in R64 work," "how do the paintings work").
- **Motivation for Content:** He states, "I'm gonna make more money for my family," suggesting a financial motivation for increasing video output.
- **Leveraging Paid Help:** The hiring of Okayo as a video editor is intended to facilitate easier and higher quality video production: "Especially now that I have a video editor. Wouldn't make it very easy to do."
- **Monetization:** The stream includes mentions of donations from viewers.
- **Release Date Management:** Kaze actively avoids discussing or committing to a release date due to harassment.

## Key Quotes
- "Dude, Biobank, you can make this fight look so fucking cool with the background. Imagine the whole background here just rotating around. How cool is that gonna be?" (Highlighting collaboration and vision for visual spectacle)
- "It's very hard to find the correct velocity there, because if you set it to 0, the fight is laughably easy, and if you set it like what I have right now, it's a little too hard." (On the challenge of game balance)
- "I've been thinking I should make a lot more videos... Stuff that is not super insane tech stuff but that might have a massive view... Especially now that I have a video editor." (Regarding content strategy and leveraging help)
- "The hub world is gonna be Yoshi's Island, of course. You know the Maori Party Board? Yoshi's Tropical Island, where there's fruits everywhere? I want it like that. And the idea is that with the coins that you buy... you can unlock progression in the overworld." (Describing the vision for the hub world)
