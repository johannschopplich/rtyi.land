He also makes broader product/design calls: removing player skins in favor of coin-driven house upgrades/powerups, and considering coin-purchased minigames. The stream includes iterative art-direction feedback with Biobak on a temple area’s clashing colors, plus difficulty tuning prompted by watching Zeina struggle during playtesting.",
