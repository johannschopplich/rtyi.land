He iterates on building textures/colors, discovers that the skybox/fog drastically changes the look, and settles toward a blue-sky/blue-fog direction supported by new music from Badub. He then starts an MS-Paint-style top-down town plan designed for strong first-time player onboarding and N64-friendly culling (a circular town wrapped around a central mountain), while outlining three “outlaw” mini-boss stars (saloon shootout, bank-robber Monty Mole trail, and a train-robbery Goomba gag).",
