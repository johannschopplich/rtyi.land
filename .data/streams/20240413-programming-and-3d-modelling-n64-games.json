He blockouts geometry first (stairs, vines/roots, traversal routes), then begins thinking about UV mapping and later art pass. The stream also surfaces technical instability (crashes/slow loads), a known water crash risk due to outdated step-function support, and a deeper limitation of the decomp workflow: all areas load at once because RoamManager is binary-only, costing RAM. Broader project updates include Course 12 being essentially finished off-stream (pending Zeina animations/signage), Course 13 planning (mysterious ice castle—needs a boss), Course 14 partially built in secret, and Course 15 still undecided.",
