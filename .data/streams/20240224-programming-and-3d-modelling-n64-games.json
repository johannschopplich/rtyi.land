    "summary": "Kaze brings N64 programmer Sauraen on a live call to diagnose why Sauraen’s F3DEX3 microcode (meant to add new graphics features and reduce RDP time) is running slower in Return to Yoshi’s Island than expected. They A/B test old F3DEX3 vs F3DEX2 vs current F3DEX3 on real hardware, disable lighting to isolate costs, and then modify microcode instrumentation to split RSP time into vertex-processing and triangle-processing cycle counters. Results suggest the slowdown is not solely vertex processing; there appears to be ~8–9 ms of additional RSP time unaccounted for by vertex+triangle processing, prompting further profiling plans. After the call, Kaze returns to level work on a Mario Kart 64 “retro pipe” stage (Calamari Desert-inspired), discussing design beats like a timed race, moving train hazards, and visual tweaks.",
