He iterates on the visual/technical approach (zipper vs tape vs box-opening pull tab), keyframes animation speed, and worries about render cost. Mid-stream he discovers a major performance culprit (infinite draw distance left over from an older hack) and fixes it, then spends significant time debugging an emulator-specific Bowser-holding/letting-go bug (Nemu vs Project64), tracing it to vanilla code using actionArg/actionState inconsistently and a reset-intro-scene path being triggered. He also shares a concrete plan for “Galaxy-comet-like” Yoshi bonus missions (~45) and notes Yoshi won’t be in the next demo, plus some thoughts on video titles/shorts monetization.",
