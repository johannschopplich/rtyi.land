    "summary": "Kaze continues overworld and mission polish while nearing the end of a long refactor phase. He fixes/extends a mission intro cutscene using his cutscene engine, then shifts into a larger overworld design problem: how to visually telegraph “Super Happy Tree” seedlings that will regrow after Bowser 2 and become traversal gates—without breaking an existing Shy Guy/melon mission in the same space. He also blocks out and iterates on a new Part 10 entrance concept (a gondola/ship dock platform) so it reads clearly as a level entrance. Along the way he discusses release/legal strategy (removing copyrighted content), workload pressure, and critiques of ROMhack culture driven by attention rather than vision.",
