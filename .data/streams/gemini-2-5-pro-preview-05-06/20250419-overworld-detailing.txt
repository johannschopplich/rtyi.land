## Game Development Process
- **Sound Engine Remake:** A major focus of recent work has been a complete remake of the Mario 64 sound engine. This new engine is stated to be around 80% faster, use a quarter of the code size, require less memory, and support 32 notes instead of 16, allowing for more complex music. It's intended to make bug fixing and adding new sound effects easier.
- **Overworld Development:** Significant effort is being put into designing and refining the game's overworld, described as "the biggest level ever" with potentially "like 30 stars." The process is iterative, with Kaze using placeholder assets and making adjustments to layout, scale, and points of interest (e.g., Yoshi Village, Bowser's area, wool warehouse, flower garden, treehouses) on stream. He mentions sketching levels first.
- **Full Game Release:** Kaze states, "I don't think there will be another demo. The next release will be the full game." This indicates the project is progressing towards completion.
- **Optimization:** While the sound engine remake yields significant optimization, Kaze notes that optimization became a public focal point somewhat incidentally. He continues to work on performance, including addressing issues like unnecessary triangles in meshes, though some are kept for future editability.
- **Texture and Visuals:** Work is ongoing on custom textures and visual refinement. Placeholder visuals are common during the layout phase. Kaze is experimenting with texture combiners and UV mapping to achieve the desired look, particularly for natural elements like mountains and sand.
- **Mechanics:** The overworld will feature "tons of new mechanics." No specific mechanic-based minigames are left to decide, but ideas are welcome.

## Personal Insights
- **On Optimization Perception:** "I don't know, it's kind of weird to me that this whole project became so much about optimization in the public eye. But I guess it was bound to happen. That's just what did well on YouTube, and that's why I kept engaging with that."
- **Game Design Philosophy (Post-Game):** "You know what I kind of don't like in video games? The fact that you spend the whole video game saving the world. But then once you save the world, you're not allowed to explore the saved world... I think I want to change that... I want the player to save the world and then be like, yep, this is the world now. You saved it."
- **Work Ethic & Time Management:** "Honestly, it's not that hard to find time for this stuff. If you think about your day-to-day, I'm sure you'll find that you waste most of your free time."
- **Critique of Other Projects:** Kaze expresses criticism of the Hackamari64 project, citing "weird decisions," difficulty integrating his code, and not keeping vanilla parity despite that being a stated goal.
- **Confidence in Completion:** "But so far I've always finished my hacks. So I'm very confident this one is going to get done soon."

## Collaborator Information
- **OVALT (Composer - likely Badub):**
    - "And this is the current version that 0VALT is working on right now."
    - OVALT is working on numerous songs for the game ("This is just one of like 15 songs," "I do made around 12 OVALT songs").
    - The overworld music will be dynamic: "The song is going to fade whenever you walk to a different area. So the OVALT is going to be insanely full and sprawling with music."
- **Biobak (Graphics Artist):**
    - "Biobank is making a lot of custom textures but not literally every texture is custom."
    - "There's still so many levels for Biobank to rework."
    - Biobak provided a UV mapping plugin for Blender that Kaze uses: "I need the UV mapping plugin that Biobank sent me a couple days ago."
- **Zeina (Animator - Kaze's wife, also known as Zaynab):**
    - No specific information about Zeina's animation contributions to "Return to Yoshi's Island" is present in this transcript. Her name (Zena/Zaynab) is mentioned in a personal context regarding Kaze's move to Canada.
- **Other Contributors:**
    - **DeathWizard:** Mentioned for creating a MIDI sequence that functions as the game Tetris within Mario 64's music format.
    - **Draco:** Kaze mentions "Draco's Mario" as a commission he finished and is waiting for commissioner approval to release. (Not directly RTYI).

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Custom Sound Engine:** Decision to create a new sound engine for improved performance, flexibility in adding sounds/music, and easier bug fixing.
    - *Challenge:* Ongoing sound bugs ("During this stream, you might hear some sound bugs. I am still working on fixing those.").
- **Persistent Post-Game World:** A design goal is for the world to remain "saved" after the player completes the game, allowing continued exploration without resetting progress.
- **Overworld Layout & Density:**
    - *Decision:* Create a very large overworld with many stars and distinct areas.
    - *Challenge:* Filling large spaces effectively to avoid them feeling empty or uninteresting. "But also, we don't want a lot of empty space. So we need to do something." "This is still large and empty. And it sucks."
    - *Solution:* Iterative placement of elements like villages, geographical features (mountains), themed areas (Boshi's target practice, flower farm, treehouses, wool warehouse), and connecting paths.
- **Visuals and N64 Limitations:**
    - *Challenge:* Achieving desired visual detail and aesthetics (e.g., sand texture, mountain appearance) within the N64's technical constraints, particularly with texture formats like I4 leading to color quantization. "The problem is not the color curve, the problem is that I4 has very coarse colors... all this detail is going to be lost to quantization."
    - *Solution:* Experimenting with texture combiners, UV mapping techniques, and custom texture creation to overcome these limitations and improve visual fidelity.
- **RNG Improvement:** Kaze is working on a video about improving RNG in Mario 64, aiming for a "perfect random function" potentially using "real-world entropy" (like temperature). This will likely be implemented in the game.

## Business Aspects
- **Release Strategy:**
    - "The next release will be the full game." No more demos.
    - Release timing is critical: "The thing is I can't release this around the same time as Nintendo releases anything. And I also can't announce a release date around the same time Nintendo releases anything. Because if I do they will literally kill me."
- **Monetization/Funding (Indirectly for Project):**
    - Kaze creates YouTube videos, some of which are sponsored. "It is because I find sponsors and sponsors make videos for us and will pay you a lot of money. So I'm like, okay, I'll make the video. I want the money." This likely supports his ability to dedicate time to projects like RTYI.
- **Legality/Distribution:**
    - Awareness of legal issues regarding assets: "if I want this to all be legal, I would technically need custom textures for everything. But that's something for later if I actually do want to make this a legal game or something." This suggests a potential long-term goal of a fully original asset release.
- **Marketing:**
    - YouTube videos serve as a form of marketing and progress update. Kaze discusses thumbnail and title ideas for upcoming videos.
    - Content for videos is sometimes guided by what performs well on YouTube (e.g., optimization videos).

## Key Quotes
- "But having our own custom sound engine means it will be a lot easier to fix bugs and address issues and add new things and stuff." (Explaining the rationale for a major technical overhaul)
- "I think it would be extremely cool if in this game, for a change, after you save the world, it doesn't reset your save file. It's just you are in the world and the world is saved. And now you're free to do whatever you want." (Highlighting a core, innovative design goal)
- "The thing is I can't release this around the same time as Nintendo releases anything... Because if I do they will literally kill me." (On the practical constraints of releasing a fan project)
- "Yes, everything you see right now is placeholder. As we try to figure out the best way to do this overworld." (Emphasizing the iterative nature of the development process)
