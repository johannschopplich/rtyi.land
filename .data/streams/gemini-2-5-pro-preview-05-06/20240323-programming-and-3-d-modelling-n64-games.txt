## Game Development Process
- The game "Return to Yoshi's Island" is in its later stages, with Kaze stating, "only three levels are missing and i already finished one area of that that's like end game."
- Significant off-stream work has been done on secret areas and engine polishing.
- A major focus is ensuring the game runs on actual N64 hardware, with recent success in getting parts of the game to run at "40 FPS before we even optimized it," though some areas like the "overworld is fucked" and crashes occur.
- Kaze is also working on a smaller, "secret project" referred to as a "ROM-Mech" using the same engine.
- Current stream focus is on programming "Boshi, the dino with the gun," including a duel minigame.

## Personal Insights
- Kaze is highly passionate about his work, expressing excitement: "Dude, I wish I could show you guys what I made upstream. It's so cool."
- He takes pride in his custom engine: "Well, basically everything I'm going to release is going to use my engine."
- He has a pragmatic approach to development, willing to simplify features if they become too complex to implement effectively (e.g., the duel countdown).
- Kaze is aware of and somewhat resigned to the possibility of Nintendo takedowns, based on past experiences: "A lot of people tell me that they're worried that this game is going to get taken down by nintendo but i never understood what they think that would look like..."
- He values open source principles for software like Blender: "And it is open source, which means it's actually going to be good in 5 years."

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: [No specific new information about Badub's contributions during this stream segment, though listed as a known composer for the project.]
- Biobak: A graphics artist who reviews and improves Kaze's models: "usually after I'm done, we got Biobank looking over it and he makes them a lot better."
- Zeina: Implied to work on animations. Kaze mentions, "Can you believe Zeyna's on babysitting instead of making games with me right now?"
- Other Contributors:
    - **Leela:** Collaborating on the "secret project" (ROM-Mech). Working on implementing Quaternions into the engine, which will allow for "free translation" in animations. Described as "another RobMaker" Kaze is collaborating with.
    - **UED:** Provided the 3D model for the cork gun used in the Boshi duel: "Good thing UED has sent me a model of it."
    - **CX-Linx:** A community member Kaze interacts with during technical discussions.
    - **Unnamed individual:** Emailed Kaze a "new sine and cosine approximation that might actually be worth it."

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Boshi Duel Minigame:**
    - Designing a quick-draw duel mechanic: "3, 2, 1 and then there's a random delay and it says go. And you gotta press B to shoot him."
    - Penalty for shooting early: "If you shoot early your gun will blow up in your face."
    - Iterating on the countdown presentation: Initially considered a HUD countdown, but shifted to a full cutscene due to programming complexity: "Wait, a HUD countdown is gonna suck to program... we'll just make a cutscene fuck it this is painful to do without a cutscene."
    - Balancing reaction time: "first attempt is really difficult i'm thinking like 280 millisecond reaction time and then every time you lose you get like three frames more reaction time." This also needs to account for modern display lag.
    - Camera work for the cutscene: Involves significant trial and error to get framing right for both widescreen and 4:3 aspect ratios.
- **Performance and N64 Hardware:**
    - Constant effort to optimize for N64 hardware, including fixing crashes (e.g., "the overworld is fucked").
    - Implementing culling techniques: "You see these beams here? We can make it so that they cull... We can just make it not process the triangles at all."
    - Addressing RAM limitations, e.g., by decimating models like the egg.
- **Animation System Limitations:** Mario 64's animation system doesn't inherently support translation for animated objects beyond the first frame, requiring workarounds.
- **"Save State Yoshi" Raps:** A unique, if controversial, feature where a Yoshi character raps at the player for using save states. Kaze defends the creative choice despite some chat members finding them "cringe."

## Business Aspects
- **Future Projects & Funding:** Kaze plans to launch a Kickstarter for an original game after "Return to Yoshi's Island": "i'm gonna bundle it together with the ad for my kickstarter for the game i'm gonna make after i'm done with return to yoshi's islands."
- **Monetization Stance:** He is against making Patreon-exclusive content for this ROM hack: "I'm not making any Patreon exclusives. I don't want people to even think I'm trying to bait people into my Patreon."
- **Release Strategy Concerns:** Worried about timing the ROM hack's release to avoid coinciding with major Nintendo game releases, which he believes increases the likelihood of a takedown: "if you release your romhack around the same time as a big nintendo game comes out you are going to get taken down 100% like right away."
- **Copyright & Takedowns:** Has experienced numerous video takedowns by Nintendo previously (affecting "70 of my videos," including Blender tutorials and Net64 showcases) and anticipates potential takedown of the game's trailer, planning a "copyright free version."

## Key Quotes
- "Do you guys actually realize how crazy it is how close we're done to being done like only three levels are missing and i already finished one area of that that's like end game but it's still gonna take a long time but still it's like it's the last fifth of the game that feels like end stretch to me." (Reflecting on project progress)
- "Well, basically everything I'm going to release is going to use my engine." (On the versatility and importance of his custom engine)
- "A lot of people tell me that they're worried that this game is going to get taken down by nintendo but i never understood what they think that would look like... they already did that [takedowns on videos]." (On the ever-present Nintendo concern)

## Potential Interview Topics
- **The Vision for "Return to Yoshi's Island":** Beyond being a ROM hack, what is the overarching creative vision and desired player experience for this game? What personal significance does this project hold?
- **Collaborative Dynamics:** Explore the nature of Kaze's collaborations (with Biobak, Leela, Zeina, UED, etc.). How are these partnerships formed and maintained, especially in a remote, fan-driven project environment?
- **Navigating the "Nintendo Risk":** A deeper discussion on how the threat of Nintendo takedowns influences Kaze's development choices, release strategies, and his general philosophy on creating fan works.
