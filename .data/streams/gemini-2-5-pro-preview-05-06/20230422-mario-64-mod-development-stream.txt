## Game Development Process
- The game "Return to Yoshi's Island" (RTYI) is in active development, with a current focus on a complex Bowser boss fight, including his AI, movement mechanics (walk cycle, step-up physics), and interaction with Mario (tail grab).
- The game has evolved significantly from its demo version, with Kaze stating, "the actual final game is so unrecognizable from the demo right now it's actually crazy."
- Continuous engine optimization is a major part of the process. Kaze is constantly finding and implementing new optimizations, such as improved sine/cosine functions and fixes for fundamental SM64 engine bugs like "floor clacking."
- Development involves integrating assets from collaborators, debugging interactions (e.g., Mario's grab, object interaction boxes), and refining existing elements (e.g., ResNor model, tutorial signs).
- RTYI is the primary focus, with potential plans to release its optimizations for base SM64 at a later date. The goal is for RTYI to run at 60 FPS.
- Bug fixing is an ongoing, iterative process, often involving live debugging during streams and checking code history (e.g., via GitHub desktop).

## Personal Insights
- Kaze expresses strong confidence in his coding abilities, humorously stating, "I literally was just born with the ability to code." He distinguishes between coding skill (innate understanding) and coding knowledge (learned).
- He holds firm game design philosophies, notably a strong dislike for excessive player options: "I hate options. I think games should give you as few options as possible... More options, more confusion." He believes fewer options lead to a more consistent and curated player experience.
- Kaze believes his ROM hacking activities are "perfectly legal" and that Nintendo "literally cannot ban me from doing this."
- He is driven by a desire to create a highly polished and technically proficient game, evident in his deep dives into engine optimization.
- He is open about his personal background, mentioning he started programming at age 12 and currently works as a kitchen cook, though he is also a professional Unreal Engine developer.

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub (Composer):** No relevant information found in this transcript regarding Badub's specific contributions to RTYI.
- **Biobak (Graphics Artist):**
    - Provides 3D models for the game.
    - Mentioned as having sent a model for "tutorial bunnies" that Kaze was integrating.
    - Contributed to the new Bowser model, providing updated geometry and textures. Kaze worked on tweaking/integrating this model.
- **Zeina (Animator / Kaze's wife):**
    - Responsible for animations and artwork for RTYI. She mentions, "Zaina's job here is animations and artwork."
    - Created an animation for "Bowser getting hit" and is working on a "Bowser's showcase."
    - Is developing a "new animation format" for Mario, which Kaze notes will require significant integration work.
    - Actively participates in the stream chat and sometimes speaks on mic.
- **Other Contributors:**
    - **EasyAsPi** (Discord user): Credited with the idea of using imaginary numbers for a sine/cosine function optimization, making it "twice as fast."

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Boss Mechanics:** A significant challenge is programming Bowser's boss fight, including his movement AI (getting him beyond a "Roomba" state), step-up physics for navigating terrain, and the tail-grab mechanic. The fight is intended to have multiple phases.
- **Engine Limitations & Optimizations:** Overcoming SM64 engine limitations is a recurring theme. A major challenge was "floor clacking" (or "surface cocking"), a bug in SM64's collision detection, which Kaze addressed with a custom optimization that involves sorting surfaces and iterating minimal data.
- **Player Experience & Options:** A core design decision is to limit player options to create a focused and consistent experience. Kaze argues, "a bunch of options are just unnecessarily confusing and people aren't going to have all the same experience, which I don't like."
- **Movement System:** Emphasis on "sick movement" for Mario, including new abilities like long jumping out of a long jump landing and jumping out of a triple jump landing.
- **Visuals and Performance:** Addressing visual issues like pop-in for distant background elements (e.g., Yoshi ships) while maintaining performance is an ongoing task. Kaze experimented with scaling objects in to reduce jarring pop-in.
- **Asset Integration:** Integrating new models and animations (e.g., tutorial bunnies, updated ResNor, Bowser model) and ensuring they function correctly with existing physics and rendering systems presents regular challenges (e.g., lighting issues, object physics).

## Business Aspects
- **Release Strategy & IP Concerns:** Kaze plans to "delay open sourcing the game a little from the initial release, just so Nintendo doesn't instantly take it down." He suggests a delay of "maybe like two months," also to hide Easter eggs.
- **Monetization/Funding:** Kaze relies on community support for his work. He mentions, "My youtube learns like a slight bits my patron is like the biggest income."
- **Platform Choice (Streaming):** The decision to switch from Twitch to YouTube for streaming was partly financial. Kaze noted, "Twitch actually only gives you a 50-50 card, which sucks. I think YouTube is 70-30. It's another good reason to switch to YouTube."

## Key Quotes
- "the actual final game is so unrecognizable from the demo right now it's actually crazy" - Kaze, on the game's evolution.
- "So since we need to fix floor clacking like this... I had the idea, what if we just keep the sorting priority, and we kill all the floors that are too high, and then we can just only iterate 0x10 bytes of each floor?" - Kaze, detailing a significant technical optimization.
- "I hate options. I think games should give you as few options as possible... a bunch of options are just unnecessarily confusing and people aren't going to have all the same experience, which I don't like." - Kaze, on his game design philosophy.

## Potential Interview Topics
- The specific technical breakthroughs in RTYI (like the floor collision fix) and how they push the boundaries of what's possible in an SM64 ROM hack.
- Kaze's design philosophy regarding player choice and curated experiences, and how it manifests in RTYI's level and game design.
- The collaborative dynamic between Kaze, Zaina, and Biobak, exploring how their individual contributions shape the final game and the process of integrating diverse assets.
- Kaze's long-term vision for RTYI, its place within the SM64 modding community, and his thoughts on the future of large-scale fan projects.
- Navigating the creative and technical challenges of building a full-scale game on a heavily modified, existing engine, particularly the balance between preserving the SM64 feel and introducing new mechanics.
