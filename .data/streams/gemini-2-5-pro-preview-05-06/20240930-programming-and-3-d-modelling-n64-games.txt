## Game Development Process
-   The stream focuses on the development of a Thwomp enemy, including modeling, texturing (papercraft/cardboard aesthetic), and behavior (googly eyes).
-   Significant progress is being made on "Course 1," with Kaze integrating a major rework provided by collaborator Biobak. This includes debugging rendering issues, lighting, and material properties.
-   Kaze mentions that "every level will get a Biobank rework."
-   A "Course 1 demo" is planned, which is a reason for the focused effort on this particular course.
-   The game is planned to have 15 courses. Course 14 is in progress, and Course 15 ("Halloween of Ardor") is about halfway complete.
-   Off-stream work includes the creation of a "soul enemy" and a "Z button hit" feature (likely a combat mechanic).
-   "Thimble guys" (another enemy type) are considered complete.
-   The game is being built using the Mario 64 decompilation and is intended to run on actual N64 hardware.

## Personal Insights
-   Kaze has a clear artistic vision, particularly for the Thwomp's papercraft aesthetic: "I want this to look like a swamp. It's very important to me."
-   He is open to iteration and remaking assets if they don't meet his standards: "yeah actually fuck this let's remake this" (referring to the Thwomp model).
-   Kaze engages with his audience for suggestions (e.g., level names, Thwomp design) but ultimately makes the final creative decisions: "the names are good enough but i don't exclude the possibility that there's an even better one... i would never just be like yep we found the perfect thing."
-   He reflects on the game's narrative, mentioning an earlier, darker plot idea that was revised: "First, the plot was Bowser goes to Yoshi's Island and captures all the Yoshis and makes them work for him. But a whole slavery plot is maybe a bit too much for a Mario game. We definitely still have to do something like that, something Bowser threatens the Yoshis."
-   He expresses opinions on technical aspects, such as being skeptical of Level of Detail (LODs): "I'm not really a believer in lots. I think lots are very overrated."

## Collaborator Information
-   **Badub (Composer):** The game's soundtrack is referred to as "Paper Gem OST." Kaze asks for "any ost wishes today," and a viewer suggests "paper gem ost," indicating Badub's musical contributions are integral and recognized.
-   **Biobak (Graphics Artist):** Biobak is a key collaborator responsible for significant graphical reworks of levels, most notably "Course 1" during this stream. He provides Kaze with updated level files, and Kaze spends considerable time integrating these changes, troubleshooting technical issues (lighting, Z-Buffer, shaders, render order), and discussing Biobak's design choices. Biobak also created the base model for the Thwomp Kaze is working on.
-   **Xena (Animator/Asset Creator):** Mentioned as a potential contributor for a specific asset: "Xena says the farm will offer her to make a red banner. I can let her know." This suggests Xena contributes art assets for the game.
-   **Other Contributors:** Viewers in the live chat actively provide suggestions for level names ("paper craft peaks or handmade heights"), Thwomp design ideas (e.g., "duct tape eyebrows," "visible glue"), and general feedback, which Kaze acknowledges and sometimes considers.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
-   **Thwomp Enemy Design:**
    -   **Aesthetic:** A major focus is on making the Thwomp fit a "papercraft" or "handmade" theme, experimenting with looks like construction paper, paper box, origami, and cardboard. Decisions involve texture, shininess, visible folds, and materials like duct tape for eyebrows.
    -   **Features:** Implementing dynamic "googly eyes" that can move independently and react to attacks. Designing an "angry" facial expression.
    -   **Sound Design:** Considering a "rattling sound when he hits the floor" and potentially snow-like impact sounds.
-   **Level Design & Reworks (especially Course 1):**
    -   **Iterative Process:** Course 1 is undergoing extensive reworks by Biobak, requiring Kaze to integrate, debug, and refine. The stated goal is to create another "Course 1 demo."
    -   **Technical Challenges:** Frequent issues with rendering (sky, clouds, transparency, Z-Buffer, render order), lighting adjustments, material properties ("This is the most fucked material ever"), and ensuring compatibility and performance.
    -   **Specific Changes to Course 1 (based on Biobak's rework):** Repositioning lens flare, adding more room around a treehouse, carrot-filled caves, relocating graffiti, changing castle color to red, adding new railings and roofs, improving lighting, and introducing new tree textures. A "retro area" within Course 1 is being designed with flat shading and camera-based lighting.
-   **Narrative Revision:** The initial plot involving Bowser enslaving Yoshis was deemed "a bit too much for a Mario game." The story is being revised to be less severe but will still involve Bowser threatening the Yoshis.
-   **Overall Game Structure:** Levels are designed to be large, open Mario 64-style worlds. However, collecting "stars" (or their equivalent) will lead to "entrances to either like linear challenges or like puzzles or stuff like that," aiming for "more meat to the stars."
-   **Enemy Behavior:** The "soul enemy" is described as a "very strong enemy." Thwomps will have the ability to look around.
-   **Technical Foundation:** The game must run on N64 hardware. Kaze discusses polygon limits (e.g., Thwomp around 164 polygons, other enemies 60-300), Z-buffering, shader usage, and texture filtering.

## Business Aspects
-   **Return to Yoshi's Island:** No direct mentions of funding, marketing strategies, or a fixed release date for this specific project. When pressed by chat for a Christmas release, Kaze humorously deflects.
-   **Potential Commissioned Project:** Kaze mentions a separate game idea, "Daisy's Fury with Luigi" (inspired by Bowser's Fury), which someone on Twitter offered to pay him to make. Kaze states, "if he does. I will do it." This is distinct from "Return to Yoshi's Island."

## Key Quotes
-   "I want this to look like a swamp. It's very important to me." (Kaze, on the Thwomp's design, emphasizing his commitment to a specific aesthetic.)
-   "First, the plot was Bowser goes to Yoshi's Island and captures all the Yoshis and makes them work for him. But a whole slavery plot is maybe a bit too much for a Mario game." (Kaze, reflecting on the narrative development and tonal considerations.)
-   "Basically the way most levels work is that it's like open like a Mario 64 world. It's a lot bigger and then instead of finding stars you find entrances to either like linear challenges or like puzzles or stuff like that. So there's a lot more meat to the stars." (Kaze, explaining the core structural design of the game's levels.)
-   "We spent the most of your development time on course one. The most. How do you define what the most is here? Because it's not more than 50%. I can tell you that much. It's also not more than 10%. The development time spent on course one is probably like 7%." (Kaze, responding to a viewer about Course 1 development time, highlighting the iterative nature and detailed work involved, even if it's not the bulk of total time.)

## Potential Interview Topics
1.  **The "Handmade" Aesthetic:** Explore the conceptual origins and evolution of the "papercraft"/"handmade" visual theme for "Return to Yoshi's Island." How does this aesthetic choice influence gameplay mechanics, enemy design (like the Thwomp), and the overall player experience?
