## Game Development Process
- The game "Return to Yoshi's Island" (RTYI) is estimated to be 75-80% complete.
- Kaze is currently working on Course 11 of a planned 15 courses.
- Current development focus includes bug fixing across all levels to prepare for beta testing, and level design/implementation for new areas like the "OBB underground" (Oily Boily Bay underground).
- A significant portion of early development involved creating the custom game engine.
- Kaze follows self-imposed deadlines to maintain progress, having successfully met them for 14 consecutive days at the time of the stream.
- Key tasks include fixing bugs ("doors always so fucked up," culling issues, object update order), implementing new enemy behaviors (Chompy, oil puddle enemy), and level detailing (slides, hydraulic platforms, textures).

## Personal Insights
- Kaze Emanuar expresses a strong work ethic, emphasizing his commitment to deadlines: "I started setting myself deadlines for stuff to work on right so I've done this for 14 days now and so far I fit every single deadline."
- He holds critical views on modern game design, stating: "I don't like modern game design. Modern game design is made for people that are depressed and just want to erase time. Not for people that want to go have an experience."
- Kaze is passionate about making RTYI a unique experience, even if it means it's niche: "I don't think a pc port of this game will ever exist... but I seriously doubt anyone is gonna have the skill to make a pc port of this or the patience because it's just gonna take so long."
- He values player experience and aims to make the game engaging without unnecessary time-wasting: "The game doesn't waste your time. That is important to me."
- He has a specific philosophy on game difficulty, prioritizing "cool" and engaging challenges over arbitrary difficulty.

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub (Musician/Composer):** While not explicitly named in this transcript excerpt, Kaze mentions plans for the game's music: "I feel like when RTYI releases, I want to pay the musician to have the rights to the music and then release an album for RTYI." (The prompt implies Badub is the composer).
- **Biobak (Graphics Artist):** Kaze directly interacts with Biobak during the stream regarding a sail texture, discussing N64 texture limitations and optimization: "Can you send me like a blender file with just the sail then I can see what I can do... Does this work for you, Biobank? This is the most cursed texture resolution I've ever seen."
- **Lila (Animator):** Lila is working on "quaternion animations" which are critical for the game, particularly for fixing issues like door animations. Kaze states: "if Lila disappears before finishing the quaternion animations I will be so sad... until we have Lila's quaternion animation exporter... we cannot fix the doors." Lila was subject to a running gag about her "death" but appeared in chat during the stream. (The prompt mentioned Zeina for animations; this transcript refers to Lila for this role).
- **Other Contributors:**
    - No other direct RTYI development contributors are clearly identified with specific, ongoing roles in this transcript, though chat members provide feedback and ideas. SimpleFlips is mentioned in the context of a past commissioned mod, not RTYI.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **N64 Hardware Limitations:** A recurring major challenge is working within the N64's constraints, especially texture memory (4096 bytes for all combined textures) and resolution. Kaze frequently devises workarounds like "cursed texture resolutions" (e.g., 96x42).
- **Level Design (OBB Underground):** This area is designed as the "inner workings of the oil rig," featuring slides, numerous hydraulic press platforms, and an industrial aesthetic. The goal is to make it look like "a bunch of machines just working."
- **Enemy Design:** The "Chompy" has new actions and an HD model. An "oil puddle enemy" (similar to 3D World's "bits") is planned for the OBB underground.
- **Difficulty Balancing:** Kaze's approach is "I don't try to make the levels more difficult. I just put the threshold of how cool a jump has to be for it to be worth the difficulty lower." The game will also include mechanics to assist less skilled players.
- **Player Experience:** Decisions like making the file select a 3D level and avoiding going back to a hub on death (respawning at level start) are made to enhance player immersion and reduce frustration while maintaining impact.
- **Bug Fixing:** Significant time is spent on fixing bugs related to culling, object update order (especially for dynamic platforms like hydraulics), and animation-dependent objects like doors.

## Business Aspects
- **Future Game Development & Funding:** Kaze plans to develop a new, unrelated game in Unreal Engine and launch a Kickstarter campaign for it simultaneously with the release of RTYI: "simultaneously with the release of Return to Yoshi's Island we are going to start a Kickstarter for this game in Unreal Engine."
- **YouTube Monetization:** Kaze relies on YouTube ad revenue ("The ad revenue on YouTube is so high. I'm making bank around Christmas") and sponsorships (e.g., a Honkai Star Rail promotion: "I'm definitely taking that sponsorship").
- **RTYI Merchandising:** He expresses interest in releasing the RTYI soundtrack as an album, potentially on a physical N64-style cartridge, after securing rights from the musician.
- **Open Source:** RTYI's source code will be made public, though Kaze is skeptical about anyone successfully porting it to PC due to its complexity.

## Key Quotes
- "I'm going through all the levels from correspond to the last person fixing all the bugs that have appeared so that we can beta test every single level." (Shows current development stage and dedication to quality)
- "N64 like all textures combined to take up the resolution that the n64 can hold wow this fucking sucks... Fast64 shows you this year memory usage 4096 out of 4096 bytes." (Highlights a core technical challenge)
- "simultaneously with the release of Return to Yoshi's Island we are going to start a Kickstarter for this game in Unreal Engine and then we will make big money." (Reveals ambitious future plans and funding strategy)
- "I don't like modern game design. Modern game design is made for people that are depressed and just want to erase time. Not for people that want to go have an experience." (Provides insight into Kaze's game design philosophy)
