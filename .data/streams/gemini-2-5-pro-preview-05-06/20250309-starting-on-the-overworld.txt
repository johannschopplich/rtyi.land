## Game Development Process
- **Overall Progress:** The game "Return to Yoshi's Island" (RTYI) is in a late stage of development. All 15 main courses are complete.
- **Current Focus:** Development is currently centered on the overworld (which will have 14-15 distinct parts), remaining side levels, and incorporating reworks from collaborator Biobank.
- **Overworld Development Strategy:** Kaze plans to design all overworld parts simultaneously as a basic blockout, then adjust them. The process involves:
    1. Rough draft/blockout of all areas.
    2. Implementation of gameplay elements.
    3. Beta testing.
    4. Visual polishing and making them "look nice."
- **Beta Testing:**
    - Beta testing for RTYI is planned to start "pretty soon," possibly before the overworld is entirely finished.
    - The initial RTYI beta will involve sending demos with single levels to testers for iterative feedback and improvement.
    - Kaze is also starting beta testing for another, unrelated game called "Direct Mario."
- **Milestones:**
    - Completion of all 15 main courses is a major milestone.
    - The next significant milestone appears to be a functional, draft version of the entire overworld.

## Personal Insights
- **Importance of Overworld:** Kaze considers the overworld to be "the most important part of the game" and is dedicating significant effort and care to its design to ensure it's intriguing and engaging.
- **Personal Enjoyment as a Motivator:** Kaze states, "generally I do not like developing games that I personally wouldn't enjoy," indicating his passion for the project and his creative choices are driven by his own interest.
- **Design Philosophies:**
    - Believes "contrast is what makes the art," referring to level design that can feel oppressive initially before opening up.
    - Values creating emotional bonds between players and game elements, citing Pokémon Red/Blue's battle system as an example of fostering value for a player's companions.
    - Expresses a dislike for SM64 randomizers that lack inherent design, preferring procedurally generated content with more structure.
- **Development Approach:** He is transparent about the development process, including challenges and unfinished aspects, but also expresses frustration with repetitive questions about obvious bugs in work-in-progress elements.

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub (Composer):** No direct mention of Badub or specific musical contributions in this transcript. Kaze generally mentions, "I was thinking I would buy the rights for the music at the end and then make an OST cartridge," indicating music is a planned component.
- **Biobank (Graphics Artist/Level Reworker):**
    - Biobank is "reworking all the levels."
    - Kaze is paying Biobank "a lot for that," highlighting a significant financial aspect of the collaboration. This work is one of the remaining major tasks for the game.
- **Zeina (Animations):** While not explicitly detailed as working on RTYI in this stream, Kaze discusses "new idle animations" and chat mentions fixing "the head animation." This suggests ongoing animation work for Kaze's projects, which typically involves Zeina. Mario's model is also being reworked, which is tied to animation.
- **Other Contributors:**
    - **"My editor"**: Kaze mentions having a video editor whom he needs to pay, funded by YouTube sponsorships. This supports his content creation which, in turn, can fund game development.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Overworld Design & Scale:**
    - A recurring challenge is getting the scale and layout of overworld sections right so they are engaging and not "too fucking big" or "unfun to walk around."
    - The goal for the initial overworld area is "to build intrigue in the player" and "Ignite the desire... to want to explore the next part."
    - Iterative design is evident, with Kaze frequently adjusting layouts, sizes, and element placements based on "how it feels."
    - The overworld will feature 14-15 interconnected parts, compared in complexity more to Banjo-Kazooie than SM64.
- **Non-Deterministic RNG:**
    - Kaze created a new, faster random number generation function.
    - An unintended consequence is that it "kind of uses like true noise on accident so it may be impossible to test this game" (specifically for Tool-Assisted Speedruns due to lack of determinism, even across save states on emulators and real hardware).
- **Tutorialization and Player Guidance:**
    - Emphasis on subtle tutorialization: the first swimming experience is in shallow water; a Cheep Cheep holding a sign is planned to teach swimming controls.
    - Initial overworld design aims to make the player feel "stuck" briefly to encourage exploration before finding the first course (Bunny Brushwoods). Course 1's entrance (a barrel) might be blocked by a Pachyderm, requiring coins or knowledge of ground-pounding to pass.
- **Mario's Model & Animations:**
    - Mario's model is still being reworked. This is a reason for not immediately fixing certain visual bugs (like the hat texture when Mario takes it off), as the fix would need to be redone.
- **Progression and Unlocks:**
    - The overworld will change as the player progresses (e.g., a Bowser door requiring 4 stars, a Course 2 door requiring 1 star).
    - A "message in a bottle" event is planned after 2-3 stars, leading to a secret star.
- **Performance:** Kaze emphasizes caring about performance, aiming for the game to run well on N64 hardware, contrasting with some modern unoptimized games.

## Business Aspects
- **Funding Model:**
    - The game's development is costly, with Kaze stating, "The game as a whole is going to cost me in the tens of thousands."
    - Funding comes from his Patreon, YouTube channel (ad revenue, sponsorships), and donations.
    - He mentions the possibility of starting a "donation drive" to cover costs, particularly for paying collaborators like Biobank.
- **Monetization of Content:**
    - Kaze waits for sponsors to release some of his planned YouTube videos, as he needs to pay his video editor.
    - He humorously mentions product placement as potentially "the only way to monetize romhacking."
- **Release/Distribution:**
    - Primarily a ROM hack for N64 emulators/hardware.
    - There's a passing thought about a potential PC port: "There's a consideration to strip this off copyright stuff and, like, put it out as a PC game as well. So, like, everyone can just play it without needing an emulator."
    - Kaze mentions potentially making an OST cartridge if he buys music rights.

## Key Quotes
- "We basically just finished course 15, which means all the main courses are done. Now, all that's remaining is some side levels, Biobank's reworks, and the overworld." (Provides a clear status update on game completion.)
- "I think the overworld is the most important part of the game. So we're putting a lot of care into this." (Highlights Kaze's focus and the significance of the overworld in RTYI.)
- "The game as a whole is going to cost me in the tens of thousands... Yes, Biobank is reworking all the levels and I have to pay him a lot for that." (Emphasizes the financial commitment and collaborative nature of the project.)
- "I made a new random function... it kind of uses like true noise on accident so it may be impossible to test this game." (Reveals a unique technical aspect and an associated challenge.)

## Potential Interview Topics
- **The Vision for the Overworld:** Explore Kaze's initial vision for such an expansive and interconnected overworld in RTYI and how that vision has evolved through the development process shown in the stream.
