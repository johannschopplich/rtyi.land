## Game Development Process
- **Current Focus:** The stream heavily focuses on the visual refinement and technical implementation of a desert-themed level, specifically addressing quicksand appearance, skybox design, background elements (cliffs), and fog effects. This indicates a stage of detailed level construction and aesthetic polishing.
- **Iterative Approach:** Kaze demonstrates a highly iterative development style, constantly trying different textures, shaders (combiners), and geometric arrangements, then immediately testing and evaluating the results. He states, "Yeah, these are the kind of things where you just have to try, see what happens, see how it turns out, I find."
- **Performance Optimization:** A significant portion is dedicated to N64 performance, discussing render distance, overdraw, polygon counts, and potential benefits from F3DX3 (a custom microcode) and culling. He mentions aiming for solid frame rates even with complex visuals: "30. And we didn't even optimize or put FADX3 in yet. Oh, that's crazy." He later discovers culling wasn't even enabled, implying significant performance gains are still possible.
- **Tooling:** Kaze mentions using tools like Fast64 (a Mario 64 level editor) and Blender, and encountering/working around their limitations or bugs (e.g., "Fast64 rendering bug," "fast64 resetting my hex edits").
- **Hardware Testing:** He performs tests on actual N64 hardware ("Let's check this out on N64 and see how it performs") to get accurate performance metrics beyond emulation.

## Personal Insights
- **Artistic Vision & Frustration:** Kaze has a strong vision for the game's aesthetics and "vibe," particularly concerning the fog color ("The fog color right now is very essential for the art style here. Making it all yellow would change the vibe a lot."). He expresses frustration when technical hurdles or tool limitations impede this vision (e.g., "Dude, I gotta get rid of this cliff in the skybox, it is pissing me off," "This combiner is unworkable").
- **Problem-Solving Attitude:** Despite frustrations, he displays a persistent problem-solving approach, exploring various technical solutions for visual challenges, often thinking aloud and engaging with chat for ideas.
- **Humor and Candor:** Kaze is candid about his process, mistakes, and opinions, often using humor (e.g., "What an animation, I call the animation comedy death," "Surely sand 6 will be better than sand 21, clueless"). He also briefly rants about YouTube recommendations, showing a more personal side.
- **Pride in Optimization:** He shows pride in pushing the N64's capabilities, especially regarding his project's optimization compared to others ("How the fuck did LRT not even reach solid 30 FPS? Because they ain't me."). He also brags about Sauron's assessment of RTYI's optimization.

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub (presumed "my dupe"):**
    - Contribution: Composer for the game. Kaze states, "...my dupe wants to make all of it," referring to the music.
    - Interaction: Kaze hopes to release an OST cartridge alongside the game, implying a significant and valued contribution from the composer.
- **Biobak:**
    - Contribution: Graphics artist. Kaze mentions, "He wanted to help me rework a bunch of levels."
    - Interaction/Status: Kaze expresses concern: "Dude, has anyone seen Biobank recently? He's been gone for a while... I hope he's not gone. That'd be really unfortunate for the case empire." This suggests Biobak is a valued contributor whose absence is felt.
- **Zeina:**
    - No relevant information found in this transcript regarding Zeina or animations. The "comedy death" animation mentioned at the start seems to be Kaze's own experiment or a placeholder.
- **Other Contributors:**
    - **Sauron:** Working on F3DX3 (a custom N64 microcode) optimization. Kaze states Sauron "thinks that in Return to Yoshi's Island the memory and RDP is so optimized that with F3dx3 the RSP becomes the bottleneck. And because F3dx3 has more RSP costs, that is likely it. So he's making a version of F3dx3 that has some optimized RDSP." This collaboration is key for performance.
    - **Eric:** Kaze asks, "Does Eric hack quicksand right now?" This sounds like another ROM hacker whose work Kaze might be following or referencing, rather than a direct collaborator on RTYI from this specific transcript.
    - **Chat (Clayman, Cack Honka Honka, g-boy, Rainy, Liliana, Jan, Agirov, Seymour Sam, etc.):** While not formal collaborators, the chat actively provides suggestions and feedback that Kaze sometimes considers or responds to (e.g., "Can't you render the distance cliffs in another layer like OOT renders in Skybox? Yes, that's what I would do.").

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Skybox and Background Aesthetics:** A major challenge is creating a convincing and aesthetically pleasing skybox/background that integrates with the level, manages render distance, and avoids looking "floaty." Kaze experiments with distant cliffs, fog, color matching, and parallax effects.
    - *Challenge:* "One thing I worry about is that players might think they have to go to the bottom here. I'd like to prevent that a lot."
    - *Solution Attempt:* Fading distant elements into fog or a background color, using multiple layers for cliffs.
- **Quicksand Visuals:** Finding a good visual representation for quicksand that looks appealing and functional.
    - *Challenge:* Initial attempts look "terrible." "Quicksand is not it, definitely not."
    - *Solution Attempt:* Experimenting with textures, shaders (combiners), fading edges, and ensuring it's visually distinct from walkable ground.
- **Performance vs. Visual Fidelity:** Constantly balancing the desire for complex, appealing visuals with the N64's hardware limitations.
    - *Challenge:* "The problem is, this texture is so big that it is not possible to make it slowly move, at least not cheaply."
    - *Decision:* Opting for solutions that are "cheap to render," simplifying geometry, and relying on upcoming F3DX3 optimizations.
- **Art Style Consistency:** Maintaining a cohesive art style, especially regarding colors (e.g., the importance of the blue fog, reluctance to change it).
    - *Challenge:* "The fog color right now is very essential for the art style here... Making it all yellow would change the vibe a lot."
- **Level Element: Train:** Integrating a moving train element, including fixing its rotation and pitch to match the surface.

## Business Aspects
- **Potential for an N64 Game in 2024:** Kaze mentions, "So, yeah, so fun fact, there was a company that approached me recently and they said they want to make an N64 game in 2024. Looks like they might be doing it, but we'll find out in June." He discusses the marketing potential: "...if you have the marketing of, hey, this is an N64 game, but there's also a PC port available, it's kind of insane. That would make the news and you would get so much marketing for free."
- **OST Release:** "I'm hoping that I can release RTYI alongside an OST cartridge." This indicates a plan for a physical or distributable product related to the game.
- **Marketing Awareness (General):** While RTYI is a ROM hack, Kaze shows an understanding of game marketing principles when discussing the potential N64 company project.
