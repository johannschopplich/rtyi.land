## Game Development Process
- Currently focused on developing "Course 12," a mine-themed area, which involves significant restructuring and iterative design based on playtesting and Kaze's evaluation of level quality.
- The project is substantially progressed, with Course 12 being "12 out of 15" planned courses.
- Kaze's workflow generally involves establishing level design and geometry first, followed by detailed visual work and polish.
- Key activities include 3D modeling, level layout, implementing gameplay mechanics (e.g., wobbly platforms, planned minecarts), enemy placement, and collectible (Red Coin) distribution.
- Technical aspects include fixing compiler warnings, working with emulators, UV unwrapping, and performance optimization (e.g., Z-sorting geometry, considering array-based collision).

## Personal Insights
- Kaze is highly self-critical of his work, willing to make "big restructures" if he feels a course is "not very good."
- He has a clear vision for his target audience, aiming for "a weird nerd that's been playing Nintendo games in his basement for 25 years," contrasting it with games designed for broader, more casual audiences.
- Kaze holds strong opinions on game design, particularly disliking mechanics that involve waiting (common in some boss fights) and valuing player skill and freedom. He prefers games that offer "new concepts, new ideas."
- He expresses frustration with technical limitations or persistent issues (e.g., a specific compiler warning, emulator quirks) but is determined to fix them.
- He appreciates directness and utility in game mechanics, critiquing games like Portal 2 for being "too meta with the jokes" and a "cannibalization of Portal 1."

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub:** No direct mention of Badub or specific composer collaboration in this transcript. Kaze does ask for "OST wishes," indicating music is a consideration.
- **Biobak:** Mentioned as a graphics artist who will likely do a "reworking" of visual elements, potentially replacing Kaze's placeholder assets (like a fireplace model) with his own, more polished work. This suggests Biobak handles later-stage visual refinement.
    - Quote: "There's also a good chance that during the reworking, Biobank is just gonna remove this and put his own thing."
- **Zeina:** No direct mention of Zeina or specific animation contributions in this transcript. Kaze sarcastically remarks about characters T-posing, but this doesn't detail Zeina's role.
- **Other Contributors:**
    - **Lila (Chat):** Actively provides feedback, suggestions, and code/scripts that Kaze tests. Engages in technical discussions and playful banter. Kaze mentions a bug caused by something Lila wrote.
        - Quote: "The thing you wrote made the bug happen, where if you walk into a ceiling, you just clip into the ground. So I can't use that."
    - **KakiDev (Chat):** Offers technical suggestions, for instance, regarding compiler pragmas and optimizing collision data structures (from linked lists to arrays). Kaze values these ideas.
        - Quote: "yeah your idea sounds sensible khaki honestly maybe there should just be arrays formed when the level boots you know what I'll note that changed on that's a good idea"
    - **Frameperfection:** His patch is used for rounded wall collisions.
        - Quote: "Yes, wall collisions are rounded through frame perfection's patch."

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Major Level Restructure (Course 12):** An area was removed, and a train station element was repositioned to improve flow and introduce new gameplay.
- **New Gameplay Encounters:** A "Boshi" shootout cutscene is planned, involving a Wild West-style duel where the player must press B before Boshi.
- **Level Flow and Navigation:** A key concern is ensuring multiple paths and avoiding dead ends. Kaze actively seeks to improve how players navigate from one part of an area to another (e.g., "I feel like there needs to be a way to go from here to here").
- **Collectibles (Red Coins):** Finding creative and meaningful placements for all eight Red Coins in an area is a recurring design challenge. Red coins in this hack have special B-parameters allowing them to function across different sub-areas. Red coin stars are "bootless" (don't kick Mario out of the level).
- **Technical Challenges:**
    - A persistent compiler warning related to the `fp` register being "bound to multiple values" across different threads is a source of frustration.
    - Emulator compatibility and performance (e.g., Project 64 1.6 crashing, moving to an in-development "Project 64 Legacy").
    - Optimizing performance, such as Z-sorting geometry by naming meshes alphabetically for render order.
- **Visual Design:** Implementing lighting (e.g., using fireplaces as light sources in the mine), UV unwrapping complex geometry, and ensuring assets fit the N64 aesthetic.

## Business Aspects
- No explicit discussion of marketing, funding, or release/distribution plans for "Return to Yoshi's Island" itself.
- Kaze briefly considers the implications of making a public video about an "Ace Bug," weighing the educational benefit against the risk of misuse, which touches on public relations and community management.

## Key Quotes
- "Because I thought about it and I realized the course is not very good. And I think now it is good." (Reflecting his iterative design and commitment to quality)
- "But for like, a weird nerd that's been playing Nintendo games in his basement for 25 years, my game is definitely going to be way better." (Defining his target audience and ambition)
- "We first make the level design and then we make the visuals." (Insight into his development workflow)
- "I fixed all the compiler errors or all the warnings but this one I cannot fix... The issue is that the fp register is bound to multiple values... I don't think I can turn it off." (Highlighting a persistent technical challenge)

## Potential Interview Topics
- **The Iterative Design of Course 12:** Explore the decision-making process behind the "big restructures" in Course 12, including the removal of an area and the introduction of the Boshi shootout. What prompted these changes?
- **Collaborative Dynamics in a Streamed Development:** How does live streaming development impact collaboration with individuals like Lila, KakiDev, and asynchronously with artists like Biobak? How are feedback and contributions integrated?
- **Technical Deep Dive - The "fp register" Warning & Emulator Choices:** Discuss the nature of the persistent compiler warning and the broader challenges of working with the N64 architecture and emulators for a complex decompilation project.
- **Crafting the "Hardcore" Mario Experience:** Delve into Kaze's philosophy for designing a game that appeals to seasoned "nerd" players. What specific elements from classic 3D Mario games is he trying to recapture or evolve, and what does he consciously avoid?
- **Unique Mechanics and Creative Solutions:** Discuss the implementation of features like the cross-area Red Coins with B-parameters, "bootless" stars, and the planned minecart physics. How do these custom elements enhance the gameplay experience he's aiming for?
