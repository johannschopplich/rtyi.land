## Game Development Process
- The game "Return to Yoshi's Island" is actively in development, utilizing the Mario 64 decompilation.
- A significant portion of the stream focuses on a new "paper" or "craft" themed level, which Kaze states is in a "very early version," having been started about "a week or two ago."
- Current work involves level design (adjusting areas like the starting zone and castle, placing props), mechanic refinement (specifically the spin jump), asset creation (e.g., the Thimble Shy Guy), and planning for collectibles (Yoshi Coins).
- Kaze is shown iterating on level geometry, platforming elements, and NPC interactions within this craft-themed level.
- Performance on N64 hardware is a consideration, with Kaze noting polygon counts and testing builds on actual hardware.
- The development includes bug fixing (e.g., breakdance animation bug, pause/unpause bug).
- There's a plan for "15 main courses" for the overall game.

## Personal Insights
- Kaze expresses a desire for "less random and more purposeful" design in level layouts.
- He is self-critical of game mechanics, noting the spin jump was initially "way too strong" and "broken."
- Kaze values a specific "craft" aesthetic for the current level, pondering how to represent elements like water and enemies using paper or cardboard.
- He acknowledges community feedback, sometimes with surprise, as when noting positive reactions to the paper level after previous negative comments.
- Kaze has a clear rule against incorporating elements from Mario games released significantly after the N64 era, unless they are original creations for the hack. ("Um, no, we're not referencing anything Nintendo made up for like 1996 or after 2001, whenever the last N64 game released.")
- He shows dedication to solving design problems, spending considerable time on stream working through issues like the Thimble Shy Guy's appearance or the spin jump mechanics.
- Kaze mentions, "I have also taken notes that I think we have our first real hater... There's one person disliking every video I upload like two minutes after I upload it. So this is exciting."

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub:** Composer for the game. Kaze mentions, "Ideally I'm gonna have a music that changes depending on which biome of the level you're in... I'm gonna see what music Badoob is gonna come up."
- **Biobak:** Graphics artist. Kaze mentions Biobak swapped out some newer enemy pictures ("I'm pretty sure Biobank swapped those out") to align with the game's intended N64-era style. Also mentioned, "Biobank is almost done, I think," suggesting ongoing work.
- **Zeina:** Animator/Artist. Mentioned in relation to cloud assets: "Zeyna wants to draw in clouds anyway, so I'm attaching them right now." Also, when discussing the Shy Guy model: "Is it because 13? Zena is working on it right now. It's not finished." (It's unclear if "13" refers to a version or something else, or if "Zena" is the same as "Zeyna").
- **Other Contributors:**
    - **Layra:** A community member who provided a 3D model/suggestion for the Thimble Shy Guy and a cloud model that Kaze considered and decided to use. ("Let's see what this is, Layra... That cloud does look really nice... I think I'm going to switch over to these then.")
    - **Michi:** Kaze briefly mentions checking "Michi's art on here."
    - **Chat Members (general):** Kaze actively interacts with chat, taking suggestions and feedback. One user provided a cloud ".plant" file which Kaze adopted.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Spin Jump Mechanics:** A major focus was to make the spin jump "less oppressive" and not "way too broken." Kaze iterated on its height, control, and feel, aiming for something like Smash Bros. Down B, ultimately reducing its height gain but improving its air stall capabilities.
- **Yoshi Coin Placement:** Kaze wants to make Yoshi Coins engaging and "not boring," exploring ideas like trampolines, secret entrances (cardboard flaps), and interactions with NPCs/environments. He is keen to avoid placing them too obviously or in ways that don't feel rewarding.
- **Craft Aesthetic Implementation:** A recurring challenge is translating game elements into a convincing "craft" style. This includes:
    - **"Paper Water":** Discussed various ideas like tinsel or cellophane, acknowledging the difficulty of making it interactive.
    - **Enemy Design:** Rejected a "scissor enemy" as it's a tool, not a craft. Brainstormed ideas like "dust bunnies" and spent significant time designing a "Thimble Shy Guy," focusing on its material (metal, felt, cardboard, cup), shape, and texture to make it recognizable and thematic.
    - **Props:** Styrofoam, waxed cardboard, "penis hills," and cardboard cutout clouds are part of this aesthetic.
- **NPC Interactions:** Planning for NPCs made of paper/craft materials, such as a "Paper Peach" rescue mission involving Shy Guys, and interactions with existing "doodles" of Toad and Luigi.
- **Level Layout & Flow:** Kaze adjusted the starting area to be "more purposeful" and considered adding elements like a slide through a mountain. He also addressed performance concerns related to object density in central areas.
- **Technical Visuals:** Extensive discussion on achieving specific lighting effects (specular highlights, normal maps vs. bump maps) on N64 to enhance the craft material look. Kaze mentions developing a custom solution for reflections.
- **Movement System:** Beyond the spin jump, Kaze mentions that "Return to Yoshi's Island" features an enhanced M64 moveset with bug fixes and quality-of-life improvements (e.g., jumping after a long jump, consistent wall kick speed).

## Business Aspects
- **Release Model:** "Yes, it will release for free. I never charge for my games. I wouldn't be allowed to."
- **Source Code:** "Yes, the source will be public."
- **Hypothetical Monetization:** If allowed, Kaze mused, "Probably release the base game for free and then you could buy a skin or something."
- **Community Engagement:** The stream itself, interaction with chat, and calls to action ("Don't forget to like and subscribe!") serve as community building and informal marketing. Donations from viewers (e.g., "Saburo buy 1,500 bits") are acknowledged.

## Key Quotes
- "Another thing I really wanna work on today is figuring out a way to make the spin jump less oppressive on the whole game's design as a whole. I think the spin jump is cool, but it's way too strong." (Highlights a key design challenge and iterative process)
- "What I am thinking about, though, is more ways to put Yoshi coins in here that are not boring." (Shows concern for player experience and engaging collectibles)
- "Basically, the Yoshi coins are special interactions that we have in each level... this level doesn't have many NPCs that we can program interactions with. So we need to be creative and come up with things." (Defines the role of Yoshi Coins and the creative challenge)
- "Um, no, we're not referencing anything Nintendo made up for like 1996 or after 2001, whenever the last N64 game released." (States a core design philosophy regarding source material)
