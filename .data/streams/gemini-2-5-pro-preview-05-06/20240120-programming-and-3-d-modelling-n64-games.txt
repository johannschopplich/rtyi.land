## Game Development Process
- Kaze is actively working on the "saloon" level, including a secret room and an attached cave system intended for a minecart chase sequence.
- Significant progress includes importing most of the saloon level, implementing new dialogue cutscenes, and working on net physics.
- The "pirate ship" level is described as "mostly done," awaiting final animations and improved flame effects.
- Development involves iterative design, asset integration (Shy Guys, barrels, textures), and fixing technical issues (vertex shading, rendering bugs, missing textures).
- Kaze mentions starting development of "Return to Yoshi's Island" (RTYI) around mid-2020.
- Optimization is an ongoing concern, with work on the room system to reduce lag and efforts to manage polygon counts (e.g., "reduce so many condition vertices").

## Personal Insights
- Kaze has strong opinions on game monetization, preferring to release the game for free and open source, with potential "souvenir" sales (like an OST cartridge) over direct game sales.
- He is passionate about achieving a high level of polish, stating, "The background's gonna make this level go from like 9 out of 10 to 10 out of 10."
- Kaze is candid about external challenges, such as Nintendo taking down over 70 of his videos, which he feels has hindered his channel's growth.
- He often engages in philosophical or tangential discussions with his chat, covering topics from eternal life to critiques of consumerism and views on porn addiction.
- He values community interaction, taking suggestions from chat (e.g., camera ideas, dialogue lines) and discussing feedback.

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub (composer):** No specific contributions or interactions were mentioned in this transcript excerpt for "Return to Yoshi's Island."
- **Biobak (graphics artist):** Kaze discusses changes made to Shy Guy models, implying they were assets received from a collaborator ("Did I change anything from what you've sent? I changed the Shy Guys a little bit..."). A chatter named "Biobank" (highly likely to be Biobak) also actively contributes ideas during the stream, such as a pun-based dialogue line ("We do things the murky way" -> "milky way").
- **Zeina (animator):** Mentioned as being responsible for animations (e.g., "pirate ship is mostly done. I'm just missing a few jelly block animation frames" likely by Zeina) and was expected to provide 3D models, specifically "milk bottles" for the saloon level, though Kaze notes, "I guess she forgot."
- **Other Contributors:**
    - **LibDragon dev(s):** Kaze mentions occasionally talking to a developer from the LibDragon project about N64 optimizations and sharing ideas.
    - **James Lambert:** Mentioned for creating a "very cool technical thing" on N64 (Megatech), though not directly a contributor to RTYI.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Saloon Secret Room & Minecart Chase:** A significant portion of the stream focuses on designing a secret "choccy milk" speakeasy in the saloon, leading to a minecart chase sequence through an adjoining cave. This involves brainstorming:
    - The narrative hook (illegal choccy milk).
    - The trigger for the chase (Shy Guys getting caught and fleeing).
    - Mechanics of the chase (Mario jumping between 3 separate minecarts, dodging projectiles from Snuffits).
    - The level layout for the cave and minecart track.
    - How to end the sequence (discussion around a fall vs. reaching an end platform, with a decision leaning towards a fall and then a fight).
- **Player Experience & Control:** Kaze is concerned with ensuring intuitive gameplay and preventing exploits. For example, deciding that landing on minecart tracks (off the carts) should result in "death" to keep the chase focused. He also debates camera controls (current third-person vs. full first-person).
- **Technical Challenges:**
    - **Rendering issues:** Problems with vertex shading (carpet), lighting flags on textures (barrels), and general rendering bugs with Glideon (e.g., on the minecart rails).
    - **Asset integration:** Adjusting combiners on Shy Guy models due to environment color issues, finding suitable textures for the cave.
    - **Physics:** Implementing generic net physics.
- **Maintaining Mario Feel:** Kaze emphasizes keeping the gameplay platforming-based, stating, "I like it to still be platforming based is the thing. I don't really want to give Mario a gun."
- **Discoverability:** Designing hidden elements, like the secret saloon door, to be discoverable through NPC dialogue and environmental clues.

## Business Aspects
- The game "Return to Yoshi's Island" will be released for **free** and will be **open source**.
- Kaze has considered a potential monetization strategy: selling a physical version of the game's Original Soundtrack (OST) on a cartridge, complete with a box and instruction manual, marketed as a "souvenir."
- He explicitly states, "I actually think video games should not be monetized off of video game sales. I think that's a stupid concept."
- Kaze mentions that Nintendo has taken down over 70 of his videos, impacting his channel's visibility and perceived as "sabotage."

## Key Quotes
- "The background's gonna make this level go from like 9 out of 10 to 10 out of 10." (Illustrates dedication to polish)
- "I actually think video games should not be monetized off of video game sales... I think maybe you should sell souvenirs of your video games." (Highlights Kaze's philosophy on monetization)
- "So today what we have to do is we're gonna have to make the secret room in the saloon... We're gonna go through it and then we'll cut into a room where a bunch of cowboys are hanging out and they're secretly drinking choccy milk, which is illegal in this world." (Shows the creative, humorous, and narrative-driven design process)
- "I'm gonna make it so that if you land on the rails, you're just gonna die. That's literally it there's no argument about this." (Demonstrates decisive problem-solving to maintain intended gameplay flow)
