## Game Development Process
- The game "Return to Yoshi's Island" is planned to have 15 courses in total.
- Development is currently focused on Overworld 3, starting with Course 11, "Bowser's Frantic Fleet Factory."
- The Bowser fight logic is "basically finished" and awaiting animations from Zeina, as well as SFX and VFX implementation.
- Once the Bowser fight assets are integrated, the first two overworlds will be considered complete.
- Kaze is actively brainstorming and finalizing ideas for the remaining 5 main courses and 2 side levels.
- There's a specific plan to include 15 "retro levels" (pipes leading to sections themed after older games) throughout the game.
- Kaze demonstrated the game running well on N64 hardware, highlighting good performance even in widescreen mode.
- The stream itself is part of the development process, used for brainstorming level themes and mechanics with community input.

## Personal Insights
- Kaze Emanuar emphasizes the importance of strong decision-making in game development: "Making decisions is like the most important thing of making a game... if you don't make good decisions, your game's gonna be shit."
- He believes in generating a surplus of ideas to choose from: "You should come up with 15 ideas and use 5 of them... We need more ideas so we can pick the higher quality ones."
- Kaze is conscious of not repeating ideas from his previous ROM hacks like "Lost Impact" or concepts already well-executed in other notable hacks like "Star Road," aiming for originality or a fresh take.
- He has strong opinions on level themes, disliking water levels and "boring" concepts like museums, and preferring complex but understandable game mechanics.
- He expresses a desire to make games for the joy of creation and for people to play freely: "I don't want people do have to pay or watch ads for games. I just want to make good games."

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub (referred to as "Badoo"):** The composer for the game. Kaze mentions that organizing the planned "Music Level" with Badub will require effort but should work.
- **Biobak:** A graphics artist. Kaze mentions Biobak could potentially model a complex retro-futuristic level but is hesitant to ask for "200 hours of unpaid labor."
- **Zeina (referred to as "Zeno" and "Xena"):** The animator. Kaze is waiting for Zeina's animations for the Bowser fight before he can implement the final SFX and VFX for it. Her work is a key dependency for completing parts of Overworld 2.
- **Other Contributors:** No other specific, active contributors to "Return to Yoshi's Island" were explicitly named with defined roles in this transcript. Kaze mentions other modders ("Scallops") in the context of their past work.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Main Challenge:** Generating enough high-quality, original course ideas for the 5 remaining main level slots. Kaze wants more ideas than needed to ensure quality.
- **Iterative Design:** Kaze actively brainstorms, discusses, and refines level ideas during the stream, taking chat suggestions into account. He discarded several initial ideas and developed new ones.
- **Key Course Concepts Solidified:**
    - **Bowser's Frantic Fleet Factory (Course 11):** An airship factory where Mario sabotages operations. Detailed mission structure and environment ideas are laid out.
    - **Wild West Valley:** Yoshi Valley (from Mario Kart 64) themed as a Wild West level where Mario acts as a detective catching outlaws (Snuffits, Shy Guys).
    - **Superhero Comic Book World:** Mario as a superhero in a grim city, potentially with a "dark world" mechanic involving lower gravity in a Raven-controlled haunted version.
    - **Music Level:** Initially hesitant due to "Star Road," but reconsidered with new ideas, possibly involving Mario Paint aesthetics.
    - **Casino Level:** A theme Kaze enjoys and wants to do well, despite a previous iteration in "Lost Impact." Potentially oversized.
- **World-Switching Mechanic:** Kaze is keen on a level with a mechanic similar to Tiny-Huge Island, where players switch between two versions of the same world (e.g., normal/haunted, potentially using mirrors as a transition). This idea was explored for a medieval castle and then adapted for the superhero comic book level.
- **Retro Level Integration:** A significant design element involves creating 15 retro pipes leading to sections inspired by older games. The stream involved assigning specific games (e.g., Smash 64, Mario Land 1, Paper Mario, Yoshi's Story, Dr. Mario, Mario Paint) to the planned main courses.
- **Avoiding Repetition:** A recurring concern is to avoid themes or mechanics already heavily featured in his own past works or other popular ROM hacks unless he can offer a significantly fresh take.
- **Technical Considerations:** Brief discussion on frame pacing and NTSC-only development. Kaze is confident in the game's performance on N64.

## Business Aspects
- **Monetization Stance:** Kaze explicitly states he does not want to make players pay or watch ads for his games. He rejected the idea of a "Paypal level."
- **Streaming Platform Choice:** Kaze has switched from Twitch to YouTube for streaming, citing Twitch's revenue split ("they kind of like taken over 50% cut") and ad policies as reasons.
- **Marketing/Distribution:** No specific plans for marketing or formal release were discussed, beyond Kaze's general aim to make good games that many people play, suggesting ROM hacking is a better avenue for reach than indie games without strong marketing.
