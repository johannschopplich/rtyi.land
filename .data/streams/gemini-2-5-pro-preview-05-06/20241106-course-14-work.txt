## Game Development Process
- **Overall Progress:** Kaze is working on "Course 14," with specific areas like a pyramid and an 8-bit retro section being designed. Course 14 is stated to be "almost done," and "Course 15 is also already halfway done."
- **Major Milestones:** The goal is to "finish all the main content in 2025," after which there will be "a lot of time to polish the game." This suggests a phased approach: content creation followed by polishing.
- **Development Stages:**
    - Level Design: UV mapping an area, designing platforming, adjusting area size for camera, fixing bugs related to level objects (e.g., "bump" enemies).
    - Reworks: Several courses have been reworked (Course 1, 3, 4, 5, 11). Others like "Koopa Karnal" have not yet.
    - Asset Integration: Waiting for models like "cardboard Donkey Kong and cardboard peach from Yuki."
    - Retro Section Design: A significant portion of the stream involves brainstorming and designing a "Mario Paint" themed retro section for Course 14, including mechanics for drawing and color interaction.
- **Technical Infrastructure:** Discussion on instant warps requiring a collision map, which in turn needs the "first full level" to avoid wasted time. Mention of optimizer tools ("But rama is about to make such use of your optimizer").

## Personal Insights
- **On Game Design Philosophy:** Kaze expresses strong opinions on game design, e.g., criticizing GoldenEye's controls ("aiming with a stick fucking sucks"), and preferring meaningful platforming challenges over purely aesthetic ones for retro sections. He also values using underutilized game mechanics like "exclamation boxes."
- **On Project Scope/Ambition:** He acknowledges the difficulty of certain tasks (e.g., "minty level" for the ice castle is "fucking difficult") but is committed to a long-term vision for the game.
- **On Problem Solving:** The stream showcases his iterative thought process, openly discussing challenges, brainstorming solutions with the chat, and weighing different design options (e.g., for the retro section and pipe placement).
- **On N64 Development:** He has a practical understanding of N64 limitations, such as audio quality ("we are already using the maximum that the n6 was capable of quality wise") and memory management (explaining why ROM hacks often used the expansion pack).
- **Humor and Personality:** Kaze's personality comes through with jokes (e.g., "I just made me involuntarily learn French I Will not forgive you Biobak"), personal anecdotes, and direct interaction with his audience.

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub (composer):**
    - While Badub isn't explicitly named in this transcript, Kaze asks, "Do we have any OST pics for the day?" indicating music selection is an ongoing process.
    - He mentions, "We do use some stream music which sounds a lot higher quality But it eats up a lot of room space," highlighting a technical consideration related to music in the game.
- **Biobak (graphics artist):**
    - Kaze mentions sending a UV-mapped area to "Biobank" (likely Biobak) who "was gonna make the colors pretty and everything." This shows Biobak's role in the visual polish and texturing of levels.
    - A humorous interaction: "I See biomech You just made me involuntarily learn French I Will not forgive you".
- **Zeina (animations):**
    - The transcript mentions Zeina in the context of level design for the ice castle: "ice castle's not done either though there's still the outside area that zena wanted to work on."
    - No specific mention of animation work by Zeina for "Return to Yoshi's Island" in this particular transcript.
- **Other Contributors:**
    - **Yuki:** Kaze is "Still waiting for the cardboard Donkey Kong and cardboard peach from Yuki," indicating Yuki provides 3D models for the game.
    - **"Mario 64 GBA guy":** Kaze "scripted a banger video with the Mario 64 GBA guy," a collaboration on content separate from, but related to, the M64 modding scene.
    - **But_rama:** Mentioned in the context of an optimizer tool: "But rama is about to make such use of your optimizer." This suggests But_rama developed a tool Kaze finds useful for the project.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Level Design & Mechanics:**
    - **Area Adjustments:** An area was made "a little bit bigger... for the sake of the camera."
    - **Skip Removal:** Removed a "triple jump thing" and a "ground pound jump skip" to ensure intended level flow or difficulty.
    - **Enemy Behavior:** Fixing issues with "bump" enemies snapping back.
    - **Retro Section - Mario Paint:** Extensive discussion on designing this section. Initial ideas involved a 3D music scene, then a canvas where the player draws. The final concept involves:
        - Walking into a canvas to get colors (red, black, white, blue, beige, green, yellow, purple).
        - An outline of Mario's face will be provided.
        - Player walks to leave paint trails.
        - Ground pound to fill larger spots.
        - A detection algorithm to check if Mario is drawn "close enough" to award a star.
        - Specific canvas size considered: 124x124 RGBA32.
    - **Retro Section - Alternatives Considered:** Dr. Mario (falling blocks), Paper Mario (visuals fit but release date concern), Mario's Missing (rejected), Hotel Mario (rejected).
    - **Pipe Placement:** Deliberating the best location for a pipe leading to the 8-bit section in the pyramid level, considering visibility, difficulty, and player experience.
    - **Exclamation Boxes:** Kaze feels they are "very much underutilized... in this game" and wants to use them more.
- **Technical Challenges:**
    - **N64 Expansion Pack:** Kaze clarifies that most ROM hacks requiring it was due to "older tools" and "lazy" memory management, not an inherent need for the pack itself.
    - **Audio Quality vs. ROM Space:** Higher quality streamed music "eats up a lot of room space."
    - **Collision Maps & Warps:** Needing a "first full level" to efficiently create collision maps for instant warps.
    - **Polygon Count:** Considering if pencil spikes would be "too many polygons" (concludes they are fine).
- **Naming Conventions:** Brainstorming names for the ice castle level, settling on "Forgotten Fortress" after considering various options like "Polar Peak," "Mysterious Minty Manor," and "Desolate Fortress."

## Business Aspects
- **Sponsored Content (Kaze's Streaming):** Kaze mentions a sponsored stream opportunity: "I got an email today and that said that I'd play roblox for two hours they will pay me $135... So expected to our roblox stream sometime this week." He also mentions a bonus for in-game spending. This is related to Kaze's income as a streamer, not directly funding "Return to Yoshi's Island."
- **No other direct mentions of marketing, specific funding for "Return to Yoshi's Island," or detailed release/distribution plans beyond the 2025 content completion goal.**

## Key Quotes
- "So I'm mostly finished UV mapping this area here And I have some decent platforming everywhere I'm pretty happy with how this looks I mean, obviously this isn't gonna be the final look But this is what we're gonna send off to Biobank And he was gonna make the colors pretty and everything." (Shows collaboration and development stage)
- "I feel like we're definitely gonna finish all the main content in 2025 and then we have a lot of time to polish the game." (Indicates project timeline and scope)
- "Okay but imagine we have this layout here, with these colors, and then we have like dotted lines for the instruments, and you have to jump between notes, and whenever you land on a note, it makes a sound... Maybe Mario Paint just sucks as a retro section... Okay, I think our plot is solid [for the Mario Paint drawing minigame]. We just need to make Mario's face now." (Illustrates the iterative design process and problem-solving for a specific game feature)
