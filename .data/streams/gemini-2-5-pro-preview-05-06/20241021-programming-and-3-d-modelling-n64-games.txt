## Game Development Process
-   Currently working on "Force 14," a specific level or area in the game.
-   Focus on implementing and refining core gameplay mechanics, such as a new crayon drawing feature and "paper springs" for platforming.
-   Significant effort is being put into level design and iteration, including completely redoing sections like the "Styrofoam mountains" (planned snow biome) and the "Star of the Mountains" area to improve their quality and gameplay flow.
-   Experimentation with visual elements, such as texture filtering and HUD design, to achieve the desired aesthetic.
-   Development involves creating general-purpose functions for game objects to streamline programming (e.g., for sliding mechanics).
-   The process is highly iterative, with Kaze frequently expressing dissatisfaction with current states and a desire to rework elements until they meet his vision (e.g., "I want to redo them," "This is still not great because there's like zero creativity involved").

## Personal Insights
-   Kaze values improving upon existing concepts rather than making arbitrary changes: "We don't want to make arbitrary changes like that to something that's global across the game. When we make a change like that, we want it to be like the same thing, but improved."
-   He has a distinct vision for level design, aiming for unconventional and surprising experiences: "You kind of just need to be schizophrenic and make connections that don't actually exist in your levels to maximize on that concept." This is inspired by his re-evaluation of levels like Hazy Maze Cave from SM64.
-   Player accessibility and enjoyment are key concerns: "Someone once told me that games being difficult is like an accessibility issue. And I can kind of see that. Dude, I don't think difficulty is essential to having fun in this game."
-   He expresses strong enthusiasm for the game's unique crafty aesthetic: "And it looks like a crayon drawing. I love this."
-   Kaze openly discusses frustrations with specific development tasks, such as modeling complex geometry for the paper springs: "I still can't figure out the geometry of this thing. This is complicated."

## Collaborator Information
-   **Badub (composer)**: No specific contributions or mentions in this transcript.
-   **Biobak (graphics artist)**: The transcript mentions "Biobank" being thanked, potentially for a donation and providing feedback on the HUD's blurriness. It's unclear if "Biobank" is the same individual as "Biobak." "Also someone said the HUD looks bad, but they wouldn't tell me why. They said something about it being blurry, but I don't agree that it's blurry."
-   **Zeina (animations)**: Mentioned in a personal context (arranging a birthday cake, making chocolate milk for Kaze). No specific game development contributions from her are detailed in this transcript segment.
-   **Other Contributors**:
    *   **Vizzy, Finity**: Provided feedback or agreement on texture filtering attempts.
    *   **IL (chat user)**: Suggested Kaze try making a paper spring himself to understand its geometry.
    *   **Shadwick, Mario Mike (chat users)**: Offered suggestions for the star select screen design.
    *   Various chat members (Mario, Luigi, SM64, Alex Bubu, Lila, Xaraclom, Fierce Deity Layra, Loud Strife, Tea Time, Poaching30, Joseph, Gray Rose, Dashboard, Ice Place) interacted, offered feedback, subscribed, or donated, contributing to the stream environment and sometimes influencing small decisions (e.g., song choice, crayon color idea).

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
-   **Crayon Drawing Mechanic**: A new feature allowing players to draw with a crayon/marker. Drawing on a star object grants the player a star. An idea to change the crayon's color (e.g., to blue) after specific interactions was noted.
-   **Paper Springs**: Introducing a new platforming element. Challenges included accurately modeling the 3D geometry of a folded paper spring ("This is deceptively a lot more complicated than it looks") and tuning its physics to be predictable and fun for the player, rather than strictly realistic.
-   **Level Redesign and Thematic Cohesion**: Redoing the "Styrofoam mountains" into a snow biome. A key challenge is designing the quest to retrieve Luigi's lost crayon to feel like a "journey" with meaningful obstacles and progression, rather than a simple fetch quest. This involves brainstorming mechanics like breakable blocks, buttons opening paths, or using the crayon to reveal elements.
-   **"Schizophrenic" Level Design Philosophy**: A deliberate choice to incorporate "random shit" and "make connections that don't exist" in level design to create surprising and memorable player experiences, inspired by elements like Dory in Hazy Maze Cave.
-   **Difficulty and Player Experience**: Actively working to avoid overly difficult or "jank" platforming sections. For instance, adjusting a challenging jump in the "Force 14" red coin area to be more manageable ("We gotta make it easier somehow"). The goal is an accessible game where difficulty can be self-imposed by players.
-   **HUD and Visuals**: Experimenting with texture filtering for the HUD and game world, ultimately deciding against filtering for the HUD to maintain clarity and improve upon the original SM64 HUD.
-   **Discoverability of Secrets/Entrances**: Rethinking the placement of the "bit pipe" entrance to make it more noticeable and considering new mechanics for accessing it, such as drawing invisible platforms with the crayon.

## Business Aspects
-   Kaze humorously discusses unconventional marketing ideas: "What if I start marketing myself like either a rapper or one of those comedians that keep talking about how they're going to get canceled?" and "I could like go to prison for like two years for copyright infringement and then like come out and be like my game is so good."
-   He dismisses the idea of "selling out" to specific demographics, suggesting the potential audience isn't large enough to justify it.
-   He views interactions like tweeting at Nintendo for rights as jokes, not serious legal or business strategies, understanding that large companies make calculated decisions.

## Key Quotes
-   "Look, I added a cool pastel crayon... You can draw with a marker. Isn't this amazing? ... And if you color the star, you get a star. How cool is that? And it looks like a crayon drawing. I love this." (Describing a core new mechanic and aesthetic element.)
-   "So the Styrofoam mountains, I have decided they're terrible. And I want to redo them... Because we want this to be kind of like the snow biome. Where Luigi loses his crayon. And then we want it to be kind of like a challenge to bring it back." (Illustrating iterative design and linking level theme to a gameplay objective.)
-   "You kind of just need to be schizophrenic and make connections that don't actually exist in your levels to maximize on that concept... Just do the most random shit imaginable. Make connections that don't exist." (Articulating a core, unconventional level design philosophy.)

## Potential Interview Topics
-   Explore the origins and evolution of the "pastel crayon" / craft aesthetic for "Return to Yoshi's Island" and how it influences gameplay mechanics beyond visuals.
-   Discuss Kaze's philosophy of "schizophrenic level design" in more depth: how does he balance randomness with cohesive gameplay, and what are his inspirations for these unexpected connections?
-   Delve into the challenges and decision-making process behind making the game accessible while still offering depth, particularly his views on difficulty as an "accessibility issue" versus self-imposed challenges.
-   Ask about the process of taking abstract ideas from the community (like the crayon turning blue or HUD feedback) and integrating them technically and creatively into the game.
-   Inquire about the narrative concept of Luigi losing his crayon and the design goals for making its retrieval a "journey." How does he plan to implement mechanics (like drawing to reveal paths) to support this?
