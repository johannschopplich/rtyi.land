## Game Development Process
-   **Overall Progress**: The game is in an advanced stage of development. Kaze mentions "120 stars are finished now, but then we want 20 more stars." He also states, "Currently we have 12 levels done."
-   **Major Milestones**: Completion of entire areas off-stream ("Yeah, I guess I finished the whole area of stream and then also did the next area.") signifies substantial progress. The focus is shifting to remaining stars, overworld elements, and refining existing content.
-   **Development Stages**: The stream showcases work on a specific "cowboy" themed level, including NPC creation (Shy Guys, Monty Moles), asset refinement (textures, models, lighting), level layout, and narrative/mission brainstorming. Ripping and reworking assets from the original Mario 64 (e.g., Monty Mole) is also part of the process. Optimization for real N64 hardware is a continuous effort.

## Personal Insights
-   **Work Ethic**: Kaze describes himself as highly productive, humorously stating he avoids burnout because "I do not have a soul."
-   **Creative Motivation**: A strong desire "to tell stories in this game" is a key driver. He expresses satisfaction with his improved skills, noting, "I feel like recently I have a leveled up a lot of my skills and this level is like the first one that Has those applied and I'm pretty happy with it. It's very thematic everything is purposeful and I like that a lot."
-   **Game Design Philosophy**: Kaze values thematic consistency and purposeful design. He has strong opinions on technical aspects like FPS (preferring higher rates) and the importance of good controls. He also revises ideas if they feel "too dark" for a Mario game (e.g., the "Yoshi slave labor plot").

## Collaborator Information
-   **Badub (composer)**: No relevant information found in this transcript.
-   **Biobak (graphics artist/modeler)**:
    -   Contributes 3D models, such as a "new mouse model" and a "head for the Yoshis."
    -   Kaze reviews and provides technical feedback on Biobak's assets, such as a pipe model ("Opinion on the pipe. Alright, let me look... No, no, no, we have to have lighting on...").
    -   Also referred to as "Biomech" and "Biobank" in the transcript.
-   **Zeina (animator/modeler)**:
    -   Creates 3D models, credited with making "the dragon" and manually creating rock assets ("Zena made those manually by hand").
    -   Also contributes character models, such as for Goombas ("Alright, Zeyna's also making a Goomba.").
    -   Also referred to as "Zeno" in the transcript.
-   **Other Contributors**:
    -   **Silas**: Mentioned for working on game mechanics: "Silas said he wanted to rework the squishiness function. He said he had a cool idea."
    -   **Leela (Kaze's wife)**: An active participant in the stream chat, providing commentary and engaging in banter with Kaze. While not a formal developer, her interactions are part of the stream's dynamic.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
-   **Level Theming and Narrative**: The cowboy level is designed with distinct areas (town, wilderness, train station) and specific narrative beats (treasure hunt, train robbery by Goombas, Monty Mole bank robbery). Kaze aims for levels where "everything is purposeful."
-   **NPC Design**: Creating themed NPCs (e.g., Cowboy Shy Guys, Toads, Monty Moles) with appropriate attire (cowboy hats, boots, vests) is a focus. This involves reusing and modifying existing models, as well as creating new assets.
-   **Technical Challenges**:
    -   Performance: "This level is running pretty well in 64. It's like almost 60 FPS." Optimization for real N64 hardware is a priority over emulators.
    -   Visuals/Geometry: Issues like "triangle overflow" are mentioned as sources of bugs. Lighting and material setup (e.g., for Shy Guys) require careful adjustment.
    -   Asset Integration: Deciding whether to use contributed assets (e.g., Zeyna's Goomba) and how to best fit them into the level.
-   **Iterative Design**: Level names are brainstormed and debated ("High Noon Hills," "Grandstand Badlands"). Asset designs, like the Shy Guy's vest, go through multiple iterations. Kaze mentions adjusting plot points: "the whole Yoshi slave labor plot is maybe a bit too dark... plot in Mario games is kind of very secondary."
-   **Gameplay Elements**: Designing specific boss fights (e.g., Goomba shootout, Monty Mole boss) and mission structures ("solve three secrets that will each give you a star").

## Business Aspects
-   **Streaming Strategy**: Kaze mentions streaming on both Twitch and YouTube simultaneously: "Because Twitch changed the rules recently, so now you're allowed to stream on both at the same time." This indicates an effort to maximize audience reach.
-   **IP Awareness**: He shows an awareness of Nintendo's stance on fan projects, joking about how quickly a "roaming Academy" (ROM hacking academy) would be shut down.
-   **Funding/Release**: No direct mentions of specific funding for this ROM hack or concrete release plans beyond continued development. ROM hacks are typically passion projects not sold commercially.

## Key Quotes
-   "I want to tell stories in this game." (Highlights a core creative drive for the project.)
-   "Yeah, of course this runs on real hardware. What do you think I do all the optimization for, for emulator?" (Emphasizes his commitment to N64 authenticity and performance.)
-   "I feel like recently I have a leveled up a lot of my skills and this level is like the first one that Has those applied and I'm pretty happy with it. It's very thematic everything is purposeful and I like that a lot." (Shows personal growth and pride in the quality of his current work.)

## Potential Interview Topics
-   **The Philosophy of ROM Hacking as Game Creation**: Explore Kaze's perspective on using the SM64 decompilation as a foundation for creating an entirely new game experience like "Return to Yoshi's Island."
-   **Balancing Nostalgia and Innovation**: How does he approach designing new content that feels fresh yet respectful of the original Mario 64 framework and Mario universe?
-   **The Collaborative Ecosystem in ROM Hacking**: Delve deeper into how collaborations with artists like Zeyna and Biobak, and programmers like Silas, function. How are tasks distributed, feedback exchanged, and creative visions aligned for a passion project?
-   **Storytelling in Platformers**: Discuss Kaze's methods and goals for "telling stories" within the constraints and conventions of a Mario-style platformer, particularly for the cowboy level's outlaw-focused narrative.
-   **Navigating Technical Constraints and Creative Ambition**: How does he manage ambitious design ideas (like multiple boss fights in one level, detailed environments) against the N64's technical limitations and his own optimization goals?
