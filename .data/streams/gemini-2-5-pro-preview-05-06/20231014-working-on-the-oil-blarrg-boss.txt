## Game Development Process
- The development is highly iterative, with Kaze primarily working on implementing and refining visual elements for Star Select screens (e.g., "Koopa Wave Cove," "Mouse Cave," "Bubble Dome") based on assets provided by collaborators.
- Significant progress is being made on these Star Select screens, involving animation, visual effects (fog, lighting, scrolling textures), and UI adjustments.
- A major milestone mentioned is the optimization of ROM space by 1.7 MB due to a tool from collaborator Arctic, allowing for more streamed music.
- Bug fixing is a continuous process, addressing issues like objects falling through floors, rendering errors, and animation glitches.
- Kaze often works through technical challenges live, such as N64 coordinate limitations forcing design changes (e.g., shortening a level element to prevent crashes).
- The order of asset creation and thus implementation can be driven by collaborator (Biobak's) preference: "it's basically just whatever biobank feels like making first gets made first."

## Personal Insights
- Kaze expresses a strong appreciation for high-quality art and music in games but believes game design is paramount (e.g., his opinion on Origami King: "the artists are so great the music is so great it's a shame that the game designers on this game are trash").
- He has a design philosophy of aiming for elegance and avoiding visual clutter, particularly in backgrounds: "We don't want the background to be too distracting... it kinda ruins the elegance of the background."
- Kaze is aware of his on-stream persona, acknowledging he can be "very easily irritated" but also quickly moves on.
- He shows a clear passion for N64 development, often diving into technical specifics and striving to push the console's capabilities.
- There's a recurring theme of wanting to create high-quality, polished experiences, evident in the detailed work on Star Select screens.

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub (Composer):** While not directly interacting in this stream, the successful ROM space optimization by Arctic is noted to allow for "more streamed music," which is Badub's domain. Kaze also mentions a plan to "buy the music and like pay the musician off," indicating an intent to compensate the composer.
- **Biobak (Graphics Artist):** Biobak is a key and active collaborator during the stream, providing 3D models, concepts, and feedback for various Star Select screens (Koopa Wave Cove, Mouse Cave, Koopa Carnival, Bubble Dome). Kaze spends much of the stream implementing and troubleshooting Biobak's assets (e.g., "Biobank modeled this at an insane scale," "Biobank feels like making first gets made first"). Biobak also suggests features and provides feedback live in chat (e.g., "move the text down," minecart animation).
- **Zeina (Animations):** Kaze mentions a future technical improvement: "as soon as we switch to Katerinian animations it's gonna be a lot less relevant." This suggests quaternion animations are planned, which would likely involve Zeina's expertise, though no direct contribution from Zeina is detailed in this specific stream.
- **Other Contributors:**
    - **Arctic:** A significant technical contributor. Arctic's tool "strm64" saved 1.7MB of ROM space, enabling more music. Kaze also consults Arctic's potential changes regarding music loop points ("did arctic remove the loop points").

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **N64 Hardware Limitations:** A recurring challenge. For example, the N64's 30,000-33,000 coordinate range limit forces Kaze to redesign elements to prevent crashes ("If you render any object out of this range your n64 is just gonna crash"). Performance and ROM size are constant considerations.
- **Implementing Visuals & Animations:** Significant effort goes into creating dynamic and visually appealing Star Select screens. This involves challenges like getting text scrolling right, implementing fog effects effectively, animating objects along splines (minecart), and ensuring smooth performance.
- **Bug Fixing:** Kaze encounters and resolves various bugs, from Mario falling through platforms ("Mario just falls through these and just dies") to rendering glitches and animation issues.
- **Design Philosophy:** Decisions are made to maintain visual clarity and elegance, such as avoiding overly cluttered backgrounds ("We don't want the background to be too distracting").
- **Scope Management:** Kaze mentions an idea for a "small sequel minigame to the yoshi racing simulator" but decides against it as it "doesn't fit the scope of this game."

## Business Aspects
- **Funding and Compensation:** Kaze is transparent about the limited profitability of his YouTube channel and Patreon ("My YouTube as it is, is already barely even profitable... $6.90 last month"). This impacts his ability to pay collaborators, though he expresses a desire to do so, especially for music ("That would like buy the music and like pay the musician off"). Biobak's payment is humorously mentioned as "$5 per vertex, which I can't afford."
- **Marketing/Promotion:** Primarily informal, through Kaze's YouTube streams and videos. He mentions an upcoming "banger video" that he hopes will "make the bucks," possibly for increased visibility or income.
- **Release/Distribution:** No specific plans for release or formal distribution are discussed in this transcript. The focus is on ongoing development.

## Key Quotes
- "Arctic realized yesterday that his tool strm64 has some cool properties that allow us to save 1.7 megabytes of ROM space... which means we are allowed to have more streamed music than we thought." (Highlights a significant technical breakthrough and collaborator impact)
- "We don't want the background to be too distracting I think that there's a very tempting force to just add more and more shit Until it's just a clusterfuck of stuff, but it kinda ruins the elegance of the background." (Reveals Kaze's design philosophy)
- "If you render any object out of this range your n64 is just gonna crash I will have to bring the fog nearer But you're going beyond this it's just a crash." (Illustrates a concrete N64 limitation dictating design)
