## Game Development Process
- **Overall Progress:** The game is significantly into development. Kaze mentions being on "course 13 right now" and states, "We are currently like 120 stars done and we're working on the overworld and the enemies. So it's getting pretty close. We have probably around 30% of the enemies in now."
- **Content Creation:** A substantial amount of content is complete or in progress, including "98 songs in the game."
- **Current Focus (during stream):** Designing the boss fight for Raphael the Raven, including the arena, mechanics, and visual set-piece. Importing and looping music for Course 13 (Ice Castle/Dungeon).
- **Development Stages:** Kaze describes a typical workflow: "Surely you know that the levels always look like shit at the beginning and then look better at the end." This indicates an iterative process from rough concept to polished level.
- **Tooling:** Uses Blender with a Python script called Fast64 for modeling and level geometry. Sac64 is used for the M64 MIDI-like music format.

## Personal Insights
- **Design Philosophy (Mario 64):** "Mario 64 is about freedom and exploration. Being directed to that heavily would, I think, ruin a lot of it."
- **Design Philosophy (Bosses):** "But it being a cool set-piece is my number one priority for bosses, always."
- **Iterative Process:** "Surely you know that the levels always look like shit at the beginning and then look better at the end." He embraces that initial versions might not be perfect.
- **On Community Perception:** "A lot of people seem surprised that the level actually looks good now. Apparently, everyone thought that level is going to be complete ass. And I don't know. I don't know why you don't have confidence in me by now."
- **On Releasing Games:** "I can't release it before it's finished, unfortunately. Because then I would release an unfinished product. The thing that everybody hates EA for."
- **On Objectives:** "The fun is to control Mario itself. Whereas in this, it's like the objective itself, like exploring what the objective is, is part of the fun."

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub (Composer):**
    - Highly praised by Kaze: "Badoub's music is great. The creativity he brings to the table is very, very sick."
    - Contributes significantly to the game's OST.
- **Biobak (Graphics/Concept Artist):**
    - Provided a video concept for the Raphael the Raven boss fight: "Let me just see if I can find the video that bio back had sent me here a while ago... This is what he was thinking. That's so cool."
- **Zeina (Animations):**
    - Mentioned in the context of animation work, with Kaze stating, "Of course, Zeyna has a lot more work with it than I do," implying a significant animation workload, possibly related to a "baby" character mentioned by chat.
- **Other Contributors:**
    - **Arthur:** Kaze mentions, "I'm going to ask Arthur for his planetary gravity code because he already knows what to do, I think," suggesting Arthur is a programmer with expertise in specific mechanics.
    - **Orion:** Mentioned in relation to past help with importing stream sounds: "This is from that time. I became friends with Orion."
    - **Dot Star Mony (also referred to as "star money"):** Composed music for Kaze's past mods (e.g., "Colossal Circuits") and apparently developed tools for music conversion. "Well, eventually Dot Star Money wrote his own tool to convert the songs and those songs turned out insane."
    - **Yellow or Jesse:** Mentioned as the creator of a "beach demo."
    - **Pablo:** Kaze speculates, "Did Pablo make this import?" regarding a texture, suggesting Pablo might be involved in asset porting.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Raphael the Raven Boss Fight Design:**
    - Extensive brainstorming during the stream, considering multiple phases, mechanics (falling into the sky, dodging stars, landing on a moon, enemy attacks, damaging the boss with "frozen cheese ninja stars").
    - Technical constraint: "That we need to make sure that the things we add can be done entirely on an actor level. And to do the hollow moon properly, we would need to make a change to how gravity works like universally, which I don't want." This led to focusing on an "outside the moon" fight.
    - Visuals: "So him blocking the moon in the intro cutscene, that's a given. We 100% want that."
- **Camera System:**
    - Acknowledged issues: "I think we have a few issues with poopy camera in here." "Well, okay, the camera definitely can't clip through the wall there. That's going to ruin the whole thing."
    - Challenges with implementing analog camera: "Okay, well, how am I supposed to add analog camera to this? Considering we only have one analog stick. There's a little bit of an issue here. On the feasibility side."
- **Music Implementation:**
    - Uses a MIDI-like format (M64 via Sac64) for 80-90% of the OST and streamed music for the rest.
    - Detailed process of finding loop points for a streamed track ("Ice Tunnel song") and calculating sample numbers for looping in-game.
- **Fog System Bugs:** "Yeah, there's a Fast64 bug that makes Geomode's fog always on. Even though it shouldn't be. It happens when you use material bleeding, unfortunately."
- **Star/Collectible Pacing:** Discussion about how to handle collectibles like Yoshi coins and 100-coin stars, preferring systems that don't force players to recollect everything if they exit a level, potentially drawing inspiration from Banjo-Kazooie notes.
- **Scope and Content Comparison:** "There's going to be like, I think, 180 stars on top of that [75 Yoshi coins]. So I guess content-wise, it's probably going to be pretty comparable to, or maybe more [than Odyssey], I don't know, hard to say."

## Business Aspects
- **Release Strategy:** "I can't release it before it's finished, unfortunately." "Nope, I don't have an S-word [release date] for the game coming out. I'll just finish the game at my pace and then it's going to come out."
- **Funding/Marketing:** No explicit mention of funding sources or dedicated marketing plans, which is typical for ROM hacking projects. The stream itself serves as a form of community engagement and progress showcase.
- **Demo Plans:** "I'm still thinking of doing a demo is just Chris one [Course 1]."
