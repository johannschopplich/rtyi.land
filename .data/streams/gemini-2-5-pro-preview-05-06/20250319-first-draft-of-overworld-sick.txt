## Game Development Process
- **Overall Progress:** The game is in a phase where all 12 main courses are structurally complete, but significant work is ongoing for level reworks (primarily by Biobank) and overworld development. Kaze is currently focused on "part four of the overworld."
- **Development Stages/Philosophy:**
    -   Iterative design: Visuals and polish are secondary to gameplay functionality in early stages ("it looks like dark shit because we don't do the visuals until it's done because we still make a lot of changes").
    -   Hub world development is considered best done "in post" when all other game information is available.
    -   The overworld is planned to be extensive, with the current focus being on 4 out of an anticipated 15 parts.
- **Milestones:**
    -   Fixing critical bugs (end screen transition, render bug).
    -   Conceptualizing and implementing the overworld structure, aiming for a seamless experience connecting different parts.
    -   Redesigning the game's hub.

## Personal Insights
- Kaze is open about his personal state affecting his work (e.g., being sick).
- He expresses a desire to create specific emotional impacts on the player, such as the "cool experience" of reaching the lighthouse after a long journey.
- He is not feeling "hard-pressed to release this as soon as possible," indicating a focus on quality over speed.
- He has a self-deprecating sense of humor regarding the early, unpolished visuals of the game ("it's supposed to look like dog shit").
- He reflects on his creative process, such as the "suspense treadmill" concept to maintain player engagement.

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub (Composer):**
    -   While Badub is not mentioned by name in this transcript, Kaze discusses the game's OST, including selecting music for the stream ("we need an OST for today") and a desire for a "physical cartridge release of the game's OST."
- **Biobak (Graphics Artist / Level Designer):**
    -   Plays a significant role in "level reworks" ("it's mostly Biobank doing them I think he's almost done with course 2 now").
    -   Actively participates in design discussions, as seen when Kaze addresses him directly about fast travel ideas ("Okay, Biobank, if you don't want pipes as fast travel, what would you like?").
    -   Is working on reworks for many of the "12 main courses" that are already done.
- **Zeina (Animations):**
    -   Mentioned in a humorous, non-work-related context regarding a heater issue ("it was Zena all along").
    -   Her specific contributions to "Return to Yoshi's Island" animations are not detailed in this transcript.
- **Other Contributors:**
    -   **Sauron (Soren):** Kaze discusses "important stuff" with him, specifically "his animation compression idea right now, that might save a little bit of performance."
    -   **Rionu:** Another modder whose work Kaze respects and sometimes emulates ("I'm copying whatever Rionu does. Since Rionu made the Vauri operation, I have to copy the Vauri operation").
    -   **Doriel:** Mentioned in an anecdote about ladder programming, suggesting she is part of the broader development/modding community.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Overworld Design:**
    -   **Seamlessness:** A major goal is to make the overworld transition seamlessly between areas without explicit warps ("Alright fine we'll make it seamless"). This presents significant technical challenges related to memory, loading times ("we don't have enough memory to just keep the old area loaded while loading a new one"), and engine limitations ("we can't render at all while loading in this engine").
    -   **Structure:** The overworld is designed to create a sense of discovery and return, e.g., seeing the lighthouse early on but only being able to reach it much later via a cave connection ("after you come out of the cave section you're gonna be here up top at the lighthouse... And I think that's gonna be a really cool experience").
    -   **Shortcut Mechanics:** Extensive discussion on how to create a permanent shortcut back up to the lighthouse (ideas include ropes, vines, breakable rocks, pipes, kickable platforms). The goal is a one-way unlockable path.
- **Hub World:** The old hub was unsatisfactory, leading to a "completely new one." Kaze believes hubs are best designed with full game context.
- **Fast Travel:** Various ideas are explored, from in-world elements like pipes and cannons to a UI-based system ("Imagine the pause menu here instead was a world map with a cursor... Man, that's tempting too. Should we do that? Yeah, that sounds so cool."). The world map idea seems to gain traction.
- **Loading Transitions:** If perfect seamlessness isn't achievable, Kaze considers alternatives like a "freeze frame, load the level, and unfreeze the frame" to mask loading.
- **Technical Limitations:** Constant struggle with SM64 engine limitations, memory ("I'm out of memory on my computer"), and performance, influencing design choices.

## Business Aspects
- **OST Release:** Kaze expresses a strong interest in a "physical cartridge release of the game's OST," believing it "would be the coolest shit ever."
- **Game Distribution:** He explicitly states he "can't release the game physically and I will actually get murdered," acknowledging the legal issues with selling a ROM hack.
- **Future Commercial Plans:** Kaze mentions, "Plus, hopefully I can make like a legally distinct version of this as well," hinting at potential future original projects inspired by or building upon this work.
- **Funding:** A viewer asks about donations, and Kaze's response ("it's legal to ask for donations for the game you couldn't") implies he is not soliciting donations for the game itself, though the phrasing is slightly ambiguous.

## Key Quotes
- "our mission today is to do part four of the overworld... And then after you come out of the cave section you're gonna be here up top at the lighthouse... And I think that's gonna be a really cool experience." (Explaining the player journey and design intent for the overworld)
- "Yes, the old hub sucked, I'm making a completely new one It's much better to decide on a hub in post than to do it while you're making the game The hub is the most important part, you need to make it with all the information available to you." (On hub design philosophy)
- "making this perfectly seamless actually doesn't work because of compression shit... we don't have enough memory to just keep the old area loaded while loading a new one... I'd have to make big changes that I'm not sure I'm willing to make." (Highlighting the technical challenges of the seamless overworld goal)

## Potential Interview Topics
- The detailed collaborative process with Biobank on level reworks and design: how are tasks divided, and how is creative vision shared and integrated?
- Exploration of the "legally distinct version": what aspects of "Return to Yoshi's Island" might carry over, and what are the broader ambitions for such a project?
- The decision-making journey for the seamless overworld: what were the key trade-offs considered between player experience, technical feasibility, and development time?
- Kaze's philosophy on player guidance and discovery, particularly relating to the "suspense treadmill" concept and the design of shortcuts and fast travel systems.
- How does Kaze manage community expectations and feedback while maintaining his creative vision for a large-scale fan project like this?
