## Game Development Process
-   **Overall Progress:** The stream focuses on a specific area: the Goomba boss fight, indicating iterative development and refinement of game sections. Kaze mentions numerous fixes done "off stream," suggesting continuous progress.
-   **Current Focus:** Primary tasks during this stream include fixing bugs with Spikey Goombas and the Goomba King, implementing and adjusting Goomba King animations, and working on the boss fight mechanics (boulder aiming, Goomba AI).
-   **Milestones:**
    -   Implementation of mipmaps ("Mipmaps. I did it.").
    -   Fixing N64-specific bugs related to lights and crashes.
    -   Near completion of the Goomba King's behavior and core animations, pending a "kick animation" and boss door integration.
    -   Experimentation with visual effects like bloom, though its performance cost is a concern.
-   **Development Stages:** The project appears to be in a stage of implementing core gameplay mechanics for specific levels/bosses, integrating assets from collaborators, and extensive bug fixing and polishing. There's also consideration for upcoming promotional content (YouTube videos).

## Personal Insights
-   **On Game Development:** Kaze views game development as an arduous process requiring extreme perseverance: "I keep saying this but if you want to be successful making video games you need to be mentally unwell... you're just gonna have to keep doing it." He emphasizes that fun is not the primary driver when facing difficult tasks.
-   **On Public Perception:** He is conscious of how his audience perceives his work, wanting to be recognized as a game developer rather than just a content creator making videos about Mario 64. "It's also like that people don't understand that I'm making a game. They think I'm just making videos."
-   **On His Project's Nature:** Kaze is clear that he is "making my own game," not just an optimized version of vanilla Mario 64. This is a key message he wants to convey to his audience.
-   **On Feedback:** He claims to "purposefully attract negative comments just to get feedback. And then I will use that feedback to improve my work," suggesting a pragmatic approach to criticism.

## Collaborator Information
-   **Badub (Composer):** No specific information found in this transcript regarding Badub's direct musical contributions to "Return to Yoshi's Island." An OST request was made for "Missing Link OST" during the stream, but this wasn't explicitly linked to Badub or RTYI.
-   **Biobank (Graphics Artist/Designer):**
    -   Contributes significantly to design and assets. Provided the "Goomba King model."
    -   Influences gameplay mechanics: "Biobank wanted to make a few changes to it [Goomba fight]. And I'm up for it."
    -   Provides ideas for video titles and marketing: "Biobank had great ideas [for video titles]."
    -   Expected to provide assets like "boss doors."
-   **Zayna (Animator):**
    -   Responsible for character animations. Kaze refers to Zayna's intentions for animations: "I feel like this is not what Zayna wanted [Goomba King animation]."
    -   Kaze compiles lists of needed animations for Zayna: "I'm going to write Zayna the animations we need."
-   **Other Contributors:**
    -   **Zell:** Working on "Missing Link version updates." Kaze states, "I'm just gonna pay him to do it," indicating Zell is a paid contractor for that related project.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
-   **Goomba Boss Fight Mechanics:**
    -   **Decision:** The fight involves the player luring the Goomba King to a specific spot and then aiming a boulder (pushed by other Goombas) at him. "You want the Goomba to pick a place. He just walks there. And then the boulder follows Mario. Not the other way around. So you have to aim the boulder at him."
    -   **Challenge:** Implementing the Goomba AI for positioning and boulder interaction, fixing bugs where Goombas get stuck or don't push the boulder correctly.
-   **Visual Enhancements vs. Performance:**
    -   **Decision/Experimentation:** Implemented mipmaps. Attempted a bloom effect.
    -   **Challenge:** The bloom effect is "really expensive," costing "7 milliseconds of RDP time," making it potentially unusable in main game areas but perhaps feasible in smaller, optimized sub-areas.
-   **Animation Implementation:**
    -   **Challenge:** Numerous issues with the Goomba King's animations, including incorrect leg poses ("Why does he have only one leg up?"), sideways orientation, eyes not closing, and bubble effects not syncing. "I don't like how this doesn't sync to the animation. Looks very poopy."
-   **Bug Fixing (General):**
    -   **Challenge:** Persistent visual bugs (Spikey Goomba "just kind of disappears for a bit," Goomba King "teleports up"), game crashes (traced to "animation seven"), and collision issues.
-   **N64 Compatibility:**
    -   **Challenge:** Ensuring features work correctly on N64 hardware, including fixing N64-specific light bugs. "I fixed a lot of N64 bugs this past 2 days."

## Business Aspects
-   **YouTube Strategy & Marketing:**
    -   Kaze plans specific YouTube videos to reveal "Return to Yoshi's Island" and clarify its nature as a new game: "...a video just gonna be titled like so about that N64 game I've been working on... Where I tell people, hey, my channel I'm not actually trying to make the optimized vanilla Mario 64. I'm making my own game."
    -   Considers video titling crucial for viewership, taking suggestions from Biobank for more clickbaity/engaging titles like "The secret reason I've been rewriting Mario 64."
    -   Aims to avoid being categorized as "YouTube slop" while still attracting a large audience.
-   **Resource Management:**
    -   Kaze mentions paying Zell for work on "Missing Link version updates," showing a willingness to invest financially in development aspects, though this isn't directly stated for RTYI itself.
-   **Release/Distribution:** No direct mentions of specific release plans, platforms (beyond N64 ROM hack implications), or pricing for "Return to Yoshi's Island" in this transcript.
