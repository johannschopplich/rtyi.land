## Game Development Process
- The stream focuses on the level design and asset creation for "Course 14," described as a "main level" with a cardboard crafts aesthetic.
- Key activities include mapping out level layouts, defining platforming paths to avoid linearity, and brainstorming ways to fill empty spaces thematically.
- Kaze is actively working on creating new assets like cardboard mushrooms (using toilet paper rolls and gift wrap), crayon platforms, and fences, focusing on a handmade look.
- Significant effort is put into optimizing for N64 hardware, managing polygon budgets, addressing overdraw issues, and improving rendering performance (e.g., saving instructions in the graph renderer).
- An iterative development approach is evident: ideas are proposed, modeled, tested (sometimes directly on N64 via Summer Cart), and refined or discarded based on gameplay feel, aesthetics, and technical feasibility.
- A public demo of "Course 1" is planned for release soon.

## Personal Insights
- Kaze identifies as "self-employed" and manages his work independently.
- He believes in the importance of making the craft materials in the game look "realistic to be convincing" to ensure players recognize and connect with the aesthetic (e.g., the shine on wrapping paper).
- He considers YouTube content strategy, thinking about making videos on basic Mario 64 topics to attract a wider audience, viewing it as "easy content to produce."
- Kaze often expresses his design philosophy directly, such as wanting to avoid overly linear levels and ensuring visual elements serve a gameplay or thematic purpose.
- His personality comes through with directness, humor, and occasional candid self-reflection.

- **Zeina (animations):** No specific contributions mentioned in this transcript.
- **Other Contributors:**
    - **UX links:** Provided a toilet paper roll texture via Discord, which Kaze then adapted.
    - **Wiseguy:** Kaze mentions finding improvements to "Wiseguy's MTXF shadow function," implying Wiseguy contributed code Kaze is using or building upon.
    - **Lila:** Mentioned in a somewhat joking manner regarding a high-poly model or error, and as a community member.
    - **Rocco:** A viewer who made a donation.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Aesthetic Consistency:** A primary goal is maintaining the "cardboard crafts" theme throughout the level. This involves selecting appropriate materials (cardboard, paper, crayons, toilet paper rolls, staples) and ensuring they look handmade.
- **Level Layout & Pathing:** A major focus is on designing non-linear levels with multiple paths. Kaze actively draws and re-evaluates paths to ensure varied gameplay options. For example, "This is very similar to the layout in peaches fury and that one was really not linear."
- **Filling Empty Space:** A recurring challenge is making large, flat cardboard areas engaging and visually interesting without breaking the theme or exceeding technical limits. "We're gonna have a problem that a lot of this is really big and empty and I'm not really sure how to make this less Flat and boring."
- **Asset Design & Detail:** Decisions are made about the specific construction of craft items, like whether a stapler needle is "too rough" for a paper mushroom or how to represent a flower cut-out simply.
- **N64 Performance Constraints:** Polygon counts, overdraw (RDP budget), and RSP performance are constant considerations that influence how detailed objects can be and how densely areas can be populated. "So we used around half of our polygon budget for the level. And we use more than half, more than our entire RDP budget, but the RDP budget is easy to fix."
- **Player Experience:** Consideration is given to jump difficulty and overall player challenge, aiming for fun but sometimes "evil" platforming sections.

## Business Aspects
- Kaze is "self-employed" and mentions taking on paid commissions separately from this project.
- He discusses plans to release a public demo of "Course 1," which serves as a form of early distribution and marketing for the game.
- He contemplates creating more general Mario 64 content for his YouTube channel to potentially increase viewership, stating, "I feel like that might do well on YouTube and that would be really good easy content to produce."
- Donations from viewers (e.g., Rocco's $11 donation) are acknowledged, indicating a potential supplementary income stream related to his streaming and development work.

## Key Quotes
- "Basically right now I'm thinking about how this will all work out in gameplay And I'm thinking about whether we need to move big elements so that we can fill in the gaps." (Illustrates his focus on gameplay-driven level design).
- "This is what I meant with the materials need to look realistic to be convincing Cause we all know wrap paper has a little bit of a shine to it So if it doesn't have to shine, people might not identify it as a wrap paper." (Highlights his design philosophy for the game's unique aesthetic).
- "We're gonna have a problem that a lot of this is really big and empty and I'm not really sure how to make this less Flat and boring, but it's all cardboard unless I like stack cardboard on cardboard." (Points to a core design challenge).

## Potential Interview Topics
