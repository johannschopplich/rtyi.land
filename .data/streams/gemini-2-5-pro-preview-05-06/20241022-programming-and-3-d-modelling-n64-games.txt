## Game Development Process
- Overall Progress: Actively developing specific levels (e.g., "Course 14" with snow/craft theme) and implementing mechanics (bridge, snowballs, confetti). Work includes refining existing systems like coin collection and star mechanics.
- Major Milestones: A public demo is planned for release "in a few weeks" to showcase improvements and manage community expectations. Kaze mentions a to-do list and being in the "last three areas" for a certain scope of work, suggesting progress towards completion of specific sections.
- Development Stages: The stream shows live development, including modeling, texturing (placeholders), programming new behaviors (matchbox bridge, paper snowballs, confetti), and level design. Iteration is a key part of the process.

## Personal Insights
- Kaze prioritizes getting work done on stream over direct entertainment, stating "my priority today is not on entertaining but rather on getting work done... entertainment today will be coincidental."
- He expresses satisfaction with certain aesthetic choices, such as the "crayon drawing" look of a level element: "you know what i love the most about this it actually ends up looking like a crayon drawing once you're done here... this does look like someone's shitty crayon drawing..."
- He reflects on development tools for future projects, expressing a preference for Godot over Unreal Engine 5 for indie development due to iteration speed: "So the cool thing about Godot over Unreal Engine is that iteration is a lot faster... I think it's gonna be a lot more viable for development than Unreal Engine, because Unreal Engine is so goddamn slow."
- He has a direct and sometimes provocative communication style, e.g., his response to a Nintendo DMCA: "I responded to the email with just suck my cock... And nothing happened."

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: No relevant information found in this transcript.
- Biobak:
    - Kaze consults Biobak for opinions on visual elements: "Biobank what do you think of the new styrofoam? your opinion here matters."
    - Potentially tasked with creating assets like a new exclamation box: "Oh yeah, I also want to make a new exclamation box... Do you want to give it a try, if you're still here? [Biobak implied]"
- Zeina:
    - Kaze might ask Zeina to create final textures for assets he makes placeholders for: "I might ask Zeyna to make a good version of it [the matchbox texture]." (The prompt mentioned animations for Zeina, but this transcript refers to texture work).
- Other Contributors:
    - Lila (chat user): Suggested matchbox brand names "Game & Match" and "Lethal Lava Logs," which Kaze liked and decided to use.
    - Mushi (chat user): Kaze solicits their opinion on new assets (e.g., the hut) and discusses design changes with them.
    - Unnamed "guy in my showcase channel": Created a model for an exclamation box that Kaze considered using.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Coin System Overhaul:**
    - Red coins are now localized to specific areas to be less frustrating: "red coins in this game are always contained to one area because otherwise red coins suck."
    - Yoshi coins are awarded for "really rare special interactions" and exploring unconventional areas. They are "stored globally" like "mini objectives."
    - 100-coin stars have been completely removed: "no level has a 100 coin star not a single one."
- **Star Collection & Level Progression:**
    - There are seven "acts" (stars) per level. The 7th star is "find the egg coins" and features a radar mechanic.
    - Deliberate decisions on whether collecting a star kicks the player out of the level: "a lot of surf stars have to kick you out because otherwise you would just be stuck in the dead end... red coins just don't kick you out and yoshi coins does kick you out [mistake, later clarifies collect-a-thon stars don't kick you out]." Later corrected: "any collect text y star doesn't kick you out".
- **Level-Specific Mechanics & Aesthetics (Course 14 - Snow/Craft Theme):**
    - Crayon drawing aesthetic: "it actually ends up looking like a crayon drawing." The crayon is a pickup item used to draw a star.
    - Temporary bridge: Iterated from simple cardboard to a matchbox design suggested by chat. Involves a timed mechanism.
    - Snowball enemies: Design iterated from cotton to crumpled paper. They target Mario.
    - Particle effects: Paper snowflakes as environmental confetti.
- **Challenges:**
    - Designing and implementing level-specific interactive elements (bridge, snowball spawner).
    - Achieving desired visual effects and aesthetics (e.g., making convincing "craft" snowballs, matchbox textures).
    - Resolving technical issues like lighting inconsistencies: "it's a bit weird how the light on this looks... i don't understand why this one is so dark compared to the top one."
    - Reusing mechanics: The crayon will be used to color a map to reveal a path elsewhere.

## Business Aspects
- **Distribution:** The game will be a free download: "Of course it will be free download. I can't charge money for this, Nintendo would actually murder me."
- **Marketing/Release:**
    - A demo is planned "in a few weeks" to show improvements and "some people leave me alone and stop asking me for release dates."
    - Kaze plans other YouTube videos (BLJ video, "what am I doing on this channel" video) before the demo release, indicating a content schedule around his development.
- **Funding:** No direct funding for the game itself is mentioned, though Kaze acknowledges Twitch Prime money from viewers during the stream.

## Key Quotes
- "red coins in this game are always contained to one area because otherwise red coins suck... and the yoshi coins you get them for really rare special interactions so you have to do things that others would not really think of or go places that you usually wouldn't go to." (Explaining core design changes)
- "my priority today is not on entertaining but rather on getting work done... entertainment today will be coincidental which i think is how my streams should be anyway" (On his streaming and development philosophy)
- "Okay, I know I can't draw textures, which is why I'm going to make a temporary texture with the name of it on it... I might ask Zeyna to make a good version of it." (Highlighting the iterative and collaborative nature of asset creation)

## Potential Interview Topics
- Explore the core design philosophy behind "Return to Yoshi's Island," particularly the motivations for overhauling SM64's collectible systems (Red Coins, Yoshi Coins, 100-coin star removal).
- Discuss the iterative design process for level-specific mechanics, using the matchbox bridge in Course 14 as an example, including how community feedback is incorporated.
- Detail the collaboration process with artists like Biobak and Zeyna: How are creative visions aligned? How is work distributed and feedback managed for assets like textures and models?
- Delve into the inspiration and technical/artistic challenges of achieving the "craft" or "crayon drawing" aesthetic for certain levels, and how this theme influences gameplay mechanics.
- Kaze's perspective on the N64 ROM hacking scene, the impact of the SM64 decompilation, and his thoughts on navigating legal concerns (like DMCAs) as a prominent figure in the community.
