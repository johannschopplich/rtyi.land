## Game Development Process
- The game is actively in development, with Kaze working on 3D modeling, level design, programming, and bug fixing.
- A significant technical upgrade involves the use of "FBDX3" (presumably Fast3D EXtension v3), which has improved RSP (Reality Signal Processor) performance, addressing previous bottlenecks.
- Kaze is creating custom systems, such as a per-level memory allocator for collision data and a refactored mirror system.
- Current focus includes fixing a persistent lighting bug where ambient light resets with multiple light sources, and resolving collision surface ("surf") limitations.
- Performance is a key concern, with a target of 60 FPS on N64 hardware, achieved through techniques like room culling.
- A phased release plan is in place: Version 1 for emulators and N64, Version 1.1 with bug fixes for both, and a subsequent version potentially dropping emulator-specific support to maximize N64 performance.
- A demo is planned, focusing on "Chris 1" (likely Course 1), but the lighting bug needs to be fixed before its release.

## Personal Insights
- Kaze is driven by a passion for N64 development and a desire to push the hardware's capabilities.
- He expresses strong, pragmatic opinions on software development, e.g., "I think that if you care at all, like even just a little bit about which programming language you use, that is a very strong indicator that you're a terrible programmer."
- He acknowledges the challenges of balancing this extensive project with a full-time job and family responsibilities, stating, "Because I have a child now and I need more money. So hopefully there will be more streams, but I don't know how I'm going to manage the time wise since I do have a full-time job on top of being all of this."
- He is skeptical of emulator accuracy for N64 development: "I'm not gonna trust any emulator ever to actually be accurate to what N64 acts like... the N64 is fucked up."
- He shows resilience and humor in the face of challenges, including technical bugs and even an attempted spear-phishing scam.

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub:** No specific contributions mentioned in this transcript.
- **Biobak (Graphics Artist):**
    - Kaze prepares levels and models with Biobak's review in mind: "Really, it's just kind of getting these rooms to look a little nicer. So it's not insulting to Biobank when I pass this over."
    - Biobak appears to have high standards for visual quality and precision, with Kaze humorously mentioning "the wrath of Biobank" if things aren't visually correct.
- **Zeina (Animator):** Greeted as "Zena" at the beginning of the stream, but no specific contributions to "Return to Yoshi's Island" are detailed in this transcript.
- **Other Contributors:**
    - **Soren (Sauron):** A key collaborator working on FBDX3 and RSP microcode improvements. Kaze mentions waiting for Soren to finish his work on microcode and credits their joint effort in identifying the RSP as a performance bottleneck, which FBDX3 helped alleviate.
    - **WiseGuy:** Mentioned positively for his work on a static recompilation PC port of SM64, Kaze notes "WiseGuy knows what he's doing."
    - **Dario:** Mentioned in relation to the RT64 (N64 Ray Tracing) project; Kaze trusts Dario's word on when that project is considered "done."

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Room-based Level Design for Performance:** Levels are structured in rooms with doors that occlude visibility, ensuring better performance and aiming for "guaranteed 60 FPS."
- **Lighting System Issues:** A major challenge is a bug where additional light sources cause ambient lighting to reset to zero. This is a priority fix, especially for the demo.
- **Collision Management:** The game faces issues with the N64's collision surface limits ("surf"). Kaze has implemented a custom memory allocator per level to address this, but it's an ongoing concern.
- **Mirror Implementation:** Kaze refactored the mirror system to be flag-based and more efficient/easier to use, describing it as "the easiest system to add new murals ever."
- **Visual Effects vs. Performance:** Kaze notes some visual effects, like a "focus" effect, are "completely free" performance-wise, indicating an effort to maximize visual appeal within N64 constraints.
- **Balancing Aesthetics and N64 Authenticity:** Decisions on ceiling design (e.g., fading to black) and texture work are made with the N64's rendering capabilities in mind.
- **Blender UV Mapping:** Kaze expresses frustration with UV mapping issues in newer Blender versions.

## Business Aspects
- **Distribution Method:** Due to legal constraints with Nintendo copyright, the game will be released as a patch. Kaze states, "I will release a patch that will contain only my own changes. And then you will be ableable to patch this patch onto an N64 ROM."
- **No Official Physical Release:** Kaze explicitly states, "No, I can't physically release this game, Christian. Because if I do, I will get giga sued by Nintendo." He is aware of unofficial sellers illegally distributing his games.
- **Monetization/Funding:** While not a direct business model for the game, Kaze mentions his personal need for more money (due to having a child) as a motivation for streaming more. Donations are a part of his streaming, though he notes an issue with donation alerts not working.
- **Advertising Scam Attempt:** Kaze recounts a sophisticated spear-phishing attempt from a fake advertiser, highlighting a non-developmental challenge faced by content creators.

## Key Quotes
- "Ever since x3 we have one little bug in the game... if a second light source appears like the star over there Morris colors just go dark the ambient just resets to zero." (Highlights a key technical challenge)
- "Basically, my plan is version 1 of Return to Yoshi's Island is going to work on emulator and N64... And then I will ditch emulator support entirely." (Outlines the release strategy and commitment to N64 hardware)
- "I think that if you care at all, like even just a little bit about which programming language you use, that is a very strong indicator that you're a terrible programmer." (Shows Kaze's pragmatic development philosophy)
- "Really, it's just kind of getting these rooms to look a little nicer. So it's not insulting to Biobank when I pass this over." (Illustrates the collaborative workflow and quality standards)
