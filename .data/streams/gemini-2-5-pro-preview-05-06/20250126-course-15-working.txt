## Game Development Process
- Kaze is actively developing a "space level" or "Cosmic Colony" (also referred to as a "plantation" or "space greenhouse"), focusing on platforming mechanics, visual polish (textures, glow effects, signs), and level layout.
- The development process is iterative: core platforming is established first, and then aesthetic elements and narrative justifications are built around it ("Really what we're doing now is we already made the platforming, and now we're just trying to justify the platforms we've made.")
- There's an expectation of a later "debug" phase where much of the current work will be reworked or refined.
- Story development is secondary to gameplay in the initial stages: "We haven't really planned the story yet. I think it's better to just put together some gameplay first, and then plan the story around the gameplay you have."
- Performance on actual N64 hardware is a consideration, with Kaze testing builds on console and noting FPS ("43 FPS. Ooh, it doesn't like all these plants here.")
- Work involves using tools like Fast64 (a Blender add-on).
- Specific features being implemented/refined include:
    - Bumpers for movement.
    - Low-poly crops.
    - Signs for guidance.
    - Glowing outlines for platform visibility.
    - Skybox implementation.
    - Star collection animations (blinking).
    - Textures for various surfaces (platforms, water tanks).

## Personal Insights
- Kaze expresses a strong desire for ROM hacks, including "Return to Yoshi's Island" (RTYI), to be recognized as legitimate games capable of standing on their own, independent of the original Mario 64 context. ("I feel like right now, people don't respect RomEx as like real games... I definitely want to change that.")
- He believes gameplay should precede story development in Mario games.
- Kaze values player freedom in game design ("For me, gaming is all about freedom.").
- He is candid about his motivations, including financial ones for intensive work periods.
- He shares personal anecdotes (e.g., his dislike for Mario Tennis) and opinions on various topics like anime, operating systems, and AI, offering a glimpse into his personality beyond game development.

- Zeina: No specific information found in this transcript regarding Zeina's direct contributions to RTYI.
- Other Contributors:
    - **Dariel:** Mentioned in connection with wanting a sound clip of Kaze sneezing for "the compact we're working on." It's unclear if this "compact" is RTYI or a different project.
    - **Unnamed Texture Artist:** An individual DMed Kaze offering to replace textures in the level being worked on. Kaze is open to seeing their work: "Well, if they put in enough work, I think they can make it better, so we'll see. They seem pretty skilled at what they're doing." This suggests an openness to community contributions for art assets.
    - **Kyukiram (chat commenter):** Mentioned as working on "all the decoms," indicating Kaze's awareness of and interaction with key figures in the broader SM64 decompilation community.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Visual Clarity:** A recurring challenge is ensuring platforms and interactive elements are clearly visible to the player. Solution example: "I'm going to have glowing outlines on all the platforms in The End."
- **Level "Feel" / "Sauce":** Kaze strives to make levels feel good to play, referring to a "sauce" that a level might initially lack but gains through iteration.
- **Technical Bugs:** Encountering and addressing game crashes, such as one related to Backward Long Jumps (BLJs): "My fucking game crashed. ... It's clearly something in the PLJ code itself causing an infinite loop somewhere." He later seems to fix it or understand it better.
- **Performance Optimization:** Ensuring the game runs well on N64 hardware, especially with many objects on screen ("Ooh, it doesn't like all these plants here. 43 FPS.").
- **Gameplay Mechanics:**
    - Designing jump sequences and platforming challenges that are fun and not "jank."
    - Considering speedrun strategies and how they impact level design. ("I want to see what the speedrun strat would be like.")
    - Deciding whether to support or fix unintended mechanics like BLJs.
- **Aesthetics and Theming:** Making choices about textures, color palettes, and object design to fit the "space plantation" theme (e.g., designing "low-poly crops," water tanks).
- **Player Guidance:** Using elements like signs ("We also have these signs now that just point to the factory") to improve navigation.
- **Iterative Design:** Constantly tweaking elements based on testing and feedback (e.g., platform placement, texture choices, effect intensity).

## Business Aspects
- **Open Source Release:** Kaze states, "I'm planning to open source this game anyway, so there's little point in leaking it." This is a significant decision regarding the game's distribution and future.
- **Monetization (Hypothetical):** Kaze discusses a hypothetical stream idea where donations would extend development time for a new hack ("for every $1,000 of every $500 donated, we add an extra day of stream... I think that could be the money idea."). He clarifies this would be for his "bank account," not charity. This is not explicitly for RTYI but shows his thinking on funding development.
- **Views on ROM Hacking and Commercial Viability:** Discussion about whether a game heavily inspired by Mario 64 could be sold legally, prompted by looking at "Kero Quest." Kaze notes he's "not even planning to do that" (sell RTYI).

## Key Quotes
- "I feel like right now, people don't respect RomEx as like real games. Even RomEx don't seem to do that. So I definitely want to change that. I want to make sure that this RomEx is also like playable as like a normal game without the context of Mario 64." (Reflects his ambition for the project and ROM hacks in general).
- "Really what we're doing now is we already made the platforming, and now we're just trying to justify the platforms we've made." (Illustrates his iterative, gameplay-first design philosophy).
- "We haven't really planned the story yet. I think it's better to just put together some gameplay first, and then plan the story around the gameplay you have. Because it's a Mario game." (Explains his approach to narrative design within the context of a Mario game).

## Potential Interview Topics
- **Philosophy of ROM Hacking as Game Development:** Explore Kaze's vision for "Return to Yoshi's Island" as a standalone game. How does this philosophy influence specific design choices, scope, and polish compared to more traditional ROM hacks?
- **The Iterative Design Process for a Level:** Using the "Cosmic Colony" / "space plantation" level as an example, delve into the typical lifecycle of level creation in RTYI – from initial concept and platforming blockout to aesthetic refinement, technical optimization, and incorporating player feedback.
- **Technical Challenges and Innovations with SM64 Decompilation:** Discuss the most significant technical hurdles faced (e.g., performance, custom features like advanced shaders/skyboxes, fixing/supporting complex mechanics like BLJs) and the innovative solutions or workarounds developed for RTYI.
- **Collaboration and Community in RTYI's Development:** How does Kaze manage and integrate contributions from collaborators (like composers, artists, animators, as mentioned in the prompt, even if not detailed in this specific transcript for RTYI) and the wider community (e.g., texture artists, beta testers)? How does this impact the final game?
- **Open Sourcing RTYI and Future Aspirations:** What are Kaze's motivations and hopes for releasing RTYI as an open-source project? What impact does he hope it will have on the SM64 modding community and beyond?
