## Game Development Process
- Kaze is actively working on a specific level/section inspired by Mario Land, focusing on creating 3D assets for enemies (a bird-like creature, "chicken" from Mario Land 1) and implementing their behavior (shooting, death animations).
- He mentions, "After this I have two more stages, but course 14 is already like half way done," indicating progress tracking and a larger game structure.
- The process involves modeling, texturing, considering animations (wing movement, death sequence using animated textures), and integrating sound effects.
- He outlines next steps: "what we need next is just the enemy airplanes and their bullet bill and then we have all the assets done and we can make the level."
- Optimization is a concern, evidenced by comments on triangle counts ("This already has 19,000 triangles and it's like barely finished").
- Debugging graphics plugin issues (Gliden) and considering future plugins like RT64 is part of the workflow.

## Personal Insights
- Kaze expresses feeling exhausted but continues to work: "I feel so exhausted today... I don't know why I'm so exhausted."
- He has strong opinions on game accessibility within the ROM hacking community: "This is something that rom hackers severely underrate and it's the barrier to entry... every step along the way... you lose some percentage of your player base... it is something i'm very worried of."
- He reflects on the nature of his project: "Well, would you want to just play a copy of Mario Land on Mario 64? What's the point in that? Right, it has to be different and I chose to make it different by having it be 3D."
- He voices concerns about potential Nintendo takedowns but accepts it as a risk: "of course there is a worry that nintendo is just going to say now fuck you your game is over but you just have to live with that."
- Kaze shares his personal stance on pirating games (dislikes it due to virus risks) and his preference for C++ over C ("C++ is basically the same as C just for some extra features. So it's really just a better C").

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub (composer):** No specific contributions or interactions detailed in this transcript segment.
- **Biobak (graphics artist):** No specific contributions or interactions detailed in this transcript segment.
- **Zeina (animations):** No specific contributions or interactions detailed in this transcript segment.
- **Other Contributors:**
    - **Leela (Viewer/Community Contributor):** Actively engages with Kaze in the chat, provides a 2D sprite of the bird enemy ("Alright, let's see this in your image... Alright, let's see if we can make changes to our bird based on this"), offers suggestions on game design, and discusses various topics with Kaze.
    - **Onionkit (Viewer/Community Contributor):** Kaze requests a Bullet Bill front view sprite from them: "onionkit if you want you can send them to me on discord like in my discord that would be perfect".
    - **Wiseguy (Developer):** Kaze mentions consulting him about RT64: "You know what, I'll ask Wiseguy himself right now. Is RT64 out already?"
    - **Falco Buster:** Mentioned for a "PNG fixer" tool Kaze uses.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Translating 2D to 3D:** A core challenge is adapting 2D gameplay concepts (from Mario Land) into a 3D space. This includes camera perspective ("How are you going to aim like that? And how are you going to know where the play area ends... Those are two big issues with that idea.") and enemy design.
- **Camera System:** Kaze is hesitant about significantly changing the camera angle for the on-rails shooter section due to aiming and play area visibility concerns. He notes, "I have tried having the camera follow Mario at the beginning and it did not look good at all. It was way too much movement."
- **Enemy Design and Behavior:** Kaze works on the bird enemy's model, aiming for a "somewhat low poly" look that translates the original sprite. He implements its shooting ability and a death animation using animated textures ("what if we just have it be an animated texture... it just switches between those 8 frames").
- **Technical Limitations:** N64 hardware constraints (e.g., polygon count: "This already has 19,000 triangles") and graphics plugin issues (Gliden's point filtering, potential asymmetry) influence design and visual output.
- **Player Experience:** Kaze prioritizes a unique experience over a direct port: "it has to be different and I chose to make it different by having it be 3D." He also considers how players will perceive depth and interact with elements.
- **Sound Design:** Kaze experiments with different sound effects for actions like enemy shots, settling on a "Hounding cannon" sound.
- **Asset Re-use/Modification:** When Leela provides a sprite, Kaze considers how to incorporate its elements (like the head and eyes) into his existing 3D model rather than completely redoing it.

## Business Aspects
- **YouTube Strategy:** Kaze emphasizes the importance of consistent thumbnail design for his YouTube videos to increase viewer engagement: "It's important on YouTube that your thumbnails have a somewhat consistent style, because it makes people more likely to flick them." He specifies his desired style using "the random Mario from back then."
- **Demo Release:** He plans to release a demo of the game: "I'm gonna release a new demo at some point in the near future... it's just going to be the first course."
- **Asset Sharing:** Kaze intends to make the game's assets publicly available: "I'll definitely publish everything including assets... yeah I would release the blend files as well."
- **No mention of direct funding or commercial sales.** The focus is on community engagement and open sharing.
