## Game Development Process
- The game, "Return to Yoshi's Island," features a new, "huge overworld" designed as a single, interconnected level, replacing a previous iteration that didn't meet quality standards.
- Kaze estimates the project is roughly "10% done," indicating it's still in a relatively early but substantial phase of development.
- Active work is being done on various "parts" (sections/levels) of the overworld, including designing entrances and connections between them (e.g., Part 5, Part 7, Part 8, Course 6).
- The ROM size is currently just under 60MB.
- Playtesting is considered very valuable, with plans to get more individual playtests done to gather data.
- Kaze is using his custom game engine, which offers different functionalities compared to the vanilla Mario 64 engine (e.g., improved handling of invisible walls).
- Development involves iterative design, with Kaze frequently reassessing and looking to improve areas, such as making a cave "interesting" or redesigning a "depressing and sad" beach.
- There was a significant loss of "old hack code" and "a lot of documentation" due to a previous SSD failure, which has not been recovered.

## Personal Insights
- Kaze expresses a strong preference for creating new systems rather than dealing with the frustrations of existing ones, stating, "It's not like you're making new systems, you know. That's what I do."
- A core design philosophy for the game is to have "secrets around every corner," aiming for a sense of discovery and depth.
- Kaze is critical of "safe" AAA game development and champions "risky" games that are creatively driven, citing the original Yoshi's Island as an example of the kind of innovative spirit he admires.
- He finds computers and their underlying systems "very frustrating to deal with."
- Kaze candidly shares his physical state, mentioning feeling "so sick today" and "very feverish," which impacts his streaming and potentially his work.
- He reflects on the limitations of the original Mario 64 engine, calling it "just the worst" and stating that programmers of that era (with some exceptions like Guile) "made everyone's job a lot harder."

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub:** No direct mention of Badub or specific musical contributions to "Return to Yoshi's Island" in this transcript. Kaze does mention listening to an OST (Pokemon XY) and ensuring his Mario's sounds are audible.
- **Biobak:** Interacts with "Biobank" in chat, which is likely Biobak. No specific graphical contributions to "Return to Yoshi's Island" are detailed in this transcript beyond Kaze mentioning some textures are "random texture from the N64."
- **Zeina:** Contributes visual concepts and drawings. Kaze refers to "Zena's drawings" for a cave design, though he decided to go in a different direction for that specific instance. He also mentions an "wasabi song" he invented that Zena doesn't believe is good.
- **Other Contributors:**
    - **ESA:** "ESA is actually working on a slight level right now." (Assumed to be a level designer).

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Overworld Redesign:** The original overworld was "completely erased" because it wasn't up to quality standards. The current approach is a "huge overworld" that is "all going to be one level."
- **Secrets and Exploration:** A primary goal is for "the whole island to feel like there's secrets around every corner."
- **Multiplayer:** Considered a desirable feature ("something I would like to do"), and Kaze doesn't think it would be "too difficult to do" in general, but specific elements like boss fights (e.g., "the raven boss fight") would be "jank with it."
- **Custom Engine Benefits:** Kaze's custom engine uses a "whole different step function" than vanilla Mario 64, which helps avoid issues like hitting "thin invisible walls."
- **Level Design Challenges:**
    - Making large areas like caves and beaches interesting and not "flat and boring."
    - Integrating numerous level entrances (e.g., "Part 7, part 8, part 9, part 6, and part 12 entrances") coherently.
    - Deciding how to handle transitions and player flow, e.g., what happens if a player falls down a river ("Do we make it so that if you fall down the river, you come back out in part one here? Or how do we stop the player from going through the river? I guess we can also just make a grate.").
- **Technical Issues:**
    - A major recurring challenge is disk space on his C: drive, which at one point prevented him from opening Photoshop. Much of the stream is dedicated to troubleshooting this.
    - Frustration with hard-coded file paths making SSD changes difficult.
    - Dealing with Windows updates potentially consuming disk space.
- **Specific Level Ideas/Features:**
    - A "cave offensive" or secret side level within a cave.
    - A river running through the whole island, connecting to a volcano area.
    - A secret loop back from a forest area to an earlier part of the overworld.
    - Course 6 ("Jurassic Jungle") featuring prehistoric Yoshis.
    - Considering adding Yoshi houses, rocks in the water, wooden bridges, trees, and sand dunes to make areas less flat.
    - Idea for a sandcastle obstacle course for a blue coin.

## Business Aspects
- **Sponsorships:** Kaze has "a lot of sponsors" that he needs to make videos for, indicating this is a source of income.
- **Donations:** He acknowledges a viewer donation ("Johan, thank you for the 100 for a new SSD...").
- **No Cartridge Sales:** Kaze explicitly states he will not be "releasing cartridges" or selling them due to "legal issues." The game will be released online via his YouTube channel.
- **Content Creation for Revenue:** Making videos for sponsors is linked to generating content for his audience.
- **Twitter Monetization Attempt:** Mentioned trying to make money from Twitter posts, but "that just did not happen."

## Key Quotes
- "Yeah, it's the new overworld for Return to Yoshi's Island. We're making a huge overworld and this is all going to be one level."
- "I want the whole island to feel like there's secrets around every corner after all."
- "Let's start making based games again simpler games not just the Hey, let's throw six million dollars at it and make something very safe that is guaranteed to not be garbage type games We'd be making risky games again."
- "My hard drive is just so full that I can't open the thing... This is insane." (Highlighting a major immediate challenge)

## Potential Interview Topics
- Explore the decision-making process behind scrapping the old overworld and committing to the current "huge single-level overworld" concept for "Return to Yoshi's Island." What specific quality standards weren't met by the original, and what opportunities does the new approach offer?
- Discuss Kaze's philosophy on embedding "secrets around every corner." How does he approach the design of these secrets to ensure they are discoverable yet rewarding, and how does this tie into his overall vision for player experience in the game?
- Delve into the development and advantages of his custom Mario 64 engine. What were the primary motivations for creating it, and how specifically does it enable features or overcome limitations of the original engine for "Return to Yoshi's Island"?
- Ask about the collaborative dynamic with contributors like Zena and ESA. How are creative ideas exchanged, and how are external contributions integrated into Kaze's overarching vision for the project?
- Given the legal restrictions on selling ROM hacks, how does Kaze navigate the financial realities of dedicating significant time to such a large-scale project? How do sponsorships and community support factor into its continued development?
