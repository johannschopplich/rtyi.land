## Game Development Process
- The "Return to Yoshi's Island" (RTYI) demo is complete but faces a booting issue on Parallel Launcher, which Kaze is working to resolve with the launcher's maintainer.
- Kaze follows a development methodology of establishing basic structures ("broadest thing") before adding details ("finest detail").
- Development is highly iterative; Kaze is willing to completely overhaul level concepts if they don't meet his vision for fun or "placeness" (e.g., scrapping the "Space Arcade" theme for a level).
- A level named "Astrologate" underwent a significant thematic redesign during the stream, evolving into "Shy Sky Station," a Shy Guy space colony.
- Performance target for console is 30 FPS.
- The game will feature a custom camera system.
- The overworld is considered a very important part of the game, aiming for an elaborate design allowing exploration of the entirety of Yoshi's Island.
- The game will include "retro areas" in each level; the one discussed will be Mario 64 themed.

## Personal Insights
- Kaze is highly self-critical of his work, openly stating when he feels a design is "terrible" or "sucks."
- He prioritizes the "Mario 64 spirit," emphasizing core platforming fun over mini-games or mechanics that feel like a "chore" (referencing "Donkey Kong 64" negatively).
- The concept of "placeness" – making levels feel like coherent, real environments – is a crucial design goal for Kaze.
- He expresses frustration with providing one-on-one personalized help, preferring users to seek assistance in help channels.
- Kaze is not interested in Mario 64 beta recreations, finding them overdone and uninteresting.
- He actively tries to avoid directly copying elements from other games (like Mario Galaxy) while brainstorming.

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub (also referred to as Adobe):** Composer for the game. His music is available on SoundCloud. Kaze mentions needing to potentially pay Badub for music rights if the game is monetized.
- **Biobak (also referred to as Biomax):** Graphics artist. Credited with the idea for an animated sun effect. Kaze mentions needing to pay Biobak for his work.
- **Zeina:** (Animations) No specific contributions or interactions mentioned in this transcript.
- **Other Contributors:**
    - **Person maintaining Parallel Launcher:** Actively working with Kaze to fix a bug preventing the RTYI demo from booting on the platform. (Name not specified).

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Level Theme Overhaul (Astrologate/Shy Sky Station):**
    - Initial "Space Arcade" theme for a level was heavily criticized by Kaze for its aesthetics (e.g., "ugly arcade carpet," "glowing stuff") and lack of "placeness."
    - Integrating arcade machine gameplay (Pac-Man, Donkey Kong, Tetris) was considered but ultimately rejected as not fun and not fitting the Mario 64 spirit.
    - The theme was changed to a "Shy Guy Space Station" (or "Shy Sky Station"), focusing on a Shy Guy civilization with retro-futuristic (1950s/60s) technology, space houses, crop plantations, and water storage.
- **Level Structure and Player Guidance:**
    - The new "Shy Sky Station" level is planned to have Star 1 involve defeating a "bioluminescent space squid" boss, which then unlocks other areas of the level.
    - The idea of using "space taxis" (looking like 1950s imagined flying cars) to guide players to different objective areas (crop plantation, water plantation) is being implemented.
    - The goal is for the player to perceive multiple objectives early on but have access gated until the initial squid boss is defeated, fostering a sense of an open yet structured world.
- **Visuals and Atmosphere:**
    - Kaze wants to avoid Mario's walking surfaces being too bright to maintain contrast and player visibility.
    - Floating TVs will feature Shy Guy "propaganda" or newscasts, potentially showing Mario attacking Shy Guys, to add to the theme.
- **Gameplay Mechanics:**
    - Low gravity zones are considered good but their implementation needs refinement to feel connected to something.
    - Kaze is against implementing mini-games that feel like playing a different game (e.g., Pac-Man, Tetris as stars). Stars should primarily be about platforming.
- **Technical Considerations:**
    - Making the level feel bigger without actual large-scale expansion is a challenge. Ideas like making Mario half-size were considered and rejected due to collision and movement complications.
    - Instant warps are a possibility for transitions.

## Business Aspects
- Kaze plans to "quietly drop the demo" without a dedicated announcement video.
- He expresses a desire to potentially monetize "Return to Yoshi's Island" and use funds to pay collaborators like musicians (Badub) and artists (Biobak).
- Legal considerations for monetization, such as music rights for potential cartridge releases and consulting a copyright lawyer, are acknowledged.
- A significant financial donation (500 Euros) was received during the stream, which Kaze noted could help fund the game or pay collaborators.

## Key Quotes
- "By the way, the RTYI demo is finished now. But there is a bug in Parallel Launcher that makes my ROM not boot. I'm currently trying to fix it together with the person maintaining Parallel Launcher." (Shows progress, immediate challenge, and collaboration).
- "I think the problem is we're pushing the arcade theme too much and like no matter how we implement the arcade theme it's not gonna be fun... We made the important realization. That the idea we had for this level is terrible. And we're going to do something better." (Highlights the iterative design process and willingness to scrap ideas).
- "So I'm thinking Star 1. The big bioluminescent space squid is around and everyone's scared... And you have to climb through the level to the space squid. Kill it. And then everything else in the level unlocks." (Illustrates the new creative direction and structural thinking for a level).
