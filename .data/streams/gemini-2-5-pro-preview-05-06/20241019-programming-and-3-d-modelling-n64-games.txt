## Game Development Process
- **Current Focus (as of stream):**
    - Intensive work on programming and fine-tuning paper airplane physics for a specific level mechanic, involving significant trial-and-error with variables affecting flight dynamics (velocity, pitch, tipping forces).
    - Implementing and debugging interactions for a paper target mission, including Mario breaking targets and a Toad NPC (Mr. Totodile) dispensing a star.
    - Working on animations in Blender for level elements, such as a rubber band for a slingshot mechanism.
    - Fixing bugs related to N64 performance, anti-aliasing, and specific gameplay interactions (e.g., cannon launch).
- **Major Milestones Mentioned:**
    - **Demo Completion:** "The demo is all done, by the way. I fixed all the N64 bugs." This indicates a significant portion of the game or a specific showcase version is complete and polished.
    - **Feature Implementation:** Successful implementation of paper targets, cannons, and basic NPC interactions.
- **Development Stages/Workflow:**
    - Iterative development: Constantly tweaking parameters, testing, and refining mechanics live on stream ("fudging the numbers").
    - Combination of on-stream and off-stream work: "I always do off-stream work." "I finished programming the paper targets off stream."
    - Use of decompilation: The game is a ROM hack based on the Mario 64 decompilation.
    - Tooling: Uses Fast64 for level exporting, Blender for animations.
    - Performance Optimization for N64: Actively working on ensuring good FPS, fixing rendering issues (e.g., anti-aliasing, Z-ordering) on actual hardware.

## Personal Insights
- **On the Development Process:**
    - Finds programming complex physics (like the paper plane) challenging and time-consuming: "I didn't think that programming a paper plane was going to be this much of a problem."
    - Prefers creating physics-based systems over pre-scripted animations for a more dynamic feel, even if it's harder: "doing these computations, I prefer that. That's why there's some kind of physical basis for it."
    - Values time efficiency in development: "we care about time efficiency here."
- **On Streaming Development:**
    - Experiences frustration with Twitch chat: "You know, I thought what made you insane when you rommake is like the rommaking itself. But no, it's Twitch chat like watching you rommake." and "I often get very, very annoyed at chat when they just ask really stupid questions."
    - Acknowledges enjoyment despite frustrations: "I do kind of really like streaming. It's just that sometimes I just can't deal with it, I think."
- **On Game Design & Industry:**
    - Confident in his project: "if you just make a hack or make a game that doesn't suck, I think it's going to be popular."
    - Critical of some existing games/trends (e.g., Battle for Bikini Bottom's simplicity, Conker's Bad Fur Day as a "clip show").
- **Future Plans:**
    - Intends to make his own original game after "Return to Yoshi's Island," likely a 3D platformer in Unreal Engine 5, or potentially his own engine.

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub (composer):** No specific mention of Badub or their contributions in this transcript. Kaze does ask "What is the OST that we would like to listen to today?" but it's unclear if this refers to game-specific music by Badub.
- **Biobak (graphics artist):** No specific mention of Biobak or their contributions. Kaze praises some visual aspects like lighting ("The lighting on it looks so good too, though. Holy shit.") but this is not directly attributed.
- **Zeina (animations):** Kaze states, "I'm not the animator for this game anyway," indicating someone else handles primary animation work. While working on a rubber band animation in Blender, he says, "Really, I just need a decent base so that we can make this work," suggesting he might create placeholders or foundational animations.
- **Other Contributors:**
    - "GBA Mario 64 guy": Mentioned as a potential collaborator for a YouTube video, not directly for RTYI development.
    - General team implied for art/animation roles.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Paper Airplane Mechanic:**
    - **Goal:** Create a dynamic, "swoop, swoop" movement akin to a real paper plane, used as a way to ascend a pyramid in a level tentatively named "Handmade Heights."
    - **Challenge:** Achieving stable yet dynamic flight through complex physics calculations; the system is described as "volatile, chaotic." Many iterations of tweaking variables for pitch, velocity, gravity, and tipping forces.
    - **Solution:** Iterative "fudging" of physics values, experimenting with different forces and dependencies (e.g., making pitch acceleration depend on `face_angle_pitch`).
- **Level Design ("Handmade Heights" / Course 14/15):**
    - Features multiple biomes: "desert, the permits here, and then there's the mountains here with the Styrofoam... and then there is the castle here and the grasslands."
    - Incorporates unique traversal mechanics like the paper plane to reach specific areas (e.g., top of a pyramid).
- **NPC Interaction (Toad/Mr. Totodile):**
    - Designing the logic for an NPC to give Mario a star after a specific action sequence.
    - Tweaking dialogue and presentation to fit a "mechanical" theme for the cardboard cutout NPCs.
- **Slingshot/Rubber Band Animation:**
    - Challenge: Creating a realistic and satisfying elastic snap-back animation in Blender.
    - Kaze works on this himself, aiming for a "decent base" even if he's not the primary animator.
- **Technical Choices:**
    - Preference for physics-based systems over splines for certain animations to provide a "physical basis."
    - Utilizing F3DX3 for performance benefits as the game is "RSP bottlenecked."
- **Bug Fixing:**
    - Addressed a bug where pressing 'A' on the first frame out of a cannon caused issues.
    - Working on Z-ordering issues and anti-aliasing on N64.

## Business Aspects
- **Marketing & Promotion:**
    - Primarily uses his existing YouTube channel ("Kaze Emanuar") for marketing: "I feel like I do all my marketing over my main account, right?"
    - Planned YouTube content to promote the game: a video explaining VLJ, a video about his channel's direction, and then "the demo thing."
    - Considers creating separate social media for a "real game" in the future but prefers using his established presence for RTYI.
- **Audience Engagement:**
    - Views his YouTube channel (300,000 subscribers mentioned) as a significant platform for "free advertisement."
    - Plans content like a review of the Analogue 3D, seeing it as a way to reach his audience, hoping for an early copy for timely release.
- **Release/Distribution:**
    - A demo of "Return to Yoshi's Island" is "all done" and its release is part of his YouTube content plan.
- **Funding:** No direct mention of funding for the project.
