## Game Development Process
- The game "Return to Yoshi's Island" is approximately two-thirds complete after nearly three years of development.
- The project is currently in a "polishing phase" for older areas while new content, like the "Oil Rig" level, is actively being designed and implemented.
- Major engine changes have largely been completed.
- Kaze anticipates at least another year and a half of development, partly due to his full-time job.
- Development includes creating new levels, designing boss fights (e.g., the Oil Blarg), implementing NPC behaviors (e.g., Buzzy Beetles), and refining existing mechanics like camera and fog.
- A secret "Magic Show" Easter egg level is planned but not yet started.

## Personal Insights
- Kaze expresses strong opinions on game design, critiquing games like Pikmin 2 for lacking player freedom while praising Tears of the Kingdom for its emergent gameplay.
- He is committed to open-sourcing the game *after* its release, partly to avoid leaking the mod and partly due to concerns about Nintendo.
- Kaze shows a resilient and somewhat defiant attitude towards Nintendo's past takedown attempts, stating he's "not really that worried about Nintendo anymore."
- He emphasizes the importance of player experience, often discussing how to make levels feel substantial and mechanics intuitive.
- Kaze values sticking to core Mario gameplay mechanics while innovating, wishing to avoid custom coding that might detract from the Mario feel.
- He openly discusses the challenges of development, including self-doubt about level design ("the overworld feels so small to me now") and the long timeline.

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub:** No relevant information found in this transcript regarding contributions to "Return to Yoshi's Island."
- **Biobak (Graphics Artist):**
    - Significantly contributes to the visual polish of the game. Kaze states Biobak "makes it a lot prettier" by looking over and refining models Kaze creates.
    - Contributes design ideas, such as putting horns on Bowser's office building.
    - Kaze jokingly blames Biobak for a minor issue ("I blame bio back there we go"), indicating a friendly working relationship.
- **Zeina (Animations):**
    - Handles character animations. In the transcript, she asks Kaze if more Bowser animations are needed before she moves on to NPCs.
    - Kaze praises her work: "The animation is done very nicely."
- **Other Contributors:**
    - **Lila (Kaze's wife):** Present during the stream, offers opinions, and Kaze mentions she "usually she's a loudmouth" and "I'm usually just helping him doing stuff." Provides general support.
    - **Chat/Viewers:** Actively provide suggestions for level names, boss ideas, and design solutions, which Kaze engages with and sometimes incorporates.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Level Design (Oil Rig):**
    - Initial concern that the level might feel too small and linear.
    - Solution involved incorporating an "underwater area" (below sea level, viewed through windows) accessible from multiple points to act as a connector and quick travel system, making the overall level feel larger.
    - Designing Bowser's office: iterated from a full castle concept to a tall, secluded tower for performance and thematic reasons.
- **Boss Design (Oil Rig Boss - "Oil Blarg"):**
    - Goal: A "big, fat, burly guy" to act as a strike breaker, preferably from Yoshi's Island.
    - Concept: An oil-based version of a Blargg from Yoshi's Island.
    - Mechanics: The boss swallows platforms. The player fights it using "soap bars" (possibly delivered by a Paratroopa or found in the arena) to "clean" and shrink the boss. The fight involves chasing the boss with soap, and the boss runs away when the player has soap.
    - Arena: Initially considered an underground area with grates for the Blarg to move through, then shifted to the Blarg eating Mario and spitting him out into a separate boss arena.
- **Gameplay Mechanics & Philosophy:**
    - Decision to keep player control focused on Mario's moveset, avoiding over-reliance on custom mechanics like controlling a crane for a boss fight.
    - Cannon camera and reticle needed a remake due to being "atrocious" and broken by other updates.
    - Improving fog and lighting for better visual appeal.
- **Performance:**
    - Conscious of triangle counts and rendering load, leading to design choices like "secluded areas" for complex structures like Bowser's office.
- **Retro Areas:**
    - Decision to remake some older retro areas because they were smaller and less detailed than newer ones.

## Business Aspects
- **Release Timeline:** Estimated to be at least another year and a half away.
- **Distribution:** The game will be released as open source, but only after the full game is out to prevent leaks and potential issues with Nintendo.
- **Monetization:** Kaze makes money from YouTube ad revenue. He mentions having had a Patreon in the past.
- **Nintendo Relations:** Kaze has a history of Nintendo takedowns but seems to have found a way to continue his work, contesting YouTube claims successfully. He acknowledges the risk but is not overly deterred.

## Key Quotes
- "I've decided we're gonna do a little polishing face on return to Yoshi's Island where we're just gonna polish up a bunch of old things..." (Indicates development stage and iterative process)
- "I want the player to control Mario and not a crane? It's kind of one risk when you make a game like this because we have so many options it's very tempting to You know use our custom coding instead of the Mario moveset and I think that often leads to poor romex So I want to avoid that." (Highlights game design philosophy)
- "This is gonna be open source, of course. I Will open sources once it is released but not before because I would just be leaking my entire mod... Also for you know Nintendo Because if you release the source codes, I feel like you can have a lot more trouble with Nintendo..." (Explains release strategy and concerns)
