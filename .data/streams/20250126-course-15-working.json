He discovers a reproducible crash tied to PLJ/BLJ behavior, briefly tests performance on real N64 hardware (~43 FPS with heavy plant geometry), and shares a memory-saving programmable skybox/background technique (\"RainbowPG\"). The stream also includes a strong philosophical tangent about making ROM hacks stand on their own as “real games,” plus thoughts on leaking/open-sourcing and what post-game content could mean.",
