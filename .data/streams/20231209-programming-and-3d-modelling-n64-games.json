Development-wise, he works on Course 11’s retro “8-bit section” inspired by Smash 64’s Board the Platforms: iterating on the signature floating-square background, weighing performance tradeoffs (overdraw/transparency), fixing a rendering/logic bug in rotation direction, and beginning a blockout pass for the platform layout. He also shares broader production context (moved houses, full-time job at Gears for Breakfast, NDA anxiety, remaining world theme plans, and camera-control tuning based on player feedback).",
