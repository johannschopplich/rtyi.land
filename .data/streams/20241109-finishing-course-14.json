He prototypes UI/UX (reset via rocket, no undo), implements/repairs scoring reset logic, chooses a Mario Paint-themed evaluator character, and begins recreating the Mario Paint save/load robot as a 3D model with sprite-accurate proportions. He also discusses an unresolved emulator crash on Parallel RDP, a speculative N64 “hidden memory” concept (9-bit bytes), and the idea of asset-swapping RTYI into an original-IP indie game (with legal uncertainty).",
