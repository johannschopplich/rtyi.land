In parallel, he vents about tooling pain after a Fast64 update broke overworld export behavior and debates Lilaa about the correct technical approach for dynamic material/prop parameter editing without display-list “jump” hacks, concluding he’ll likely implement a pointer/bitmask scanning solution in code.",
