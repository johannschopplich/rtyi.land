In parallel he outlines Course 11’s ‘oil rig’ scenario built around a non-boss Wiggler overseer NPC whose dialogue/animations evolve as the player sabotages workers. The stream also includes workflow/process notes (refactoring ‘magic numbers’ into defines, Blender/Fast64 rigging issues), collaboration with Zeina on animations, mixed playtester reception to the engine, and platform philosophy (N64-compat focus; skepticism of PC-port graphics accuracy).",
