      "outcome": "A leading concept emerges: an Oil Blargg boss fight where Mario uses/collects soap (possibly soap-bar “ride” or soap item) to clean/shrink the boss over multiple phases; Kaze flags remaining implementation questions (soap sourcing, arena transitions, wave collision) but treats this as the likely direction.",
