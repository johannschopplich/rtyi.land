After Biobak delivers a major Course 2 (Dino Dino Domain) visual rework, Kaze imports it, hits a level-load crash, and traces it to a razor-thin out-of-memory condition (about 1KB short) caused by added assets (plus Luigi). He frees memory by removing unused assets and fixing export settings (Bleed/Inline), then cleans up several rendering/material issues while reviewing Biobak’s detailed changelog. Along the way he discusses tutorial placement philosophy, performance targets, and pitches a darker ‘disco ball star’ interaction for the Shy Guy nightclub.",
