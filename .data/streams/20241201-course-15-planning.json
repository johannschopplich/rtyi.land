He clarifies the level’s intended macro-layout (main hub-like space area plus a lower “flipper zone” that launches you back up) and articulates a “Mario Galaxy” approach: spaces that feel open while remaining functionally linear via intersecting paths and warps. The stream also surfaces practical constraints (2D pinball elements don’t translate cleanly to 3D, readability of “bouncy” objects), legal caution around distributing builds, and schedule pressure from a separate commissioned project.",
