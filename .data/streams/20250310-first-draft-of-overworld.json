A major chunk becomes a technical design session: prototyping a ghost-ship ‘fog gate’ that gets denser as the player looks at/approaches the ship, culminating in a fade-to-white + respawn until the lighthouse is activated. He also gives a notable ‘state of the engine’ update (how much is already custom vs vanilla SM64) and discusses commissioned side projects and cautious beta testing to prevent leaks.",

Also reveals business reality: commissioned ROMhack work vs RTY as passion/free."
