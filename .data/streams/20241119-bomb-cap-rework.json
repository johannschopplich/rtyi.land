He adjusts a King Bob-omb-style boss (“Bokwang”) behavior and feedback visuals (orange blink/explosion color), tweaks the fight flow (adds a post-switch wall and an item box), and discusses gating the boss so it won’t respawn once the Bomb Cap is unlocked. He also shares a rough timeline for the next public demo release (tied to upcoming YouTube videos) and experiments with a more advanced per-room lighting/material multiplication approach for a bombable wall asset.",
