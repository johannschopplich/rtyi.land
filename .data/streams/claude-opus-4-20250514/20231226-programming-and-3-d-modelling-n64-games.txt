## Game Development Process
- The game will feature 15 courses total, confirmed to be the same number as the original Mario 64 but with different scale: "How many courses? 15. [...] Mario 64 had 15 courses, but they're all very small."
- Currently working on level design for "Oily Boily Bay" and a Western-themed level (working titles include "Wild West Valley," "Western Wilds," "Cowboy Country," "Cowboy Canyon")
- Development includes creating star mission names, intro cutscenes synced to music, and detailed level geometry
- Using Blender with Fast64 plugin to convert models directly to N64 format: "I can import directly from blender we have a plug-in for that code fast 64 it converts blender models to n64 models"
- Committed to fitting the entire game on a standard 64MB N64 cartridge: "Yes, it is one of my conditions that it fits on a normal N64 cartridge. I'm not gonna go above 64 megabytes."
- The game runs natively on N64 hardware: "No, it's actually native on N64. This runs all on N64, the whole thing."

## Personal Insights
- On game design philosophy: "I have this theory that games are just so goddamn bad that if you make a game that is just not offensive to the player, just like an inoffensive easy platformer with no frustration, no friction, just like easily solvable everything, people will fucking love it."
- Expresses significant frustration with emulator compatibility, particularly Parallel Launcher: "I fucking hate this emulator. Because you guys keep bringing it up. Every time it's brought up, I hate this more. I'm just gonna become the number one parallel launcher hater."
- On the importance of timing cutscenes to music: "The most important part of the cutscene for me is that it's fitting to the music. So, which beat do we cut it on? That's the question."
- Views clothing as non-gifts: "Yeah, but clothing doesn't count. Clothing doesn't count as gifts. Guys, do you agree?"
- On optimization and N64 development: "This is a common mistake in N64 games. The people that made N64 games thought if they just made their stuff low-poly it would run better. And they never actually addressed the real issues that they had in their games."

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: Primary composer for recent levels. "Who made the music for this level? Bad00p. He always makes the music for my levels. Nowadays at least."
- Biobak: Graphics artist working on unfinished areas. "Biobank said he would finish this area. So this is a little unfinished right now." Also mentioned working on underground sections and needing payment through crypto due to PayPal issues.
- Zeina: Working on animations and 3D models during the stream. Created a skull model: "There will be a skull here that Zena is working on right now."
- Other Contributors: 
  - PyroJ (Pyro J): Helped with pipe model design and textures. "He sent me the pipe model a while ago."
  - Mr. Comet: Mentioned in relation to Monster Hunter 64 development

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Implementing a scavenger hunt mechanic with clues: "Mario's goal in this area is gonna be to find the treasure. There's a guy that stands here and He's talking about how there's a treasure hidden and he gives you the first hint"
- Star mission names designed as hints: "Just because we need this to be a hint. Some of these are a little cryptic."
- Consideration for colorblind accessibility when designing colored pipe system: Multiple pipe colors discussed with concern for distinguishability
- Level design philosophy focusing on movement: "I think the idea behind this area really should be like the reason this area would be fun it's just your sick movement there's gonna be some cool ideas thrown in to look at and that's it"
- Avoiding player frustration: "I wonder if this is too difficult. I mean any half-decent player should just be able to jump over there."
- Western level includes themed elements: windmills, tumbleweeds, Koopa bank, sheriff's office with jail, milk bar, train made of dolls

## Business Aspects
- Game must be released for free due to legal concerns: "I unfortunately cannot monetize this I have to release it for free or I will get murdered"
- Game will be open source: "Yes, the game will be open source."
- Payment difficulties with international collaborators: "I want to pay biomic with paper money but people is not letting me use PayPal right now [...] I still need to buy fucking crypto pay crypto fees just to pay biobank"
- Kaze works at Gears for Breakfast as his regular job: "I have a normal job at a game dev and it's gears for breakfast"
- Dual streaming on Twitch and YouTube: "I stream on Twitch and YouTube at the same time now, because Twitch allowed that."
