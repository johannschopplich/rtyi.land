## Game Development Process
- Currently developing Course 13 (ice castle theme), with plans to finalize Courses 14 and 15
- One course already has a finished area with theme set in stone (space arcade for Course 14)
- Creating comprehensive design documents including difficulty curves and level ordering: "I also started doing this. To like give us an overview of the levels. Of like the way the vibe should go and the difficulty. I think we're gonna reorder the levels a little bit to make sure the players learn all the important controls everywhere and that the difficulty has a good curve"
- Experiencing technical issues with Project 64 emulator causing crashes in some levels
- Conducting art style tests and shader experiments for the ice castle level
- Every level includes a retro pipe as a consistent design convention

## Personal Insights
- Streams every Saturday consistently: "I stream every day. Every Saturday"
- Strong preference for Project 64 1.6 over Parallel Launcher: "You can use Parallel Launcher but I hate it. Everyone uses it but I hate it"
- Believes Nintendo programmers weren't skilled enough to code Mario 64 in Assembly: "the Nintendo programmers are not good enough to program Mario 64 in Assembly"
- Views boss fights primarily as cinematic set pieces: "boss fights and video games. They're like zero fun for me. I think I can only appreciate boss fights as a set piece"
- Recommends using ChatGPT for learning game development: "I do recommend using ChatGPT to learn about Unreal Engine or any other game engine you use"
- Prefers Assembly as a programming language: "My favorite is just assembly. The only skilled programming language that actually makes sense to program in"

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: No relevant information found
- Biobak: No relevant information found
- Zeina: Identified as Kaze's wife who contributes art to the project: "my wife still makes art for this." Currently works in her own office separate from Kaze. Also mentioned humorously for accidentally giving Kaze a bad haircut with clippers
- Other Contributors: SimpleFlips - Kaze created a "compact" for them that crashes on most Parallel plugins due to emulator inaccuracies

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Course 13 (ice castle): Designed as "a gloomy ice castle. Like an ice castle where there's a monster and you enter and it's all creepy"
- Course 15 finalized as craft materials theme featuring "paper, cardboard, plastic straws, glue, pipe cleaners, cotton balls, googly eyes, scissors, rulers, ink, paint"
- Rejected day/night cycle mechanic: "The problem is you would end up being in locations where you'd have to wait until the time changes. So that's just not really fun"
- Late-game levels focusing on platforming: "the last levels are all kind of platformy, I think"
- Boss for ice castle potentially Raphael the Raven on top of tower with moon in background
- Design philosophy against puzzles: "Puzzles is very much against the design of this game"
- Maintaining convention of retro pipes in every level: "there's a side-level, a retro-pipe in every level. But breaking that convention, that feels like breaking a promise to the player"

## Business Aspects
- Received sponsorship samples from Gamer Soup: "I have like 15 of these that Gamersub gave me. They were like test these to see if they're any good so we can sponsor you"
- Received gaming-targeted pre-workout samples called "Just Melon" with anime-style packaging for potential sponsorship
- Notes that Gamer Soup is "literally just repackaged instant noodles" with "500% markup"

## Key Quotes
- "For me, the number one priority when we make a boss is to make sure it's a cool set piece"
- "This is the last level. We want this to be kinda special. We want it to be something that allows for difficulty as well. It should alter some convention that all the other 30 levels follow"
- "Starting on a new level is always the most difficult thing because there's so many things you have to keep in mind to try and make it look good"

## Potential Interview Topics
- The creative process behind designing the final levels and how they differ from earlier courses
- The technical challenges of working with N64 ROM hacking and emulator compatibility
- The collaborative process with Zeina and how art direction influences level design
- The philosophy behind avoiding puzzles and focusing on platforming in a Yoshi-themed game
- The balance between honoring source material (Yoshi's Island) while creating something unique and avoiding repetition of existing ROM hacks
