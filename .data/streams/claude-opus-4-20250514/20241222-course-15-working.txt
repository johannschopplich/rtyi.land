## Game Development Process
- Currently preparing a demo release with Course 15 (space/arcade themed level) as a secret level that most players won't unlock
- Game is running at 22-25 FPS in worst-case scenarios on actual N64 hardware, which Kaze considers acceptable
- Actively programming new gameplay objects including warp platforms with custom animations and low gravity zones
- The game will be "almost 64 megabytes" with Kaze stating "I have 64 megabytes, I can use all of them. So I'm gonna use all of them to make the game better"
- Development approach involves creating objects first, then experimenting with placement: "I just start moving it around and see what's fun. And then we just keep whatever turned out to be fun"

## Personal Insights
- "I hate video games" - Kaze expresses frustration with the medium while simultaneously creating them
- On game difficulty: "I would say a lot of the platforming is more difficult. But the movement is so much more consistent. And it just works. So it kinda balances out"
- Prefers targeted playtesting: "Personally, what I do is I send demos of the game just to one person and have them tested and I do that over and over and that works very well"
- Cultural observation about greetings: "When someone asks you, hello, how are you? You have to say, good, how are you? You can't say, oh, actually, today was kind of a bad day"
- On adding extremely difficult content: "I like putting super hard things in my games. That you can only get at the very end. That most players wouldn't encounter"

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: No specific mentions in this stream transcript
- Biobak: Described as "reworking all my stuff anyway" regarding textures and art, indicating ongoing visual refinement
- Zeina: Created a carpet texture that Kaze incorporated and likes, asking chat "what do you think of the carpet? I made this earlier today. I like it a lot"
- Other Contributors:
  - Wiseguy: Mentioned as potential collaborator for N64 Recomp technology
  - UAD: Described as "a person I work with a lot" who has played Tonic Trouble
  - Melon/Brodude: Running a successful Kickstarter for their N64-style game

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Implementing warp platforms without transparency due to material limitations: "I don't want to re-enable transparency on Mario's model, because it would mess with all my components"
- Creating a space/arcade aesthetic with "light beams shining out of it, and the light beams move around in a colorful" way
- Struggling with platform color choices to avoid blending with backgrounds: "I need to somehow make this not blend into the background"
- Balancing visual polish with development efficiency: "We want to avoid doing unnecessary work when we can"
- Designing levels with eight red coins "mostly below the thing here" as collectibles

## Business Aspects
- Considering dual release strategy: "What if, along with RTYI, I also release a game that is 90% the same content, but we replace all the Nintendo IP with our own? That is the idea. And that way we would legally own it"
- Potential Steam release: "I would maybe be able to use Recom to sell it on Steam or something. It's hypothetical"
- Observing market data from Brodude's Kickstarter: "$250 per backer? This is like insane data. I need to keep this in mind"
- Demo release timing consideration: "It's probably not going to be for Christmas because Robot is releasing this for like Christmas and I don't want to ruin his release"
- Market observation: "Didn't think there was so much demand for N64-like games"

## Key Quotes
- "If we do that. I don't know that we'll do it. For now, just chill." - On potential music collaboration
- "Game design is tough. Um, no. Maybe. It's one of those things that's more difficult the more difficult the competition is, and video games are fucking awful, which means the competition is not very strong."
- "First, I make an outline of the things I want in the level. Then I think about how I can make the level fun in the way that I envision. And then I program all the stuff that I want for that."

## Potential Interview Topics
- The decision-making process behind creating both a ROM hack and a potential original IP version for commercial release
- How collaborators like Biobak and Zeina contribute to the visual identity of RTYI and the workflow for integrating their contributions
- The technical challenges of optimizing a modern game design to run on 25-year-old hardware while maintaining playability
- The influence of market data (like Kickstarter performance) on development and release strategies
- The philosophy behind difficulty design and how "more difficult platforming but more consistent movement" creates a balanced experience
