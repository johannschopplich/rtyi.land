## Game Development Process
- Currently finishing shaders/combiners for the overworld sections and preparing to move to the next part
- Game has been in development for nearly 5 years ("I think we haven't quite finished five years of development yet. But I think we're close")
- Preparing course 4 for beta testing with a single beta tester initially ("The beta test being me sending the ROM to one person, meaning 99.9% of you guys will not see it")
- Self-imposed limit of exactly 64 megabytes for the final ROM
- Working on base visuals including corals, volcano textures, and cave elements
- Development is constrained by Kaze having a full-time job and needing to make YouTube videos

## Personal Insights
- "I will openly admit I have absolutely no talent for art like that... I'm just good at hitting buttons fast"
- "I do think, skill-wise, I'm at least a top 2% or 3% programmer. Knowledge-wise, probably not"
- Critical of original Mario 64 code: "the code I've seen in Mario 64 is below average, unfortunately. Even though I love the game"
- Views YouTube as necessary income: "I will make a video if I must. And I must make videos to earn money"
- Has a daughter but prefers not to show her on stream
- Works full-time in Unreal Engine 5 game development alongside this project

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: No relevant information found in this transcript
- Biobak/Biobank: Graphics artist who will rework levels after Kaze establishes base shaders and concepts ("Bioware is gonna rework some of this anyway")
- Zeina: Working on animations, specifically asked about making the skip button functionality for cutscenes
- Other Contributors: 
  - Akumoid/Accumart: Created shaders with Kaze, including a reflective shader effect
  - Community members: Created the Fast64 plugin being used
  - Unnamed video editor: Edits Kaze's YouTube videos
  - Single beta tester: Will receive early ROM for testing

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Implementing innovative cutscene skip: Hold A button for 30 frames with visual feedback circle (like Breath of the Wild)
- Bunny burrow entrance designed to be inviting with flowers and plants, blocked by Pachyderm character requiring 10 coins or ground pound
- "Really, the one thing we want to maximize with the overworld is the feeling of aliveness and placeness"
- No level nameplates in overworld: "That makes the overworld feel very gamey and I want this to feel placey"
- Fixed "all this stupid annoying stuff from the vanilla game"
- Star placement intentionally out of reach to create mystery
- Plans for characters from levels to appear in overworld after completion

## Business Aspects
- YouTube monetization strategy: "I ended up like, paying someone to make videos for me. As in like, the editing... And now I actually make way more money from YouTube videos, because I have sponsors"
- Uses agency to find sponsors for YouTube channel
- Channel has become "commercialized" but allows for more video production
- Game release timeline: "It'll definitely come out before 2030, I think"
- Jokingly discussed gambling sponsorship offer

## Key Quotes
- "I have fixed all this stupid annoying stuff from the vanilla game. You guys want to know how to actually get that star? I'm not telling you. But I can tell you it's not from here."
- "I think when you take combined time into account, I've spent, or I will have spent less time on RTYI than Mario 64 team has spent on Mario 64."
- "Being in the future for sure helps, but that doesn't mean that every single improvement ever is just because you're from the future. Like, there could legitimately be a skill difference."

## Potential Interview Topics
1. The five-year development journey: How has the project evolved from initial concept to near-completion, and what were the major turning points?
2. Balancing commercial work with passion projects: How does working full-time in Unreal Engine 5 influence or contrast with N64 ROM hack development?
3. The collaborative process: How does working with artists like Biobak transform the initial technical implementations into polished visuals?
4. Design philosophy of "aliveness and placeness": What specific techniques are being used to make the overworld feel like a living place rather than a game level?
5. Technical innovation within constraints: How do you push the boundaries of N64 hardware while maintaining the 64MB limit and ensuring compatibility?
