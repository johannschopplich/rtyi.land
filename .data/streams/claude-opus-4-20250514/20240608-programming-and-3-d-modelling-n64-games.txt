## Game Development Process
- Planning to release a new demo featuring just course one to gather feedback on physics and camera: "I'm thinking what we should do is make another demo with just course one and then we use that to get Feedback on the physics and the camera"
- Currently working on course 11 (Oily Boily Bay) with major visual overhaul from collaborator
- Game has been in development for multiple years; Kaze defends the timeline by comparing to Mario Odyssey: "Mario Odyssey came out in like 2017 and there's not been a new mainline Mario game since then And they've been working on that like three years longer than me"
- Multiple levels/areas in various stages of completion (factory, office, underwater sections)
- Iterative development process with constant refinement based on team input

- Strong opinions on color theory and visual design: "I hate this They say it's like the opposites of this... The point of what you're making is not to just Pick random colors the point of what you're making is do you think of an emotion"
- Pride in the game's movement mechanics: "Dude, the movement in this game feels so good to me now. It's so fun to just move around"
- Philosophy against false humility: "I would actually go so far as to say that acting humble is a coward's tactic"
- Personal approach to visuals: "I can do visuals is like mostly through like rational thinking and computation I can't just wipe it out it doesn't work for me"
- Strong vision for creative control: "I Genuinely believe me making every single decision ever is better than democracy for everyone involved, especially me"
