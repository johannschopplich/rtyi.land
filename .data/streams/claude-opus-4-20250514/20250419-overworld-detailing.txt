## Game Development Process
- Currently working on completely remaking Mario 64's sound engine - now 80% faster than vanilla, uses quarter of the code size, needs much less memory, and supports 32 notes instead of 16
- No more demos planned: "I don't think there will be another demo. The next release will be the full game"
- Working on the overworld level design which will be "the biggest level ever" with approximately 30 stars
- The project has evolved significantly: "originally I didn't even make this mod for the optimization. The optimization just kind of happened because I felt too limited by the hardware"
- Still has "so many levels for Biobank to rework" indicating ongoing visual development

## Personal Insights
- Reflects on the project's public perception: "it's kind of weird to me that this whole project became so much about optimization in the public eye. But I guess it was bound to happen. That's just what did well on YouTube, and that's why I kept engaging with that"
- Philosophy on game endings: "You know what I kind of don't like in video games? The fact that you spend the whole video game saving the world. But then once you save the world, you're not allowed to explore the saved world... I want the player to save the world and then be like, yep, this is the world now. You saved it"
- On time management: "Honestly, it's not that hard to find time for this stuff. If you think about your day-to-day, I'm sure you'll find that you waste most of your free time"
- Commitment to finishing projects: "But so far I've always finished my hacks. So I'm very confident this one is going to get done soon"

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: No specific mentions in this transcript
- Biobak: "Biobank is making a lot of custom textures but not literally every texture is custom. However, in the end I probably will have to make every texture custom" - working extensively on visual assets
- Zeina: Mentioned as Kaze's wife; they started talking in early 2020, she visited Germany a year later, and Kaze moved to Canada in November 2021 to be with her
- Other Contributors:
  - 0VALT: Working on overworld music - "And this is the current version that 0VALT is working on right now" with mention of 12-15 different songs for the overworld
  - DeathWizard: Created a Tetris game as a valid MIDI sequence in Mario 64
  - Draco: Commissioned work on "Draco's Mario" which is finished pending commissioner approval
  - UV mapping plugin contributor: Biobank sent a UV mapping plugin to help with development

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Major sound engine challenges: "During this stream, you might hear some sound bugs. I am still working on fixing those"
- Overworld design complexity: Working on separating different areas (Yoshi Village, Bowser section) while avoiding empty space
- Post-game innovation: "I think it would be extremely cool if in this game, for a change, after you save the world, it doesn't reset your save file. It's just you are in the world and the world is saved"
- Technical limitations driving design: The optimization focus emerged because "I felt too limited by the hardware"
- Level sketching process: "I always sketch my level first" before implementation

## Business Aspects
- YouTube monetization strategy: "I know the videos are coming fast recently. It is because I find sponsors and sponsors make videos for us and will pay you a lot of money"
- Release timing concerns: "The thing is I can't release this around the same time as Nintendo releases anything... Because if I do they will literally kill me"
- Legal considerations: "If I want this to all be legal, I would technically need custom textures for everything. But that's something for later if I actually do want to make this a legal game or something"
- Upcoming content: Planning a video about RNG in Mario 64 with various thumbnail and title options
- Financial needs: "I could really use more money though" - mentioned while discussing his day job as a programmer
