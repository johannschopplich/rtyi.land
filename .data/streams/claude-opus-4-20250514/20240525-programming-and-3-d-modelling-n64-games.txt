## Game Development Process
- Currently in the level design phase, placing platforming mechanics throughout the level to create engaging gameplay
- Made significant progress since last stream: added platforming mechanics, bridges, doors, and visual effects
- Working on quest/level 13, which appears to be an ice/snow themed castle level
- The game is a ROM hack based on Mario 64 decompilation
- Using iterative design process - constantly testing ideas in-game and refining based on how they feel
- Plans to theme rooms differently after platforming is finalized (lobby, dining room, library)

## Personal Insights
- "How fucking cool is that? You can't tell me that this is not the coolest thing ever" - expressing excitement about visual effects
- "I literally never want to update my software ever unless there is something wrong with it cause everytime software updates it introduces new bugs"
- Considering switching to Linux due to Windows 11 concerns: "The shit in Windows 11 just seems too bad"
- "I really just want to finish this game here and then I can move on to that [making own games]"
- Strong preference against puzzles: wants to focus on platforming mechanics
- Values interconnected level design where "every path kind of leads to a goal"

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: No relevant information found in this transcript
- Biobak: Graphics artist who may have added triangles to a 3D model (mentioned briefly when Kaze notices duplicate triangles)
- Zeina: Present during the stream (possibly in same location), consulted on aesthetic decisions like whether objects should be low poly or smooth. Appears to be working on animations/graphics. At one point was "taking the house apart" according to Kaze
- Other Contributors: 
  - Lila/Leela: Active community member providing level design suggestions, had "the banger idea today"
  - Samah: Provided graphical tips during stream about visual improvements
  - Fast64 developers: Created the tool for converting Blender models to N64 format

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Major design challenge: Creating a mechanic where players see a frozen star immediately upon entering but can't reach it until later
- Explored multiple solutions: swinging chandelier, cannon, rolling snowball - ultimately chose the snowball mechanic as most thematic
- Implementing interconnected level design with multiple paths leading to different stars
- Boss fight design: Raven boss on castle top with dramatic moon reveal ("slowly from the bottom you see like a shadow come up and the moon is slowly being hidden")
- Created custom seamless snowflake pattern for visual effects
- Balancing visual appeal with gameplay functionality
- Planning for memory limitations rather than performance issues

## Business Aspects
- "This will be pretty insane advertisement for whenever I do my own game"
- "Marketing seems to be basically like 90% of the equation in making a game"
- Code repository currently private, considering making it public with future mini hack releases
- Already works professionally in Unreal Engine 5 game development

## Key Quotes
- "I invented this pattern. I needed a seamless snowflake pattern that repeats... I love how this looks this is such a cool pattern I invented"
- "The theming should be secondary to the gameplay"
- "I want that when you enter the level, I want you to immediately see the first star... it's supposed to like stick in your minds and then like you go through the mansion and you find a way to get to the star eventually"

## Potential Interview Topics
- The creative process behind designing interconnected levels with multiple paths and how this philosophy developed
- The balance between technical limitations (memory constraints) and creative vision in ROM hacking
- The role of community feedback and live development in shaping the game
- The transition from ROM hacking to original game development and how this project serves as preparation
- The collaborative process with artists and animators, particularly how aesthetic decisions are made collectively
