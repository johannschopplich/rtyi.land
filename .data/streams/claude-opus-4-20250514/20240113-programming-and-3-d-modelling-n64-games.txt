## Game Development Process
- Currently developing "Return to Yoshi's Island," a ROM hack based on Mario 64 decompilation
- Working on course 5 (pirate ship level) which was originally created three years ago and is now being reworked
- Using a custom optimized engine that will be released publicly when the hack is complete: "when i release this hack my engine will be public i'll make the hack open source like all of it at the same time"
- Has released multiple ROM hacks previously (mentions ranking them in a tier list)
- Development process is highly iterative with levels being refined over years
- Streams development on both Twitch and YouTube simultaneously

## Personal Insights
- Values atmospheric design over mechanical difficulty: "Difficulty here is unnecessary... This is not good because this is a hard puzzle to figure out. This is good because we are showing a cool idea to the player"
- Critical of modern software practices: "I would still be using windows 7 if it was a viable option" (due to privacy concerns)
- Controversial opinion on programmer productivity: "I think programmers in a 35 hour work week, they just work 10 hours. I feel like programmers are the laziest people on the planet"
- Dislikes traditional art forms: "I don't like paintings at all I'm a painting hater. I don't like that like paintings are synonymous with art. I think that's stupid"
- Believes in showing players clever mechanics rather than hiding them behind difficulty

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: Composer who submitted a saloon song that was "too upbeat and happy" and too similar to the zoo level music. Kaze noted it didn't match the darker atmosphere he wanted for the western saloon
- Biobak (also called Biomech/Biobank): Graphics artist who provided extensive rework of the pirate ship level, including "ray-traced gems," improved lighting, new textures, and atmospheric elements. Created detailed changelog in Blender file documenting all changes
- Zeina: No information found in this transcript
- Other Contributors: An unnamed Twitter user who sent a cactus model for the western level

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Technical limitations heavily influence design: "applying the clear color takes around three milliseconds which is like 10 percent of the render time of a frame"
- Challenge of writing meaningful dialogue for numerous NPCs: "how do we give all of them semi-relevant text i don't want to add npcs that then are just gonna not contribute to the game fun"
- Environmental storytelling through interactive elements: "this jail cell slowly fills up as you collect stars which i think is even better"
- Dealing with N64 texture format limitations and rendering layer constraints
- Debugging crashes caused by geometry changes and invalid vertex iterations
- Balancing visual quality with performance on original hardware

## Business Aspects
- Shares custom engine with select ROM hackers but won't publicly release until the game is complete to prevent early leaks
- Maintains presence on multiple platforms (Twitch, YouTube, "Case Clips" YouTube channel)
- Jokingly mentioned: "make sure to uh buy my energy drinks"
- No serious discussion of monetization or distribution found

## Key Quotes
- "when i release this hack my engine will be public i'll make the hack open source like all of it at the same time"
- "This is not good because this is a hard puzzle to figure out. This is good because we are showing a cool idea to the player, and the player is like, oh, that's neat. My brain is expanding"
- "Bethesda puzzles are look at the item in your inventory. Which, how the fuck would you even think to do that?"

## Potential Interview Topics
- The three-year evolution of individual levels and how the vision has changed over time
- The collaborative process with remote artists and managing creative differences
- Technical innovations in pushing N64 hardware beyond original limitations
- Philosophy on game difficulty and player experience in ROM hacks
- The decision to open-source the entire project and its potential impact on the ROM hacking community
