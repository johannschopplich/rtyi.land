## Game Development Process
- Significant progress made on a Western/cowboy-themed level featuring tumbleweeds, various buildings, and a functional train
- Performance testing shows level running at 40-50 fps before optimization, indicating active performance monitoring
- Structured development approach: "before we can reasonably program the train, we need the train tracks to work fine"
- Regular streaming sessions showing iterative development and community engagement
- Using both N64 references and modern game assets (Mario Kart 7) for inspiration

## Personal Insights
- Deep commitment to thematic consistency: "my dedication to the cowboy theme is still big, I started only watching cowboy tv shows while working on this, I am literally watching westworld right now"
- Creative humor as a design principle: "this is gonna be the tumbleweed store, there's gonna be just a shady seller here selling tumbleweed, I think that idea is fucking hilarious"
- Concern about audience reception: "I thought it's like my favorite video ever, but people don't seem to watch it much"
- Philosophy on avoiding controversy: "I will not have racist native american stereotypes on this cover... there's no reason to have random political controversy"
- Strong opinions on game design philosophy, particularly regarding intrinsic vs extrinsic motivation in games

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Choosing between authentic N64 train design vs enhanced Mario Kart 7 version: "I actually don't want this to be the exact same train now that I think about it"
- Creating detailed Western town with specific buildings: sheriff's office with wanted posters, cowboy store, "Big Iron" gun store (cork guns only), tumbleweed store, bank, saloon, and unagi oil store
- Technical challenge with texture resolution: struggling to create proper 3D-looking "64" logo for the train
- Design philosophy of maximum cowboy theme: "we move to the cowboy slider all the way to the right And then we keep going"
- Interactive elements: tumbleweeds that can be kicked, train that moves on tracks every 10 seconds, gold bullions as decorative elements

## Business Aspects
- YouTube analytics concerns: "11% impression click rate. Why is the video doing so poorly? Everyone's watching this. Everyone's clicking this. Why is it doing poorly?"
- Algorithm analysis: "The YouTube algorithm detected, hey, this video is not Mario64. This is not what its audience usually watches"
- Prediction of video performance: "my prediction is going to be that right now it's doing poorly. But in 24 hours, it's going to do insanely well"
- Using both Twitch and YouTube simultaneously for streaming

## Key Quotes
- "I'm doing that to american culture the cowboys We want to just a hundred percent cowboy this like we we move to the cowboy slider all the way to the right And then we keep going"
- "I think superhero movies are like this symbol for consumerism to me Like the symbol for meaningless garbage fast food art"
- "Time is limited. We're all slowly dying. I gotta make what I can."
