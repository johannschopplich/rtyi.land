## Game Development Process
- Currently in active level design phase, with significant progress made since last stream ("it's gonna be quite a few changes to the level since I last streamed")
- Moving from design to programming phase soon ("And then we basically have all the platforming done and we can start programming it")
- Level features multiple biomes: grasslands, mountains, desert, with considerations for castle and ice areas
- Development appears rapid due to craft material aesthetic ("this course was really fast to do because it's made out of simple craft materials")
- Working on implementing custom normal map support for N64 ("The N64 does not have normal map support. I added the support")

## Personal Insights
- Strong preference for self-directed learning over tutorials ("I do not like the donut tutorial. I'm the number 1 donut tutorial hater")
- Wants amateur/handmade aesthetic rather than professional look ("We do want this to be a craft a level but we don't want this to be expertly crafted")
- Has long-standing aversion to 2D drawing ("I Remember on the last day of elementary school My teacher was like look how far you've come... And I said I still hate it. I'm just doing it. So you leave me alone")
- Values dynamic lighting and visual effects for recognizability ("that makes them a lot more recognizable")
- Humorous self-awareness about texture hunting ("How come almost every stream I do just devolves into looking for textures? Is this just how I'm built?")

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: Composer creating most of the music ("but it was making most of the music")
- Biobak: Graphics artist helping rework levels ("biobank is helping me rework some of my levels")
- Zeina: Mentioned in context of watching anime together and previous game testing ("So, how would a paper umbrella look like here")
- Other Contributors: 
  - Lila: Active community member providing real-time feedback during stream
  - Anonymous artist: Created Yoshi doodle artwork ("I Made a Yoshi do not wait... It's up to your standards")

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Implemented custom normal mapping on N64 hardware despite lack of native support
- Craft world aesthetic using paper, cardboard, styrofoam, crayons, popsicle sticks, paper plates for mushrooms
- Enemy design focusing on craft-appropriate versions (cardboard Womps, Thwomps, saw blades made from cardboard)
- Technical constraints requiring creative solutions (texture orientation limitations, polygon count considerations)
- Level design includes multiple objectives: escort missions with crayons, red coin sections, silver stars via paper plane
- Struggling with making ice/snow areas work within craft aesthetic, considering switching to castle theme

## Business Aspects
- Has Patreon and StreamLabs for viewer support
- Received $50 donation during stream
- No explicit release plans or marketing strategy mentioned
- No discussion of pricing or distribution

## Key Quotes
- "The N64 does not have normal map support. I added the support. The texture is computed on the CPU."
- "We do want this to be a craft a level but we don't want this to be expertly crafted... Like if I was doodling a Yoshi it would look similar to that"
- "How come almost every stream I do just devolves into looking for textures? Is this just how I'm built? Do I just look for textures all the time? Am I doomed to roam this earth just looking for textures all my life?"

## Potential Interview Topics
- The technical achievement of implementing normal maps on N64 hardware and how this enhances the craft material aesthetic
- The creative process behind choosing craft materials as the game's visual theme and how it influences level design
- Collaboration dynamics with remote team members (Badub, Biobak) and how work is divided
- The balance between personal artistic vision and community feedback during live development streams
- The influence of games like Paper Mario and Yoshi's Story on the game's aesthetic and design philosophy
