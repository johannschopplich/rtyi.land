## Game Development Process
- Currently in active development phase, working on establishing art style for an ice castle level with collaborator Biobak
- Have planned 5 out of 6 required stars for the level, with additional ideas in progress
- Rewrote a new OS for N64 that's "quite a bit better" and provides more control for optimizations
- Planning to model the castle in 3D in upcoming streams after finalizing room layouts
- Considering dual release on both PC and N64 simultaneously for marketing impact

## Personal Insights
- Shows confidence in design decisions: "I do like this, though. I think you might just be wrong, CXLinks"
- Committed to open source: "Despite what people seem to think I will release the source code. I don't know why people think I don't. I literally even released the source code for Peach's Fury"
- Views the project as creating specific atmospheres: "It's kind of like an eerie ice castle... Kind of a lonely world for Mario, with a lot of enemies"
- Takes a collaborative but decisive approach: "But he had some neat ideas and I had some neat ideas"
- Maintains humor during development, joking about being "evil" for making challenging content

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: Composer working on music, specifically mentioned excitement about "oil level sub areas" that will "go hard"
- Biobak: Graphics artist actively collaborating on art style development, created texture materials that Kaze refined and implemented
- Zeina: Animator who created "icy bricks combiner" and is working on raven enemy animations; also mentioned as Kaze's wife
- Other Contributors: No additional major contributors mentioned in this transcript

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Ice castle design inspired by Tick Tock Clock's atmosphere - "eerie" and "lonely"
- Technical challenge with texture quantization: "Mario 64 only has five bits [for color]... especially for alpha, we only have one bit for alpha"
- Innovative room concepts: cold haze rooms with damage over time, ice wave generators for platforming, spinning ice platforms that redirect wall jumps
- Castle layout designed as U-shaped structure with labyrinthine paths that branch and reconnect
- Implementing reflective ice textures using camera-dependent scrolling effects to simulate reflections within N64 limitations

## Business Aspects
- Plans to release source code: "Yes the source code will release"
- Considering simultaneous PC and N64 release: "if you make a game that releases on both N64 and PC at the same time, that's some insane advertising"
- Joking timeline references: "2031 compared to some other remakes wouldn't even be that bad"
- Previous release of Peach's Fury source code mentioned as precedent
- No specific funding or marketing details discussed

## Key Quotes
- "I want you to think about levels like Tick Tock Clock, when you think about this here. In terms of how the vibe is."
- "I was working with Biobak off-stream to try and find an art style for this. We were working very actively. But he had some neat ideas and I had some neat ideas."
- "Did I tell you guys that I wrote a new OS for my N64? It's all done now, it's all good... And it gives me a lot more control. We're gonna find a lot of optimizations with the new OS."

## Potential Interview Topics
- The collaborative process between Kaze and Biobak in establishing the visual style for levels
- Technical innovations like the N64 OS rewrite and how it enables new possibilities within hardware limitations
- The design philosophy behind creating atmospheric, "lonely" levels that challenge players
- The decision-making process for dual PC/N64 release and its potential impact
- How the team balances creative vision with N64 hardware constraints, particularly regarding texture formats and visual effects
