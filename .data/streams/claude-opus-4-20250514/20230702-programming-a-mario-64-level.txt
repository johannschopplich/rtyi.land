## Game Development Process
- Currently in advanced development stage focusing on polish and optimization: "I have prepared a lot of stuff that we need to do in order to get multiplayer in. Some code. Found some minor performance improvements. Made the game more stable. Added some new functionalities."
- Implementing monthly course testing system: "we are bringing back monthly testing so i'm gonna prepare one course a month and we're gonna have one person test the course just like a rom with just the one level in it and hopefully we can analyze the gameplay"
- Multiplayer implementation is a major upcoming milestone: "I wanna get multiplayer implemented before we do the Worms Fortress HD demo. Just so people actually can play the multiplayer."
- Currently working on 15 main courses (30 total including variations)
- Transitioning between animation formats and dealing with technical updates

## Personal Insights
- Strong philosophy against modern "frustration-free" game design: "i take a lot more risk in my game than like what you would see in a nintendo game... modern video games are just like frustration minimized they like design themselves in a way that there's no risk to anything"
- Values honest feedback over politeness: "If your level is shit and people tell you it's shit, you should still be happy that at least someone's telling you it's shit. That's better than people just being nice for no reason."
- Preference for authenticity: "I don't really care about charity so I'm not even going to make a video pretending about it. I don't like just pretending to care when I don't."
- Compares modern games to "scrolling tiktok" - mediocre but inoffensive content
- Believes in maintaining challenge and risk in game design

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: No relevant information found in this transcript
- Biobak: Extensively reworked zoo level models including improved textures, UV mapping, lighting, and environmental details. Added decorative elements like signs ("Please feed the animals" as a joke about Mario's cheapness), updated aquarium areas, created custom coin pile textures, and improved overall visual coherence. Works iteratively with Kaze who provides feedback on implementations.
- Zeina: Creating animations for Wario including a dance animation and run cycle. Made butt print texture for ground pounding mechanics. Briefly entertained stream viewers with MS Paint drawings when Kaze stepped away. Uses IK rig created by Yoshi Milkman for animation work.
- Other Contributors: 
  - Yoshi Milkman: Created IK rig used for animations
  - Jonas: Team member on their next (NDA-protected) project
  - Various community members providing feedback and testing

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Implemented smoother level transitions: "You see how the transition pops in from the side all the way instead of instantly being there?"
- Intentionally maintaining difficulty in flying minigame: "The fact that you get stuck in shit for several seconds is what makes it harder"
- Dealing with Fast64 updates breaking existing models and animations
- Balancing visual improvements with performance (texture loading, polygon counts)
- Making collision maps for all new models
- Addressing UV mapping issues and material optimization
- Design philosophy of having "achievements" in Antarctic level that don't affect gameplay but provide recognition

## Business Aspects
- Commitment to open source: "the engine will be completely open source. The entire hack here will be open source."
- Currently under NDA for next commercial project: "I'm literally legally not allowed to tell you anything about the game"
- Plans for public demo before full release
- Using community testing to refine gameplay before release
- Streaming development process for community engagement

## Key Quotes
- "I think modern video games are just like frustration minimized... there's no risk that any player could get stuck on anything and everything is like super easy to get through... but just a bunch of mediocre shit and I guess people will like it so I try not to do that"
- "If I spend all my time checking my code, then I just have no time left... The lazy thing to do would be to check everything. To just play around in your game. The non-lazy thing is to actually just remember."
- "I want my games to take the risks of just like oh there's a risk something doesn't work out for the player right away there's a risk that they get stuck somewhere and have to struggle at all to get past the obstacle"

## Potential Interview Topics
- The philosophy of embracing difficulty and "risk" in game design versus modern accessibility trends
- The collaborative workflow between programmer and artists - how are visual updates integrated and iterated upon?
- Technical challenges of implementing multiplayer functionality in a ROM hack environment
- The role of community feedback and monthly testing in shaping the final game experience
- Balancing faithfulness to Mario 64's original design with innovative new features like multiplayer and custom mechanics
