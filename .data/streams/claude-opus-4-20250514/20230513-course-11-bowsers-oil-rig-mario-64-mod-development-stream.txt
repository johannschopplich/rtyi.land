## Game Development Process
- Currently working on Course 11 out of a planned 15 courses total
- Major theme change from volcano to oil rig/industrial setting for this level
- Game is tentatively titled "Return to Yoshi's Island 64"
- Development includes creating 6 missions per level with different objectives
- Focus on 3D modeling and platform design during this stream
- Iterative design process shown through willingness to completely change direction

## Personal Insights
- Expresses frustration with modern games lacking freedom: "I feel like there are so many video games where there is no solution right off the bat... it's like I'm not even playing, I'm actually just following instructions I've laid out myself"
- Shows strong design philosophy: "designing something is not just about coming up with ideas it's about solving whatever problem you have in design"
- Demonstrates perfectionist tendencies and resistance to random suggestions from viewers
- Reflects on feeling less free in video games as he's gotten older
- Values thematic consistency in level naming (alliterations, rhymes)

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: No relevant information found in this transcript
- Biobak: No relevant information found in this transcript
- Zeina: Working on animations for the game; Kaze mentions waiting for animations for an end cutscene that "took a while"
- Other Contributors: 
  - Rionu: Described as persistent about wanting to translate the game ("there's this really annoying guy called Rionu, and he just won't leave me alone, and he says he's going to translate that")

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Major pivot from volcano theme to oil rig theme: "the whole volcano theme is gone now"
- Level concept: "this is going to be a level full of bowser's minions working here and you're gonna be messing with them basically"
- Multiple mission structure including: workers on strike, operating a crane to destroy a Bowser statue, power generator area, and underwater sections
- Technical concerns about polygon count: "This level is going to be very high poly. This level is going to absolutely murder the triangles"
- Struggling with platform design that is both visually appealing and functional for gameplay
- Planning to use ocean spires/mountains as major structural elements

## Business Aspects
- Concerns about game searchability: "i'm planning to call it return to yoshi's island 64 that's the current name but like it might not be the most searchable name"
- Awareness of release timing risks: Discussion about another ROM hack releasing near "Brother Wild" with comment that "nintendo also has a habit of going after romex right after they release their own games"
- Multi-language support being considered due to translation interest

## Key Quotes
- "Now that we switch to the oil rig theming we need some new platform ideas this is going to be a bit difficult to pull off"
- "I don't want random ideas, guys. If you have random ideas, that is great and all and you are free to be creative. But like the probability of me actually putting any of them in is very slim."
- "Me and Zeyna, we went out and we made a cool... We made a terrarium in a closed jar."

## Potential Interview Topics
1. The evolution of level themes - what drives major changes like switching from volcano to oil rig mid-development?
2. Balancing technical limitations (polygon counts) with creative vision in ROM hack development
3. The role of community input in development and how to filter suggestions while maintaining creative control
4. Collaboration process with team members like Zeina for animations - how does remote collaboration work?
5. Strategic considerations for ROM hack releases - timing, naming, and avoiding Nintendo's attention
