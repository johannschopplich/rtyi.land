## Game Development Process
- Currently working on Course 14, a craft/paper-themed level featuring styrofoam platforms, paper snowballs, and matchbox bridges
- The game is "already in the last three areas" of development, suggesting significant progress
- Demo release planned for "a few weeks" after completing videos about BLJ and channel content
- Game contains "about four times as much content" compared to the original, with playtime estimated to be "80% longer"
- Levels now feature 7 acts each (expanded from vanilla Mario 64's structure)
- Close to completing the "Paper Luigi mission" during this stream

## Personal Insights
- "my priority today is not on entertaining but rather on getting work done which you know it always is but this time even more so" - Shows focus on productivity over entertainment value
- "I'm so glad we don't have a payment deadline" - Suggests freedom from financial pressure
- Shared story about responding to Nintendo DMCA with profanity: "I responded to the email with just suck my cock" (with character substitution) - demonstrates defiant attitude toward legal threats
- Integration of personal life (baby appearance, workout breaks) shows indie developer lifestyle
- "I'm just very passionate" - explaining his reaction to stupid questions

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: No specific mentions in this transcript
- Biobak/Biobank: Graphics artist who provides feedback on visual elements. Kaze specifically asks "Biobank what do you think of the new styrofoam? your opinion here matters"
- Zeina/Zeyna: Animator who will create proper textures for matchbox brands. "I might ask Zeyna to make a good version of it" and "hopefully Zeyna will make a decent one that is better than what I'm making here"
- Other Contributors: Unnamed person from showcase channel who created a "2000 polygon box" exclamation box model with pre-rendered textures

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Major coin system overhaul: "red coins in this game are always contained to one area because otherwise red coins suck" and Yoshi coins reward "really rare special interactions"
- Removed 100-coin stars entirely: "no level has a 100 coin star not a single one"
- Added 7th act with egg coin radar system for exploration
- Technical challenge making wool/cotton textures look good on N64: "making wool on the n64 look good difficult"
- Created paper snowballs instead of cotton: "I think it's too empty sector because it's not a new layer"
- Stars that don't kick players out of levels for collection-based objectives
- Implementing environmental effects (snow, confetti) with performance constraints

## Business Aspects
- "Of course it will be free download. I can't charge money for this, Nintendo would actually murder me" - Clear acknowledgment of copyright limitations
- "I've decided that if I'm gonna make my own game, we are probably using Godot" - Future plans for original game development
- Godot preferred over Unreal Engine for "iteration is a lot faster" and better "performance for low-end games"
- Past Nintendo DMCA in 2019 for "The Missing Link video"
- No payment deadlines mentioned, suggesting self-funded or volunteer project

## Key Quotes
- "I wanted to solve the issue that there's no reason to explore like all the nooks and crannies in a level" - Core design philosophy
- "If you have two great ideas, why not use both?" - On implementing both "Game & Match" and "Lethal Lava Logs" matchbox brands
- "Watch me, I know how to program. So I can make all my crazy ideas come true. And I have no excuse not to make them." - Personal capability and drive

## Potential Interview Topics

- The collaborative process with remote artists and how creative differences are resolved
- Technical constraints of N64 development and how they inspire creative solutions (e.g., paper vs. cotton snowballs)
- The transition from ROM hacking to considering original game development with Godot
- Balancing personal life, fitness, and intensive game development as an indie developer
