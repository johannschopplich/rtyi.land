## Game Development Process
- Currently developing a cowboy-themed level featuring a saloon/milk bar with detailed interior design
- Multiple courses in various stages of completion: "We have finished the whole level since then. And reworked some old stuff."
- At least 15 main courses planned, with courses 1-7 seemingly complete or in advanced stages
- Planning to rework Course 2 (Divine Dino Domain) to add more platforming elements instead of just water rafting
- Comparing development to Lost Impact in terms of "idea density": "I was looking at RTYI and I think we have a similar idea density."

## Personal Insights
- Strong commitment to N64 hardware limitations: "I'm not interested in ever using more than 8MB just because the original N64 games didn't do it. And going beyond the original limitations is just kinda against the spirit of the challenge."
- Views creation as fundamental to human existence: "What would be the point of an existence where you don't create? That's like the whole purpose of the human soul."
- Draws level design inspiration from dreams: "Usually all the themes in Lost Impact were just things that literally came to me in a dream."
- Critical of conventional design theory, particularly color theory and music theory
- Uses AI tools like ChatGPT for coding assistance but emphasizes not over-relying on them

## Collaborator Information
- Badub/Banduke: Composer creating the game's soundtrack - "Everything Banduke makes a banger, true." Kaze plans to pay him if they create the physical OST cartridge
- Biobak: Graphics artist who developed window rendering techniques - "Dude, Biobank, we need to use your window technique here."
- Zeina: Working on animations, specifically mentioned doing Dry Bones animations - "Are you also doing the drybones animations?"
- Other Contributors: 
  - XPM: Texture artist whose work is being used extensively in the cowboy level
  - Unnamed person who "offered to make the cactuses but they didn't get back to me in three weeks"
  - Sylar: Mentioned as wanting to create a new function for something
  - Community members like Lila who provide active feedback during streams

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Implementing harder Dry Bones enemies that require ground pounds instead of single jumps, with milk-drinking lore justification
- Creating a secret room in the saloon where "bad guys" drink "chalky milk" - an illegal stronger alternative to regular milk
- Managing polygon count for performance: "the cowboy level already has like 14,000 polygons right now"
- Struggling with level theme selection for courses 13-15: "For course 13, 14 and 15, I'm very unsure."
- Considering themes including: space station with "gravity fuckery," oversized casino, music level, dream level, comic book hero level
- Planning to include NPCs with cowboy dialogue to provide gameplay hints

## Business Aspects
- Plans to create physical OST cartridge using new N64 music decompression technology: "I'm probably gonna make a separate cartridge and gonna release this with a box where it's just the rty iost we're gonna sell it for like a hundred dollars"
- Working with Pixel Empire for merchandise including stickers with phrases like "Skill Issue" and "Just Program Well"
- Core game will remain free: "the normal rom you can just get for free and the soundtrack you can also just get for free but it would be really cool to have a physical thing"
- Jokingly offered to add personal easter eggs for $20,000: "Actually, if you pay me $20,000, I will do it. But it will be very small."
- Plans to pay artists who help with the game, specifically mentioning paying Banduke for the OST

## Key Quotes
- "I can't imagine that I will ever just stop creating. That doesn't sound like me at all. What would be the point of an existence where you don't create? That's like the whole purpose of the human soul."
- "Usually all the themes in Lost Impact were just things that literally came to me in a dream. That's probably why they feel so inspired to me."
- "I'm not interested in ever using more than 8MB just because the original N64 games didn't do it. And going beyond the original limitations is just kinda against the spirit of the challenge. At that point, why not just make a game for emulator?"
