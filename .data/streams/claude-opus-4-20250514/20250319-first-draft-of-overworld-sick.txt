## Game Development Process
- Currently working on part 4 of the overworld, specifically a cave/tunnel section that connects part 3 to part 1
- All 12 main courses are complete but undergoing reworks by Biobak: "all 12 main courses are done, but Biobank still will rework a lot of them"
- The overworld will consist of 15 parts total: "this is just four parts out of 15 in the end so it's going to be like four times the size"
- Recent bug fixes include end screen transitions and render bugs
- Considering making the entire overworld seamless without warp transitions, though this presents technical challenges
- Development philosophy: "It's much better to decide on a hub in post than to do it while you're making the game. The hub is the most important part, you need to make it with all the information available to you"

## Personal Insights
- Kaze has been sick for 5 days, affecting his ability to work and eat: "I've been sick for like five days, I don't think I've ever been sick for so long"
- Shows admiration for other ROM hackers: "I'm a huge Rionu fan And I'm copying whatever Rionu does"
- Values logical game design over pure surrealism: "I prefer to keep stuff somewhat sensical"
- Not feeling rushed to release: "I don't feel like I'm hard-pressed to release this as soon as possible"
- Humorous reflection on modern life: "I should have been born in like 1300 and become a fish farmer... And then when I get sick I would just die because I can't feed me or my family"

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: No specific mentions in this transcript
- Biobak: Currently reworking levels, specifically "almost done with course 2 now"
- Zeina: Present during the stream (possibly living with Kaze), inadvertently caused heating issues during the stream
- Other Contributors:
  - Soren: Working on animation compression ideas that "might save a little bit of performance," actively discussing technical solutions with Kaze during the stream

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Major design challenge: Creating seamless transitions between overworld areas without loading screens, complicated by memory constraints and the need to unload/reload areas
- Implementing a "suspense treadmill" concept where players always have something to anticipate, exemplified by the lighthouse being visible from the start but only accessible later
- Fast travel system evolution: Initially considering corked pipes that can only be uncorked from one side, later pivoting to a world map system accessed through the pause menu
- Technical limitation acknowledged: "the game can't really render while a new area is loading in... we don't have enough memory to just keep the old area loaded while loading a new one"
- Design principle for the cave connector: "You start overworld 1 here And you see the whole lighthouse here at the top... You go into the cave And then after you come out of the cave section you're gonna be here up top at the lighthouse"

## Business Aspects
- Considering physical OST release: "I'm actually thinking maybe we can do like a physical cartridge release of the game's OST Which would be the coolest shit ever"
- Legal constraints on physical game release: "I can't release the game physically and I will actually get murdered"
- Plans for a legally distinct version: "hopefully I can make like a legally distinct version of this as well"
- No immediate release pressure: "I don't feel like I'm hard-pressed to release this as soon as possible, though. So I think we're all good"

## Key Quotes
- "The hub is the most important part, you need to make it with all the information available to you"
- "I'm gonna call this the suspense treadmill. You always want the player to have suspense for something that's going to happen"
- "making one area seamless requires knowing how the next area will look like and we don't know what the areas will look like until we're done with them"

## Potential Interview Topics
1. The evolution of the overworld design from initial concept to the current 15-part seamless world, and how technical constraints shaped creative decisions
2. The collaborative process with team members like Biobak and Soren, particularly how their specialized skills (graphics and animation compression) enhance the final product
3. The "suspense treadmill" game design philosophy and how it influences level and overworld design
4. The challenges and opportunities of working within the Mario 64 decompilation framework, including memory management and rendering limitations
5. Future plans for the project, including the potential physical OST release and the "legally distinct version" mentioned
