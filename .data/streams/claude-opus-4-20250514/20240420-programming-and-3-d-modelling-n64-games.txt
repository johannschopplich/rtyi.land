## Game Development Process
- Currently at 80% completion: "It's been at 80% for a while because I keep, like, changing old things"
- Active iteration based on playtesting: "This is just a remake of an old level... I have watched playtesters play it and I realized this area fucking sucks"
- Working on Quest 13 concept: "Quest 13 is going to be an ice castle. On top of a mountain. And it's going to be very gloomy and scary and dark. Or maybe more suspenseful than gloomy and scary and dark"
- Currently developing new areas with lighting effects and flame mechanics
- Removing boring content: "It's called Boring Red Coin Mission that will be removed from the game"

## Personal Insights
- Philosophy on game design: "I think collect-a-thons are really easy to make entertaining. It's just that all the collect-a-thons that exist kind of fucking suck"
- Commitment to open development: "Will the engine be open source? Yes it will be"
- Design inspiration: "I was thinking like Hollow Root Keep in The Missing Link. Yes, I'm going to be using my own game as inspiration"
- Approach to feedback: "I'd rather have people like call me out on any mistakes. I make than have them not do that"
- On invisible walls video: "I made a video about invisible walls today. This shit's doing so well"

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: No relevant information found in this transcript
- Biobak: "I think Biobak also sometimes makes textures for the levels the team works on"
- Zeina: Created multiple signs for course 12 including "tumbleweed store," "koopa bank," and "milk bar" signs. Kaze reviews the signs during stream, noting "this is a pretty good sign i like it definitely looks like a tumbleweed store"
- Other Contributors:
  - Sauron: Making technical decisions about F3DX3 and RQIA - "I'm still waiting for Sauron to make the final decisions on that"
  - Team members collectively contribute textures: "So a bunch of indie- yeah, that's funny actually"

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Major crash bug when swimming: "the crash that we just ran into, is that it's using the S8 register... This function here decides to overwrite the S8 register with some random local variable"
- Redesigning boring areas: Removed an old red coin mission involving fling vines because "It was cute, yeah, but it wasn't very fun"
- Lighting implementation: "How do you do lightning for the torches... I just do this in blender"
- Collision refinement: "the plan here would be to go over here and then jump up there, which doesn't work because of the collision"
- Color scheme for ice castle: "It was gonna be white and desaturated blues. That was gonna be the color theme. So it would be pretty bright, but it would be scary and gloomy"

## Business Aspects
- Engine will be open source: "Will the engine be open source? Yes it will be"
- Content release strategy: "I do wanna release my competition like real bad, but I just can't, cause ASA want me to wait until it's played on stream"
- No specific mentions of marketing, funding, or distribution plans

## Key Quotes
- "I think collect-a-thons are really easy to make entertaining. It's just that all the collect-a-thons that exist kind of fucking suck."
- "I have watched playtesters play it and I realized this area fucking sucks. It's in gay for men to kiss women, no. What was this area before? Let me show you... It's called Boring Red Coin Mission that will be removed from the game."
- "Quest 13 is going to be an ice castle. On top of a mountain. And it's going to be very gloomy and scary and dark. Or maybe more suspenseful than gloomy and scary and dark."
