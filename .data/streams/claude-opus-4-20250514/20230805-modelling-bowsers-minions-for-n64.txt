## Game Development Process
- Using playtest data from "Only Up 64" to improve RTYI physics and camera systems
- Plans to "make like one or two more hacks on the RTYI engine before RTYI is released just to like get everything a little bit improved"
- Currently working on level 11, which features an oil rig setting
- Dealing with memory leaks caused by "too many condition triangles"
- Game runs at 60fps on N64, which "significantly reduces the input lag"
- Testing primarily done on emulator, with N64 testing reserved for performance changes

## Personal Insights
- "The reception of the current rtyi engine is very mixed I find some people say they love it others say they hate it"
- Switched from Twitch to YouTube because "Twitch has gone too many ads. Twitch has gone ad crazy. It's like, unusable"
- Shows perfectionist tendencies: "I changed a lot of the physics and I think they're working a lot better now"
- Expresses frustration with obvious suggestions: "So you think some random fucking youtuber? Just randomly happens to know a thing about optimizing Mario 64 that I don't"
- Philosophy on difficulty: "by being bad at Mario 64, you have better chances of making a good attack. Because if you're good at Mario 64, there's going to be many random things in your game that you won't notice that casual players will have huge problems with"

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: No relevant information found in this transcript
- Biobak: Mentioned briefly as graphics artist but not actively participating in this stream
- Zeina: Actively collaborating on animations during the stream. Created crying/sobbing animations for Koopa character and working on Wiggler animations. Kaze tells Zeina: "so you should give him a sobbing animation for that. Can you do that real quick?"
- Other Contributors: Arthur (community member being considered for moderator role), Valzebrum (viewer/community member mentioned at beginning)

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Implemented unique emotional NPC system: Koopa builder who cries if player ruins too much of his cement work - "if you like basically make almost the entire area black, he's just gonna start crying"
- Created overseer Wiggler character who gets progressively angrier as player disrupts workers: "the wiggler gets more red and so on and so on until eventually you messed with all four people"
- Addressing collision physics criticism: "there's definitely a rose tinting with vanilla Mario 64 collision a lot of people were looking at some of the bugs in RTY or not the bugs some of the oddities in the collision in RTY and it was just like yeah this is a vanilla thing"
- Working on smooth warp transitions: "the inputs are just gonna be held maybe I'm gonna make it so that Mario is holding the stick towards the warp and Mario's normal action are just gonna continue"
- Balancing polygon counts for N64 performance: "He's 671 [polygons] so reasonable just a lot of work"

## Business Aspects
- Recently switched streaming platform: "I stream on YouTube now I switched off twitch"
- Receiving first YouTube monetization: "This is the first day. I'm actually getting like real super chat donations on YouTube"
- Considering Twitter Blue for additional monetization: discussing potential to earn back the $8/month cost through ad revenue
- No specific release date or pricing information mentioned

## Key Quotes
- "we should make like one or two more hacks on the RTYI engine before RTYI is released just to like get everything a little bit improved"
- "I took notes from how we work in years for breakfast and I decided I will make all the magic numbers into defines in this file and I even added comic comments that follow some sort of code guidelines"
- "You have to know your target audience. That's always the key."

## Potential Interview Topics
- The decision to develop multiple games on the RTYI engine before final release and how this iterative approach improved the final product
- Technical challenges and innovations in achieving 60fps on original N64 hardware
- The creative process behind emotional NPC systems and how they enhance player engagement
- How community playtesting data shaped major design decisions
- The transition from solo developer to managing a collaborative team with artists and animators
