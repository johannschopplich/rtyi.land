## Game Development Process
- Current map completion is at 9%, indicating early-to-mid development stage
- Project size is currently 59 megabytes
- Major remaining work includes the final Bowser encounter and five side levels
- Actively developing new sound effect features to allow two sound effects per bank to play simultaneously
- Focus on visual polish with water shaders, foam effects, and environmental details
- Has been working in professional game development for approximately 2-2.5 years
- Implementing comprehensive stats tracking system (jump counts, playtime, deaths, damage taken, coins, save states)

## Personal Insights
- "I mean, I myself as a human don't have much value, right? The values in what I make."
- Expresses strong dislike for 2D platformers and Mario World specifically: "I absolutely hate 2D platformers"
- Avoids using AI tools despite potential benefits due to community backlash concerns: "People will get really mad at me if I do anything AI, or if anything AI touches this game"
- Takes a non-political stance to avoid "culture war" discussions
- Shows perfectionist tendencies and attention to technical details
- Prefers PJ64 1.6 emulator despite known vulnerabilities because "all the other emulators are completely unusable garbage"

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: No specific mentions in this transcript
- Biobak: Graphics artist who is expected to rework/polish visual elements; Kaze mentions "Biobank is probably going to change it anyway, so don't worry if you don't like it right now"
- Zeina: Sends reference pictures to Kaze during development; shown to be actively involved in the project
- Other Contributors:
  - Lila: Technical collaborator who assists with coding and implementation questions
  - Fazerna: Has access to the project and could release it if needed
  - Falco: Helped fix compatibility bugs with Parallel emulator
  - Approximately 10 people total have access to Return to Yoshi's Island

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Implementing dual sound effect playback per bank to "seriously improve the sound effect quality across the board"
- Creating realistic water foam effects that respond to wave height and shore proximity
- Dealing with texture UV mapping challenges and material labeling limitations
- Designing waves to be flat near shore while maintaining visual appeal
- Resolving compatibility issues with various N64 emulators, particularly Parallel
- Discovered and explained the "booloth" sound bug in original Mario 64 (low-pitched boo sound caused by wind effect interruption)

## Business Aspects
- Would pursue full-time development with sufficient Patreon support: "If you have enough patrons around us, would you do this full time? Um Yes, actually, yes, for sure, yes"
- Maintains a private repository with all assets for project security
- No specific release date mentioned, but indicates significant work remains
- Conscious of community perception affecting project reception, particularly regarding AI usage

## Key Quotes
- "I'm making it so two sound effects can play at the same time, isn't that fucking cool?"
- "There's like 10 people that have access to Return to Yoshi's Island. I also have a private repo with all the assets, so nothing would be lost if I died."
- "What if the map is done? 9%... We're still missing the final Bowser. We're missing like five side levels."

## Potential Interview Topics
1. The collaborative nature of the project - how does managing 10+ contributors work in a ROM hack development environment?
2. Technical innovation in N64 development - exploring the dual sound effect system and other engine improvements
3. The balance between perfectionism and progress - how does Kaze decide when something is "good enough"?
4. The relationship between creator identity and creative output - expanding on his philosophy that his value lies in what he creates
5. Community expectations vs. creative vision - navigating controversial topics like AI usage while maintaining artistic integrity
