## Game Development Process
- Currently implementing boss mechanics for an oil-themed level featuring a boss called Gargantua Block/Blark
- Working on FPS optimization issues with code provided by collaborator Silas
- Implementing camera systems that dynamically adjust during boss fights
- Game includes multiple worlds with varying difficulty levels ("The first level is baby easy. The second level is baby easy. It doesn't really get difficult until later on.")
- Still making decisions about which content will make it to final version ("We don't even know that the dojo will still be in there in the end")
- Working with audio file size constraints ("That song is huge It's gonna take up like 5 megabytes of ROM space And... We don't really have that space")

## Personal Insights
- "I actually had a pretty big revelation today. And that is, that there's a problem with playing ROM-Mix. And that is that the player's expectation is that they can easily 100% the game... We can't put hard challenges without people complaining. We can't put super secret hidden stuff without people complaining. And I think that really takes away a lot of design space."
- "See, my philosophy is, what people feel, in a way, is real. You can't change that fact. But their reasoning is most of the time stupid. You should just ignore people's reasoning. But you can never really ignore people's feeling."
- "I never want the player to be in a level and then feel like, oh, I should leave this level and come back with a different set of equipment. I feel like that's a really bad thought to have in your mind."
- Strong criticism of modern Pokemon games: "Dude, how are you the Pokemon company and you make fucking Scarlet and Violet? I'm so upset. It's actually so tragic what's happening to Pokemon."

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: No direct mentions in this transcript
- Biobak: Actively participates in chat, suggesting design elements like metal teeth for the boss ("By metal teeth. I think it looks very cool That's a very good idea by biomech") and proposing difficulty badge systems
- Zeina (Lila): Present during stream, involved in discussions about animations and vertex displacement, playfully interacts with Kaze during the stream
- Other Contributors:
  - Silas: Provided optimized code for improving FPS ("This is actually Silas' code He gave me a new version of this that is supposedly a lot faster")
  - Clayman: Active in chat providing feedback on game mechanics
  - Various community members participating in design discussions

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Implementing boss fight with oil-themed mechanics where Mario takes damage over time in oil
- Camera system that dynamically adjusts based on boss proximity to maintain visibility
- Struggling with player expectations for 100% completion in ROM hacks versus design freedom
- Considering implementation of difficulty modifiers/perks system: "You get a badge that makes Mario move 1% faster... or you can pick a perk that makes it so instead of void out, you just lose 1 health"
- Removed 100 coin stars to avoid players feeling they need to leave and return to levels
- Strong emphasis on overworld design: "The overworld needs to be full of secrets. That is so important. That's gonna make or break the game. Guaranteed."
- Balancing boss difficulty: "Okay, it's pretty difficult. I think it's too difficult. I don't think it should be this difficult. I mean, I did it, but normal people are not going to be able to."

## Business Aspects
- Potential podcast appearance with James Lambert: "And they asked if I wanted to host it or, like, be on the podcast. And in the end, the suggestion we had was that me and James Lambert on the podcast would, like, interview each other."
- Community engagement through polling about player expectations
- Plans to return to twice-weekly streaming schedule after completing another project

## Key Quotes
- "The overworld needs to be full of secrets. That is so important. That's gonna make or break the game. Guaranteed."

## Potential Interview Topics
1. The tension between player expectations and creative freedom in ROM hack development - how does this influence design decisions?
2. The collaborative process with contributors like Silas, Biobak, and Zeina - how do their contributions shape the final product?
3. The technical challenges of optimizing performance within the constraints of N64 hardware and ROM size limitations
4. The philosophy behind difficulty and accessibility in game design - exploring the proposed badge/perk system
5. The importance of overworld design and secrets in creating a compelling player experience
