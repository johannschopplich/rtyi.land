## Game Development Process
- Currently working on an oil-themed area with oil drills and special oil enemies, nearing completion: "we're gonna be working on this today we're probably gonna finish this um there's one enemy we need to we can move on to the uh the 8-bit section"
- Course 4 (zoo level) has been repaired and is ready for beta testing: "most of what i did off cam was actually fixing up course four i finished fixing up course four so it's ready for beta testing we're gonna send it off to be tested soon"
- Ongoing challenge of maintaining older levels while developing new content: "somehow whenever we work we're breaking a bunch of old levels so i'm going through them all again and fixing them in general like bug fixes that i found during testing"
- The game now supports up to model ID 0x60 due to hashing tables implementation: "we have so much more space for geos. We can actually have up to model ID 0x60, which is insane"

## Personal Insights
- Strong commitment to open-sourcing the project: "I will definitely open sources like no worry This is guaranteed open source I want people to be able to maintain this code base after I leave the scene And I want other people to be able to make hex off of my engine"
- Balancing passion with financial reality: "I Wish I could [make a new N64 game] But it's not financially viable decision for me to make And I do have a family now that I need to provide for So I can't just fuck around with my time and do that"
- Views on ROM hacking legitimacy: "I think Romhacks creates more loyalty and fandom around Nintendo. I cannot think of any reason to ban Romhack in 2013 games"
- Extreme attention to optimization: "Yes, 4 microseconds is a lot in my world" (regarding code optimization)

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: No relevant information found in this transcript
- Biobak: Referenced as someone who might criticize polygon usage ("before Biobank cusses me out"), suggesting they have high standards for graphics optimization
- Zeina: Currently creating animations for the game, specifically mentioned working on animations for Course 4. Also mentioned in personal context (Kaze took a call from "Zaina's dad" about house matters)
- Other Contributors: 
  - Lila/Leela: A chat moderator who hasn't been present recently (subject of running jokes)
  - Beta testers: Course 4 is being sent to unnamed beta testers
  - fast64 developers: Mentioned as an open-source tool that needs more contributors

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Created "Fizz Oil" enemy with unique slippery mechanic: "Basically, what this is going to do, this is going to slime around, and then when it sees Mario, it's going to go whoop. Whoop. And turn into a puddle like this. Then you can slide on it"
- Philosophy on enemy difficulty: "not every enemy has to be like a super obstacle, right? It's fine if he's more optical than or vibe-giving than dangerous. He's still gonna affect gameplay"
- Significant improvements to existing assets: "the chain chomp look the chain chomp is so much nicer looking now and the ball too the ball looked so shit before we have new eyes on the chain chomp"
- Working around engine limitations: "Since we don't want to touch engine code, we need to somehow externally do this" (regarding the slippery surface mechanic)
- Star select concept showing Mario traveling to levels: "the idea with the star selects is that it shows mario traveling to the level"

## Business Aspects
- Strong commitment to open source release for community sustainability
- Acknowledges financial constraints of N64 development: "it's not financially viable decision for me to make"
- Content strategy for maintaining interest: "I kind of want to upload some rty content just so people know that the game is not bad"
- Uses patches for legal protection: "I get around legal stuff by just releasing a patch"

## Key Quotes

## Potential Interview Topics
- The challenge of maintaining and updating older content while developing new levels, and strategies for managing this iterative process
- The decision to open source the project and vision for community involvement after release
- How family responsibilities have influenced development decisions and time management
- The collaborative process with Zeina, Biobak, and other contributors - how work is divided and coordinated
- Design philosophy around balancing technical limitations with creative vision, especially regarding enemy behavior and player experience
