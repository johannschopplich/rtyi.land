## Game Development Process
- Currently working on multiple aspects including "Only Up 64" (described as "the biggest level ever made on Mario 64"), tox boxes with new animations, and a seesaw mechanism with Goomba enemies
- Implemented new collision code that makes ceiling interactions "a lot more stable now"
- Regular testing on actual N64 hardware, though noting "There's basically a 50% chance the game won't boot"
- Design document is "getting long" indicating substantial planning and scope
- Performance optimization is ongoing, with the game running at 20-30 FPS in demanding areas
- No optimization has been done yet: "we didn't optimize anything at all yet, like literally nothing"

## Personal Insights
- "My streams here and they are like all about the game if you get entertained that's a side effect I just care about making a good game"
- Regarding streaming platform choice: "I stream on case clips because we have 10 000 subs here... I don't want to ruin my algorithm"
- On coding philosophy: "Safety checks are for weenies. Imagine if I had safety checked that, and never realized that there was a bug to begin with"
- Frustration with tools: "I hate parallel launcher. I hate it"
- Time constraints: "Man i'm so busy actually I will never have my freedom"

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: Composer who was expected to create music but "Badoop's been missing in attendance for a bit so I'm not really sure what to expect there"
- Biobak: Not mentioned in this transcript
- Zeina: Animator who "made the animations for this guy already or most of them" (referring to tox box animations). Also noted as being "out with friends today"
- Other Contributors: SimpleFlips mentioned as competition host; various community members in chat providing feedback

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Tox boxes design challenge: "I still have to think of a way to make it so that Mario can't like move through the walls like this it's a bit difficult"
- Level design philosophy: "I think it's nicer if the worlds are like separate and the interconnectedness comes from the overworld alone. Having it the way Banjo-Tooie did it means you add a lot of backtracking and I don't like that"
- Performance optimization through backface culling: had to balance visual quality vs. performance, deciding to enable it only on N64 for better frame rates
- Division by zero bug discovered during N64 testing, revealing compiler optimization issues
- Creating a Womp enemy designed as a construction worker with a helmet on their back

## Business Aspects
- "my youtube channel Is barely profitable, especially now that brilliant doesn't sponsor me anymore kind of back to square zero"
- "I could pay you a little bit from the youtube money" (in response to collaborator payment question)
- Unable to disclose day job salary: "I don't know if my workplace would want me to share my salary"
- Previous sponsorship deal: "we had a deal for six videos and i've made my six videos And that's it now"
- Mentioned earning from "Hat in Time" work but current financial situation is more constrained

## Key Quotes
- "We only need to fake it well enough that no one notices that it's fake" (on game development approach)
- "This is why I hate having two repos, because now I need to fix this in two places at once" (on technical challenges)
- "I think if you are in school anything on a calculator is fucking amazing because you can just play it in school" (discussing F3 competition entries)

## Potential Interview Topics
- The technical challenges of developing for N64 hardware limitations and how they influence design decisions
- Managing a distributed team of collaborators and dealing with availability issues
- The decision to prioritize game quality over streaming entertainment value
- Financial sustainability of ROM hack development post-sponsorship
- The balance between innovation (new collision systems, massive levels) and hardware constraints
