## Game Development Process
- Currently implementing the final Yoshi coin in a level, with collision work to follow
- The game now contains 410 text boxes (almost three times vanilla Mario 64's count)
- Three levels remain incomplete, but the project is estimated to have three times as much content as the original Mario 64
- Current level is nearly complete, pending animations from collaborators and sound implementation
- Development includes live streaming sessions where progress is shown and community feedback is incorporated

## Personal Insights
- Kaze expresses strong frustration with Stack Overflow's demanding culture: "Do you want me to write you a code that starts two threads on the N64 and adds the register thing? That's a little bit unreasonable. If you don't know how to get rid of the warning, shut up."
- Shows preference for exploration-based gameplay: "I think the way 100 coin stars are done in Mario Sunshine is great... you get them by interacting with the environment in like creative ways and that's how I want the Yoshi coins to work as well"
- Reveals significant financial struggles: "Guys if you ever wanna make a Patreon, do not use Patreon, use Ko-fi or something. They take a smaller cut and they're not as dogshit to work with."
- Demonstrates practical approach to development: "Usually when someone makes a hack, at the very beginning they decide whether they wanna target real hardware or not. And then most of the time people say no."

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Implemented a bandit character that steals coins from the player when they look away, with an easter egg where it gives a Yoshi coin out of pity if the player has zero coins
- Replaced traditional 100 coin stars with Yoshi coins that reward creative environmental interaction and exploration
- Optimized pokey enemy raycasts from 31 down to 1 for performance: "it's fucking insane... there's one raycast per piece for some reason"
- Developed a train system with path-following mechanics and collision detection
- Uses "cowboy translation" for Western-themed dialogue, utilizing ChatGPT for dialect conversion

## Business Aspects
- Actively seeking YouTube sponsorships for content monetization
- Patreon payment system finally functional after 1.5 years of issues: "after one and a half years of being unable to get payments from Patreon, they finally made it so that my account works again"
- PayPal remains non-functional with funds "frozen in time"
- Considering financial viability of future projects: "most likely it will be my own game made in Unreal Engine just cuz I have to think about the financial aspects as well"
- Anticipates bootleg copies: "this game are gonna go out in five years there's gonna be so many bootleg pads of this"

## Key Quotes
- "we probably have three times as much content as vanilla mario 64 as well which is kind of insane"

- "Guys can you believe that after one and a half years of being unable to get payments from Patreon, they finally made it so that my account works again?"
