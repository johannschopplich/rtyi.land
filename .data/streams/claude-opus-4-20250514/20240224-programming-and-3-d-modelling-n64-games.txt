## Game Development Process
- Currently working on course 12 of 15 levels, focusing on a Mario Kart 64-themed retro stage
- In the process of switching to F3DEX3 microcode but encountering performance issues that need to be resolved before final implementation
- Each level features a "retro pipe" referencing games from before the N64's lifecycle ended
- Development involves real-time testing on actual N64 hardware using an Everdrive X5 flashcart
- Collaborative optimization process with microcode developer to achieve expected 5-15% performance improvement

## Personal Insights
- "I just want to make my N64 game. Ideally, I wouldn't have to deal with emulators at all."
- Strong preference for ensuring emulator compatibility: "I want to make sure [it] runs fine on emulators"
- Design philosophy focuses on Mario's movement: "We want the fun to be for Mario's movement and not just random things like that. It kind of feels like, oh, you like Mario 64. Well, fuck you. Here's Mario Kart. I don't want that."
- Still uses Project64 1.6 for convenience despite its security issues: "It's just so convenient to use"
- Believes in the N64's nostalgic aesthetic but has faced criticism for expressing this view

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: No relevant information found in this transcript
- Biobak: No relevant information found in this transcript
- Zeina: Mentioned as someone who offered to do animations in 2021 but failed to deliver after repeatedly promising to complete them
- Other Contributors:
  - Soren: Developer of F3DEX3 microcode, created Sec64 (music sequence format tool), directed Triforce% (Ocarina of Time arbitrary code execution at GDQ), does N64 music arranging, former synthesizer builder
  - Arthur: Contributed the idea for including a Mario 64 retro pipe as a meta-joke

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Chose to use vertex coloring for entire levels instead of real-time lighting for performance reasons
- Uses directional lighting only for moving actors, with up to 7 light sources in some levels
- Implementing "fake" point lights through vertex colors computed on CPU rather than using actual point lights
- Designing timed race challenges (40-45 seconds) with hidden shortcuts through tunnels
- Each retro stage must maintain consistent theming (colors, aesthetics) with its source game
- Planned features include moving trains, smoke particles, cacti obstacles, and a Yoshi shootout in a cowboy-themed level
- Performance optimization is a constant concern: "The problem is, f3d-ex3 on my game runs significantly slower. So we need to fix that."

## Business Aspects
- Awareness of ROM hack repro carts being sold without permission: Kaze saw his work being sold for $50 at MagFest
- Mentions online stores making "millions" from selling ROM hack compilations with "a hundred thousand sales"
- No specific business plans or monetization strategies mentioned for Return to Yoshi's Island

## Key Quotes
- "We're expecting this to be a huge improvement" - regarding F3DEX3 microcode optimization
- "I have like a retro pipe on every level. That's like referencing a retro game that came out before the N64 life cycle ended."
- "Someone offered to do the animations in 2021 and they kept saying I'll do it, I'll do it, I'll do it and then they didn't do it. And that's why you don't do call-ups."

## Potential Interview Topics
1. The creative process behind the "retro pipe" concept and how each reference is chosen to fit within the game's overall design
2. The challenges of optimizing for both real hardware and emulator compatibility, and how this shapes development decisions
3. The collaborative process with technical specialists like Soren and how external expertise enhances the project
4. Lessons learned about managing remote collaborators and ensuring deliverables after the animation incident
5. Views on the ROM hacking community's relationship with commercial exploitation and thoughts on protecting creative work
