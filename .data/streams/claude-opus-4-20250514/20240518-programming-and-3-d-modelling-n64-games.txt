## Game Development Process
- Currently working on Course 13 (ice castle level): "3 out of 5 areas done. The factories and say no, only the office and boss area to go. Okay. And those are the smallest areas. So, that sounds pretty promising."
- Main development goal for the stream: "today our goal is to kind of greybox the level, I guess. Outline the level. I don't know if greybox is the correct word here. Basically, make the platforming good."
- Accidentally fixed a major bug while working on other features: "i think i just fixed that whole thing on accident all right awesome see and this is why i don't go bug fixing until like the very end sometimes bugs just randomly get fixed like that"
- Plans for content reveal: "When I burned down the forest for the general reveal, I burned down the Nintendo of Japan headquarters for the general reveal."

## Personal Insights
- Strong opinion on Mario 64 DS: "I think it has no right to exist and it's a terrible game and it shouldn't have been made. I hate video games."
- Development philosophy regarding bugs: "I feel like it's more time efficient to just not worry about them, cause you might just randomly stumble upon the fix. Which is what happened to me, like a lot of the time."
- Personal life update: "We're going to have a kid in like two months. That's the birth date. I thought everyone knew. It's a girl, by the way, so it's not a mini case."
- Confidence in completing the project despite personal changes: "Well, have you ever heard me not just follow through with the plan? Yeah, I mean. Who do you take me for?"

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: No specific mentions in this transcript
- Biobak: Actively contributing ice effect ideas and technical solutions - "Biobank's appearing path thing, yes. I definitely want that in here." Sent Blender files with ice effect concepts: "iceeffect.blend" 
- Zeina: Described as having documentary plans for the game release - "Eiza had like a special plan for the video. So, let's see how that goes. Eiza wanted it to make like a little bit of a documentary thing almost." Also mentioned as Kaze's wife and co-parent.
- Other Contributors: Robert (mentioned for video approval), various chat participants providing suggestions and feedback during the stream

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Ice platform mechanics: "Ice platform that cracks on the first jump and breaks on the second"
- Environmental effects: "Wind gusts in the castle somehow, so maybe we need like windows"
- Visual design inspired by Mario Galaxy: "ice path that appears as you get closer. Like the Mario Galaxy lightbulb thing"
- Technical challenge with platform disappearing animation: "I'm trying to create a nice ice platform that cracks as you jump on it and it needs like a proper disappear animation too so i think it has potential but it's not good yet"
- Removed unintended movement mechanics: "You know the thing where you can do this and then a triple jump? You can't do that anymore. Because a bug fix required changes to this."

## Business Aspects
- Mario Builder release announcement: "OK, what is releasing Mario Builder tomorrow? I can give you a quick preview. Right. And so I'm going to make like a video that's just like a bunch of cool Mario 64 clips."
- Marketing video strategy: "Basically, I'm making a satisfying Mario 64 clips video. And this is supposed to be the thumbnail here."
- Documentary production plans with Zeina for game release
- Commission work availability: "Would you 3D model my tombstone blender so I could print it and make it my eternal resting place? You could commission me for that."
- Full OST release plans: "I am planning to upload the full OST at some point. And have a playlist for it."

## Key Quotes
- "Sometimes bugs just randomly get fixed like that" - illustrating Kaze's pragmatic approach to development
- "Eiza wanted it to make like a little bit of a documentary thing almost. So, I'm waiting for that to be settled first." - showing collaborative approach to game release
- "I've modeled the whole castle so far without planning that in. It could be in the snowman hideout." - demonstrating iterative design process
