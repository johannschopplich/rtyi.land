## Game Development Process
- Course 13 is "mostly done now" with Xena finishing remaining work on the outside area
- Currently developing Course 14 (craft materials level) - creating assets before arranging them into level shape
- Course 15 already has platforms completed but needs to be imported and assembled
- Overall timeline: "I'm still going to work on it in six or seven months when this is done"
- ROM size limit set at 64 MB
- Release strategy planned in versions: "Version 1 runs on emulator and N64. And then 1.1 also runs on N64 emulator. And then 1.2 is only N64"
- Constant optimization work: "There's new optimizations constantly. Just recently we imported F3DX3"

## Personal Insights
- On his past work: "when i made last impact really my thought was never can i make this fun it was always just i have an idea i'll put it in... without even double checking anything just because i didn't want to be lazy"
- Design philosophy shift: "I didn't want the game to be fun. I wanted everything to be interesting"
- Game development advice: "My advice to get people getting into game development is always make as many games as possible as fast as possible. So you learn because your first 100 games or so are just going to suck ass"
- On advertising and sponsorships: "I think ads are like not a good thing for anyone. So typically I do not take any sponsorships unless it's like, you know, something I actually think has some merit to it"
- Personal motivation: "I just wanted to make sure I'm physically fit so I can be mentally fit"
- Reflection on community: "This is also like the most civil place that I've ever seen politics being discussed"

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: No specific mentions in this transcript
- Biobak: Referenced as working on graphics ("It's probably gonna get a lot better once Biobank gets a sense on this"), given time off ("I told Biomech he can take the day off if he wants to never see his family again and die")
- Zeina: Working on Course 13 outside area, tested physics systems ("I had Zeyna test it, and she managed to move pretty well with these physics"), creating overworld sketches ("Zena was already doing like sketches though she wanted to make the overworld")
- Other Contributors: 
  - Soren - Working on RSP (Reality Signal Processor) programming and optimization
  - Unnamed video editor - Edited Kaze's YouTube videos

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Course 14 concept: Craft materials level featuring crayons, cardboard, plastic cups, pins, and paper elements
- Star missions planned for Course 14: Helping Yoshi with squirrels eating apples, finding Toad on mountain, helping Luigi draw a star with yellow crayon, platforming inside cardboard box, weasel ball toy guarding red coins, 8-bit pipe to Mario Paint
- Technical challenges: Frame rate optimization (targeting 30+ FPS on N64), cloud rendering issues, input lag concerns
- Design elements: Tilting cardboard platform with toothpicks as pivot points, string hanging mechanics on pins, paper airplane riding concept
- Aesthetic decisions: "Craytendo" or "Koopa's Tail" as potential crayon brand names, emphasis on craft material authenticity

## Business Aspects
- Potential Raid Shadow Legends sponsorship discussed (using ChatGPT to negotiate)
- YouTube strategy: "being more of a YouTuber is probably my best way to make more money. And it's also good PR for when I'm actually make my game"
- Recent video success: "The problem with the grass in Mario 64" performing well on YouTube algorithm
- Content creation plans: "I'm gonna try to produce a lot more YouTube content soon"
- Future game development: Plans to create own game on Steam with N64 version as advertisement
- Financial perspective: "I would not make my own N64 game from scratch because I have no reason to. It would be more financially successful if I just made the game on Steam"

## Key Quotes
- "My advice to get people getting into game development is always make as many games as possible as fast as possible. So you learn because your first 100 games or so are just going to suck ass."
- "When i made last impact really my thought was never can i make this fun it was always just i have an idea i'll put it in like i didn't even double think double check if it was a good idea"
- "I'm going to make a bunch of videos after this is done and work on my own game."
