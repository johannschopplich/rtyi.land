## Game Development Process
- Currently working on "Force 14" (Return to Yoshi's Island), implementing new mechanics and redesigning existing areas
- Recently added a crayon drawing mechanic where players can draw with a marker and color stars to collect them: "Look, I added a cool pastel crayon... You can draw with a marker... And if you color the star, you get a star"
- Iterative development approach - testing physics and mechanics live, making adjustments based on feel
- Working on paper spring platforming mechanics with custom physics implementation
- Made gameplay adjustments like making certain enemies drop five coins
- Planning major redesign of the snow biome section: "So the Styrofoam mountains, I have decided they're terrible. And I want to redo them"

## Personal Insights
- On ROM hacking: "Rummiking is like 5% fun and 90% suffering. So the answer is sometimes"
- Level design philosophy: "I realized you kind of need to just do random shit. You kind of just need to be schizophrenic and make connections that don't actually exist in your levels to maximize on that concept"
- On difficulty and accessibility: "I'm very conscious of the difficulty of the mod. I make sure that people can play my games. Someone once told me that games being difficult is like an accessibility issue. And I can kind of see that"
- About freedom in game design: "I always say freedom is the ability to do things without a penalty basically... I think the fact that you can just do crazy movement like that and it's like not required is also part of the freedom feeling we want"
- On dealing with Nintendo: "Nintendo is not one meathead that's like getting upset if you look at them the wrong way. They are a big company making calculated decisions"

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Implementing crayon mechanics with Luigi's story: "Luigi's like, I lost my crayon, now I can't color my star. So you pick up the crayon"
- Technical challenge with paper spring geometry: Spent significant time trying to figure out the complex folding pattern and physics
- Design philosophy against arbitrary changes: "We don't want to make arbitrary changes like that to something that's global across the game. When we make a change like that, we want it to be like the same thing, but improved"
- Redesigning snow biome to create a journey: "I want bringing the crayon back to be a challenge. I want there to be something in the way of like stopping you. I want this to be a little bit of a journey"
- Considering innovative mechanics like using the crayon to draw platforms: "What if you use the crayon to draw something on the floor to make progress?"

## Business Aspects
- Satirical marketing ideas: "When I start making my own game, what if I start marketing myself like either a rapper or one of those comedians that keep talking about how they're going to get canceled?"
- Joke about leveraging controversy: "I could like go to prison for like two years for copyright infringement and then like come out and be like my game is so good. They put me in prison for it"
- Tweeted at Nintendo (as a joke) asking for Mario 64 rights on his birthday

## Key Quotes
- "Which Mario 64 level do you think had the most potential that was wasted?... The most places definitely Big Boos Haunt or Hazy Maze Cave"
- "Dark Souls is designed in a way that you kind of just build a neural net to dodge the boss patterns and that's gonna result in everyone being able to beat the bosses in finite time. Which you know clearly is fun for people, but I don't know if I would call it difficult"
- "The beauty of Mario 64 [is] that you can self-impose challenges like that and it's fun because like the movement is fun"

## Potential Interview Topics
- The evolution of the crayon mechanic and how it ties into Luigi's narrative role in the game
- The philosophy of "controlled chaos" in level design - making connections that don't exist to create memorable experiences
- Balancing accessibility with challenge - how the team ensures the game remains playable for beginners while offering depth for experienced players
- The iterative development process and role of community feedback during live streams
- The creative process behind translating real-world craft materials (paper, crayons, springs) into game mechanics
