## Game Development Process
- Currently working on Course 11 (Bowser's tower/oil rig level) with multiple star objectives planned
- Spent the week "making improvements to the game... going back, fixing all the random stuff" and working through to-do list from Course 1 onward
- Completely remade the 3D section in N-Curse 2 and reworked multiple levels from the demo version including "Deep Dives Through the Dorms," "Turtle Street," "Deep Sea Dive," and "Bomb Cat's Secret"
- Project timeline: "this one's gonna take thousands of hours it's gonna take years"
- Development includes iterative refinement - "basically everything in this level has been completely reworked from the demo"

## Personal Insights
- Strong stance on game quality: "this is a game, not a meme... I'm stuck up for making sure that my game is not just a meme, but this is what I want in my life"
- Critical of modern game development: "the fact that no one even thinks to use matrix animations i swear they are just so much better"
- Work ethic: "I don't mind working 70-hour weeks. I'm kind of just a little different"
- Design philosophy on naming: "it has to be like an alliteration or like a rhyme or something"
- On Mario Sunshine: "mario's sunshine is one of the worst video games to ever exist" but still considers implementing some of its features
- Values immediate action in learning: "Literally, just open a compiler and start it. Have a project you want to do and do it"

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: No relevant information found in this transcript
- Biobak: Created new health meter sprites with careful attention to color brightness progression. Kaze notes "Me and Biobank, we went through a lot of back and forth to get these colors exactly right"
- Zeina: Appears to be Kaze's wife/partner. Mentioned helping rescue a bird, planning to play board games together, and making comments about meal prep during potential streaming marathons
- Other Contributors: 
  - UED: Past collaborator who "really really loves banjo" and influenced putting Banjo elements in previous hacks
  - Mentioned but not direct contributors: Robot (CurseMirror creator), Frobo (Missing Stars creator), Skalox (Star Road creator)

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Implemented new camera controls: "C left and right to rotate the camera... D-pad up and D-pad down doing this. And we got R to center the camera behind Mario"
- Shortened breath meter "because in this level you'd be able to just get everywhere. And I don't want that to happen"
- Added smooth scaling animations to power meter: "scale in when it appears and refilling it should be smooth instead of just instantly adding a chunk"
- Color cohesion critical: "I care a lot about making the colors work together in a way that is satisfying"
- Performance optimization challenges: "we didn't do any optimization yet this might just be the worst possible draw order"
- Level naming process settled on "Oily Boily Bay" after considering multiple alliterative options

## Business Aspects
- Has a full-time job as "a programmer at a video game company" because "ROM making is not that lucrative"
- Limited streaming schedule due to work: "I am also very busy with my actual real job that pays my bills now"
- Considering two-week streaming marathon during vacation: "I get a two week break from work at the end of next month"
- No specific marketing or distribution plans mentioned in this transcript

## Key Quotes
- "Learning C before you've learned assembly is like explaining color to a blind person. Right? You need to get vision first before you can learn what color is."
- "I want a game that keeps me occupied for the long term."
- "What kind of n64 game looks like this? Not even Donkey Kong 64 looks like that"

## Potential Interview Topics
- The balance between maintaining a full-time game development job while creating an ambitious ROM hack over multiple years
- The collaborative process with Biobak on achieving precise visual aesthetics and the importance of color theory in retro game design
- Technical innovations achieved within N64 hardware constraints and how they compare to modern game development
- The philosophy behind creating a "game, not a meme" and maintaining artistic integrity in the ROM hacking community
- The iterative development process from demo to final version and how player feedback influenced major redesigns
