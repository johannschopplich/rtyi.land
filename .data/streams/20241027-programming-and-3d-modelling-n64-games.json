The bug exposes emulator-specific instability (especially Project64/Parallel) versus real N64 behavior, leading to memory-corruption suspicions and vertex-buffer allocation auditing. Midstream he pivots into level-design adjustments (a “zipper to hell” platforming section) and broader art/performance decisions: potentially abandoning the costly normal-mapped “styrofoam” look in favor of simpler cardboard/paper staples, plus addressing severe overdraw and RDP bottlenecks that make this the worst-performing level so far.",
