Mid-stream he discusses community backlash to a Teemu sponsorship, his stance on generative AI, and (most notably) a plan to publish an engine-only repository before RTYI’s public release to solicit bug fixes and help scrub any remaining Nintendo code—plus a tentative, lawyer-dependent idea of a fully custom-IP PC/Steam port.",
