He discusses a major Course 6 asset re-import that mysteriously fixed several bugs, experiments with fruit texturing (especially an orange with reflections), and makes broader design calls: fast travel via a pause-menu map, avoiding “item babysitting” objectives, and skipping a day/night system because it wasn’t planned from the start. The stream also includes candid personal tangents (smell sensitivity, a “strawberry shortcake” wedding story) and a longer discussion about neurodivergence and insulting language.",
