The work is a mix of design tuning (where the boss stands, when doors open) and low-level behavior/state debugging (goombas pushing, boulder state, inverted directions).",
      "challenge": "The boss fight had unwanted behaviors and unclear gameplay beats: spike-goombas visually popped/teleported, boulder helpers didn’t behave reliably, and the fight didn’t consistently enforce the intended ‘aim the boulder’ skill.",
      "process": "Kaze debugs animation/angle math causing the spike-goomba pop, corrects a random-range assumption (0..1 vs -1..1) affecting movement/position logic, adjusts action-state transitions so the boulder actually ‘fires’/moves at the right time, and reworks goomba pushing so each goomba contributes a small movement delta (stronger when both are present).",
      "outcome": "The fight logic largely matches the intended design by the end: goombas can push the boulder and the boulder can be aimed into the King, but Kaze flags remaining polish items—missing animations (kick/angry), boss doors tied to the anger state, and making the boss’s disappearance/despawn look more natural.",
