## Game Development Process
- Project has been in development for almost three years and is approximately 70% complete, with engine upgrades mostly finished
- Currently in polish phase, working on tutorial systems and design refinements rather than core engine work
- Plans to release as open source once completed
- Focus has shifted from technical implementation to user experience and accessibility improvements
- Iterative development approach with frequent design changes and community feedback integration

## Personal Insights
- "that's the thing when you make games it always starts like really fun and eventually it turns into pure torture that's just the cycle of making games" - reveals the emotional journey of long-term game development
- "there's a lot of people starting their mod and they're just quitting if you look at the rate of what's getting finished for major projects like this it's below four percent" - shows awareness of industry completion rates and project management challenges
- Emphasizes the importance of starting with small projects before attempting major ones, based on his experience watching others fail
- Strong focus on accessibility and clear communication in game design due to ROM hack limitations

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: No specific information found in this transcript
- Biobak: Graphics artist who "did a lot of revamping to make this look prettier" and actively works on textures, visual improvements, and provides real-time feedback during development streams
- Zeina: Works on animations, sends video updates of animation work for review, appears to handle character movement and cutscene work
- Other Contributors: Active community of chat members who provide design feedback, suggestions, and participate in real-time development decisions

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Tutorial system design challenge: "because with the romhack you have the disadvantage that no one paid for your game. So there's no initial commitment from the player" - leading to focus on patience budget and concise design
- Movement mechanics implementation including dive jump, wall kick, and spin jump with careful consideration of player learning curve
- Camera system philosophy: avoiding unpredictable camera movements that could cause player disorientation due to human reaction time limitations
- Balancing accessibility with complexity, especially in tutorial design for first-time players
- Technical optimization challenges including performance on N64 hardware and memory management

## Business Aspects
- Plans to release as open source after completion
- Awareness of legal complexities: "this is kind of technically illegal for me to do" but notes "They haven't sent a C&D over this game to me, they really liked it"
- No traditional monetization model discussed, appears to be passion project
- Platform consideration: experimenting with YouTube streaming over Twitch due to ad-related user experience issues

## Key Quotes
- "i've been programming this for almost three years now but we are getting close to finish well i mean like 70 percent maybe although like all the engine upgrades are done now mostly we're still upgrading it"
- "that's why i always tell people to start with a small project otherwise they are just going to not get anything done at all"
- "because with the romhack you have the disadvantage that no one paid for your game. So there's no initial commitment from the player"
