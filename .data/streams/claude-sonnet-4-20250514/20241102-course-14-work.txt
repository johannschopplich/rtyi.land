## Game Development Process
- Currently working on course 14 (pyramid level), focusing on texturing after completing layout design
- Project is in late-stage development with plans to finish main content in 2025, followed by beta testing and bug fixing
- Using Blender as level editor with Fast64 script for N64 format exports
- Recent analytics show significant attention (206,000 views mentioned), indicating growing public interest
- Major design iteration happening in real-time, shifting from complex maze design to simpler central room concept

## Personal Insights
- Kaze demonstrates thoughtful, iterative approach to design: "I Did run through this before to test the gameplay and I'm not sure if I like it or hate it"
- Shows concern for player experience: "This is a really dangerous design, too... maybe I'm asking too much of the player"
- Expresses willingness to scrap significant work for better design: "Sucks I did all this but most of this is reusable. So it's fine"
- Maintains casual, humorous streaming personality while working on serious technical challenges
- Values player accessibility and expects multiple playthroughs: "I definitely expect people to go through this two or three times, but I think it's fun"

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: No relevant information found in this transcript
- Biobak: Appears to be involved in graphics/visual work, mentioned as providing feedback on visual elements and potentially helping with content creation
- Zeina: Identified as Kaze's personal partner/wife who cares for their baby, not a game development collaborator
- Other Contributors: No additional game development collaborators clearly identified in this transcript

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Major level redesign from complex maze to central room with multiple exits and instant warps to improve player navigation
- Camera system identified as primary technical challenge: "The one thing I'm actually most worried about in this area is the camera"
- Coin collection mechanics causing player experience issues: players might complete maze without collecting all coins, requiring replay
- Balancing complexity vs. accessibility: "It does feel maze like but because everything connects back to the main path it's like not that bad"
- First level design priority: "this is the first level this is going to be your first impression of the game it has to be absolute peak"

## Business Aspects
- Strong concerns about Nintendo takedown: expects game to last "like a week" before potential removal
- Developing strategies for copyright-free promotional materials to mitigate takedown impact
- Acknowledges free distribution model creates different player investment dynamics compared to paid games
- Recognition that takedown would impact visibility and fame more than personal consequences
- No mention of funding sources or monetization strategies

## Key Quotes
- "can you believe we're like on the last two courses it's crazy" - Shows proximity to completion
- "This is a really dangerous design, too... maybe I'm asking too much of the player" - Demonstrates player-first design philosophy
- "it would kill my views and stuff and it would stop the game from like becoming more famous, so that's the part that would suck" - Reveals concerns about Nintendo takedown impact on project reach

## Potential Interview Topics
- The decision-making process behind major design iterations and how player feedback influences development
- Strategies for navigating Nintendo's intellectual property concerns and the psychological impact of potential takedowns
- The technical challenges of adapting modern level design tools (Blender) for N64 development constraints
- How streaming development work affects the creative process and community involvement in design decisions
- The philosophy behind making ROM hacks that push technical boundaries while maintaining accessibility for casual players
