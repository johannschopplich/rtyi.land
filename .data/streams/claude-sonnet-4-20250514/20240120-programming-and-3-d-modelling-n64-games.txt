## Game Development Process
- Development began in mid-2020 and is well underway with multiple levels in various stages of completion
- Currently working on importing and refining levels, with the saloon/cowboy level being a focus area during this stream
- Has implemented new dialogue cutscenes and maintains a list of clips for future uploads
- The pirate ship level is mostly complete, missing only some jelly block animation frames
- Uses a 4-megabyte expansion which provides memory segmenting for 3-5% performance improvements
- Plans for the final version to have approximately 175 stars (up from current 165)

## Personal Insights
- Strong philosophical stance against traditional game monetization: "I actually think video games should not be monetized off of video game sales. I think that's a stupid concept. Because you can make free copies of your video game."
- Faces ongoing challenges with Nintendo: "My channel would be a lot more blown up if it wasn't for Nintendo trying to sabotage me. But it is what it is."
- Values community interaction and takes feedback seriously during development streams
- Expresses desire for authenticity in game presentation, wanting to include instruction manuals and proper packaging
- Shows perfectionist tendencies, frequently iterating on design elements until satisfied with quality

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Technical rendering issues requiring combiner adjustments: "I had to change a bunch of combiners because they all had environment color and it made everything look very dark"
- Camera system considerations between third-person and first-person perspectives, leaning toward full first-person for consistency
- Complex mission design for the saloon secret room involving chocolate milk smuggling and minecart chase sequences
- Balancing difficulty and player freedom while maintaining narrative coherence
- Texture and UV mapping challenges when working within N64 hardware limitations
- Room system implementation to manage performance and avoid lag

## Business Aspects
- Committed to free, open-source distribution: "I am not gonna sell the game, it will be downloadable for free. Yes, everything will be open source."
- Plans to monetize through merchandise rather than game sales: "I might sell a version of the game that is just the OST. So like just an OST cartridge and it's gonna come with a box and an instruction manual."
- Philosophy of selling "souvenirs about the game" rather than the game itself
- Over 70 videos have been taken down by Nintendo, impacting channel growth and visibility

## Key Quotes
- "I actually think video games should not be monetized off of video game sales. I think that's a stupid concept. Because you can make free copies of your video game."
- "So you can't buy the game, but you can buy a souvenir about the game. I mentioned not a lot of people are gonna buy it, but I think it's just gonna be really cool to have that exist."
- "My channel would be a lot more blown up if it wasn't for Nintendo trying to sabotage me. But it is what it is."
