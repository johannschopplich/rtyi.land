## Game Development Process
- Project is approximately 75% complete with nine levels remaining to finish
- Following systematic bug-fixing approach, currently stopped at course 4
- Working on multiple technical systems simultaneously: animations, level design, collision detection, sound systems
- Built on Mario 64 decompilation with significant new features and optimizations
- Team uses iterative development process with regular testing and refinement
- Project involves complex technical challenges including model exporters, texture formats, and animation systems

## Personal Insights
- Kaze has evolved his design philosophy from earlier projects, learning from past mistakes where he implemented ideas without considering player experience
- Strong belief that level design should prioritize excitement over difficulty: "I don't want difficulty. I want excitement"
- Advocates for purposeful design: "I think your level design should have purpose"
- Reflects on past approach: "my mindset at the time was like i have an idea so now i have two options one implement it to be lazy... that ended up making a few things not very good"
- Values efficiency and collaboration, willing to delegate work to focus on core development
- Has ambitious future plans beyond ROM hacking, including original IP development

## Collaborator Information
- Biobank: Graphics artist creating models, textures, and contributing to level design. Described as professionally educated game translator. Actively involved in design decisions and provides assets during streams.
- Zena: Animator working on character animations, specifically mentioned working on penguin animations and other character models. Uses new animation systems and tools.
- Rionno: Handling Spanish translation, described as professionally educated game translator alongside Biobank.
- Other Contributors: Multiple translators working on Portuguese and French versions, various community members providing feedback and support.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Implemented dynamic platform mechanics that respond to player speed for enhanced visual excitement without increased difficulty
- Removed instant pause-exit feature to prevent accidental level exits by inexperienced players
- Technical challenges with animation bone systems, moving from geo-bone to more efficient systems
- Sound system issues with positional audio when actors are too far from camera
- Balancing visual fidelity with N64 hardware limitations through texture format optimization
- Level design philosophy emphasizing visual spectacle and player engagement over pure challenge

## Business Aspects
- Strategic marketing plans using Twitter for promotion, already gaining significant engagement
- Future business model involving original IP development with Kickstarter funding
- Plans to hire team members including musicians (Zero Vault mentioned), level designers, and programmers
- Using Return to Yoshi's Island as advertisement/proof of concept for future commercial projects
- Leveraging existing social media following (32,000 Twitter followers mentioned) for marketing
- Considering multiple language releases to expand market reach

## Key Quotes
- "I think your level design should have purpose. You should move about in life of purpose and the purpose of this is to be a cool set piece. That looks cool to look at. Nothing else."
- "see my mindset at the time was like i have an idea so now i have two options one implement it to be lazy i was like no i'm just not gonna be lazy i'm just gonna if i have an idea i will put it into game and that's it no negotiations and that ended up making a few things not very good"
- "so we're gonna make the big bucks Return to Yoshi's Island you think it might be my biggest project ever it will be the advertisement"
