## Game Development Process
- Currently working on Course 11 ("Bowser's Tower" area, later renamed "Oily Boily Bay") with extensive level design and 3D modeling work
- Major overhaul from demo version: "So basically everything in this level has been completely reworked from the demo. It looks completely different. The framerate is higher. The level is better."
- Systematic improvement approach: "I've been making improvements to the game this week. Just like going back, fixing all the random stuff"
- Multiple course reworks completed: Deep Dives Through the Dorms, Turtle Street, Deep Sea Dive, and Bomb Cat's Secret have all been reworked
- Integration of new technical systems including revised camera controls and UI elements
- Long-term development timeline with 12+ years of programming/modeling experience informing the project

## Personal Insights
- Strong commitment to quality over viral appeal: "We're not adding a fucking Twitch emote here. Please. This is a game, not a meme... I want a game that keeps me occupied for the long term"
- Philosophical approach to programming education: "I think you should not learn C until you've learned assembly. Learning C before you've learned assembly is like explaining color to a blind person"
- Balances ROM hacking passion with professional responsibilities: "ROM making is not that lucrative, so I had to get a job other than that" (works as programmer at video game company)
- Values technical understanding and proper implementation over shortcuts
- Comfortable working long hours (mentions 70-hour work weeks) and has strong vision for the project

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: No relevant information found in this transcript
- Biobak: Active graphics artist collaborating on UI elements, particularly health meter design. Works iteratively with Kaze on color coordination: "Me and Biobank, we went through a lot of back and forth to get these colors exactly right." Provides texture assets and sprite work with attention to technical limitations.
- Zeina: Mentioned as animator and appears to be Kaze's romantic partner. Lives with Kaze and provides personal support during development. Referenced in context of quaternion animation systems.
- Other Contributors: Lila (working on quaternion system for smooth animations), active streaming community providing feedback and suggestions, various ROM hacking community members mentioned in passing

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Camera control overhaul to address input lag complaints: implemented C-stick and D-pad controls with different rotation speeds
- Breath meter balancing: intentionally shorter than vanilla Mario 64 to prevent unrestricted underwater exploration
- Technical optimization for N64 hardware: careful attention to polygon counts, texture resolution limits, and rendering performance
- Level naming process (collaborative decision-making, settled on "Oily Boily Bay" for its alliterative appeal)
- Color coordination challenges for UI elements to maintain visual coherence while respecting hardware limitations
- Performance optimization concerns: "this might just be the worst possible draw order" when discussing rendering efficiency

## Business Aspects
- Considering multiplayer mode development during upcoming two-week work vacation
- No specific monetization strategies mentioned
- ROM hacking acknowledged as non-lucrative hobby requiring separate income source
- Streaming serves as community engagement rather than primary revenue source

## Key Quotes
- "I want a game that keeps me occupied for the long term" - reflects Kaze's philosophy on creating meaningful, lasting entertainment rather than viral content
- "Learning C before you've learned assembly is like explaining color to a blind person" - demonstrates his deep technical philosophy and belief in understanding fundamentals
- "Me and Biobank, we went through a lot of back and forth to get these colors exactly right" - shows the collaborative, iterative nature of the development process

## Potential Interview Topics
- The evolution from demo to final version: What drives the constant reworking and how does the vision evolve?
- Balancing passion project development with professional game development career demands
- The collaborative process with artists and technical contributors, particularly the iterative feedback loops
- Technical innovation within N64 hardware constraints and the creative solutions required
- Philosophy on game design: creating lasting engagement versus immediate entertainment value
