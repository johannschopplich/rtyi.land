## Game Development Process
- Currently working on level 11 (oil rig level), indicating late-stage development: "So man it feels crazy that we're already in quest 11. We're actually just in the end game now for the mod."
- Following a methodical asset-creation approach: "So right now, our goal is to make a bunch of basic assets here. I've already noted down the ones we've made. And then these are the ones we still have to make. And then we combine them into platforming mechanics."
- Release timeline concerns due to time constraints: "Can you maybe release the game this year? Yeah, it's difficult to release it this year because we're only at close 11. I don't have that much time to work on this."
- Plans for potential multiplayer implementation during two-week vacation period
- Four remaining levels planned: comic book world, wild west world, casino world, and one other

## Personal Insights
- Strong philosophy against giving players too many options: "See, I'm kind of against giving players options. I think it's weird to give the player an option to like select how the fundamental thing like that works."
- Believes in player freedom over guided experiences: "I think games should be about experiencing freedom... I don't want the dev telling me, hey, do this, please."
- Confident coding approach: "See that's the thing with me. I never test my code. I just assume it works. And it saves me a lot of time. And usually it does."
- Perfectionist tendencies: "I want to release the game when it's actually completely finished."
- Influenced by other games like Mario Odyssey for lighting improvements

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: Composer creating custom OST for the game, with some Mario remixes included: "All of the OST is custom made by Badoop. So, it actually is not copyrighted. Well, actually, there are some remixes of Mario songs."
- Biobak: Graphics artist contributing to visual design decisions, particularly color schemes for levels
- Zeina: Animator and Kaze's partner, present during streams, working on character animations including walk cycles and contributing to design discussions
- Other Contributors: Lila/Leela (working on quaternion animations and has 16,500+ textures), Nata (created HD Worms Fortress)

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Implementing advanced lighting system inspired by Mario Odyssey: "Basically, I added the light coming from the camera back. So now all the moving objects are kind of colored in by the camera."
- Extensive use of fog for visual variety: "I added a lot of fog to this level because I think the fog adds so much visual variety."
- Creating complex platforming mechanics with multiple movement patterns for platforms
- Debugging issues with existing systems (ziplines broken during development): "I broke the ziplines. How and when? What the fuck?"
- Iterative color palette refinement for oil rig level to avoid confusion with lava/burning materials
- Optimization work on collision detection and rendering systems

## Business Aspects
- Transitioned from Twitch to YouTube streaming due to ad-related frustrations: "The reason I don't want to stream on Twitch anymore is that I find it personally unwatchable with all the ads."
- Plans to open source optimizations and potentially backport to vanilla Mario 64
- No concrete monetization strategy discussed
- Focus on quality over speed for release timeline

## Key Quotes
- "I think games should be about experiencing freedom. Am I giving you the line to move along? You don't have any freedom. You're just kind of following instructions."
- "See that's the thing with me. I never test my code. I just assume it works. And it saves me a lot of time. And usually it does."
- "I want to release the game when it's actually completely finished."
