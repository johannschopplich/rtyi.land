## Game Development Process
- The game is in active development with performance optimization being a major focus, running at 30+ FPS on actual N64 hardware
- Current work involves polishing visual elements, particularly desert/quicksand level aesthetics and background elements
- Technical implementation includes advanced graphics features like F3DX3 microcode and occlusion planes for performance optimization
- Development appears to be in later stages with level testing and visual refinement taking priority

## Personal Insights
- Kaze expresses strong pride in the visual quality, comparing it favorably to professional N64 games like Banjo-Tooie
- Shows frustration with YouTube's algorithm promoting drama content over meaningful game development content
- Demonstrates deep technical knowledge and passion for pushing N64 hardware limits
- Plans to release the game alongside an OST cartridge, showing commitment to a complete product experience

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: Composer who "wants to make all of it" (referring to the complete soundtrack), with Kaze noting the cut tracks are "very good"
- Biobak: Graphics artist who has been missing for a while and was supposed to help rework levels - Kaze expresses concern about his absence
- Zeina: Animator responsible for character animations, particularly "Boshi the Yoshi" 
- Other Contributors: Sauron (working on F3DX3 microcode optimization specifically for RTYI's performance bottlenecks)

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Major challenge balancing visual fidelity with N64 performance constraints, particularly in complex desert level scenes
- Design philosophy prioritizes maintaining visual coherence over easy technical solutions (e.g., refusing to fade elements to blue because it would make them "look like they're disappearing")
- Technical innovation includes custom RSP optimization to address memory and RDP bottlenecks unique to this project
- Level design incorporates sophisticated visual effects like parallax background elements and dynamic lighting

## Business Aspects
- A company has approached Kaze about making an N64 game in 2024, suggesting commercial interest in retro development
- Plans for OST cartridge release alongside the main game indicate merchandising considerations
- Marketing strategy discussion includes leveraging the novelty of "N64 game in 2024" with PC port availability for broader reach

## Key Quotes
- "So he's making a version of F3dx3 that has some optimized RDSP... we will likely see like an instant huge performance boost" - Shows the technical innovation happening for this project
- "I'm hoping that I can release RTYI alongside an OST cartridge" - Indicates comprehensive release planning
- "Do you guys actually think Banjo-Tooie looks as good as this? Because I just don't think so" - Demonstrates confidence in the project's visual achievements

## Potential Interview Topics
- The technical innovation behind optimizing F3DX3 specifically for RTYI and collaboration with Sauron
- The challenge of maintaining team cohesion when key contributors like Biobak go missing
- The philosophy behind visual design choices and pushing N64 hardware beyond typical limits
- Plans for commercial release and the unique position of developing new N64 games in 2024
- The role of community feedback during development streams and how it influences design decisions
