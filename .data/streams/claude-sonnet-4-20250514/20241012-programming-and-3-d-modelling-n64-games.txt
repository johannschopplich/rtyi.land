## Game Development Process
- The game is actively in development with multiple courses (13, 14, 15) in various stages of completion, with course 13 (ice castle) nearly finished, course 14 (craft world) mostly done, and course 15 (space arcade) still in early stages
- Demo preparation is underway with plans for multiple demo releases, including comprehensive testing on Nintendo 64 hardware
- Bug fixing and technical refinements are ongoing, particularly with lighting systems and object spawning mechanics
- The development uses Mario 64 decompilation as its technical foundation, which presents both opportunities and unique challenges

## Personal Insights
- Kaze prioritizes player experience above all else, willing to make significant design changes to prevent player frustration: "That's gonna be a miserable experience people are gonna hate that and I want to avoid that experience happening to anyone"
- He envisions an innovative economy system where coins will have meaningful impact on the game world: "You're actually gonna affect the world by giving people money. That's gonna be so cool"
- Balances accessibility with challenge, expressing concern that making the game too easy could diminish the treasure hunt experience
- Demonstrates deep technical knowledge while maintaining focus on user experience over technical complexity

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub**: No relevant information found in this transcript
- **Biobak**: Graphics artist working on environmental assets, specifically mentioned as creating "a line of mushrooms" that need to be implemented in the game
- **Zeina**: Animator mentioned as being present during the stream ("Zena in the house. She is in the house. Just chillin")
- **Other Contributors**: Active community of stream viewers providing real-time feedback on design decisions, including regular supporters like Davey who contribute through subscriptions

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Implemented a major structural change by adding a seventh star mission specifically for coin collection, departing from Mario 64's traditional six-star format
- Developed a sophisticated radar system inspired by Sonic Adventure 1, featuring proximity-based blinking and color-coding for collected items
- Addressed technical challenge where setting "beep harm free to 255" prevents object spawning in the Mario 64 engine
- Wrestled with UI design decisions around radar visibility, transparency, and visual feedback to balance functionality with aesthetics
- Created a global coin economy system where collected coins will enable world-changing purchases and upgrades

## Business Aspects
- Strategic demo release planning with multiple phases, starting with a comprehensive demo followed by a course-specific second demo
- Implementing protection measures to prevent players from accessing incomplete content through patches
- Regular streaming serves as both development documentation and community engagement/marketing tool
- No specific funding or distribution plans mentioned in this transcript

## Key Quotes
- "Trust me the coins are not gonna feel worthless the coins are gonna feel very cool. They're gonna feel more valuable than Mario Odyssey"
- "So I took the plunge and I made this change Instead of six stars. There's now seven stars in the act select and the last act is always called find the egg coins"
- "You're actually gonna affect the world by giving people money. That's gonna be so cool"

## Potential Interview Topics
- The evolution of the coin economy system and its intended impact on player engagement
- Collaborative workflow with remote team members (Biobak, Zeina) and how creative decisions are made collectively
- Technical challenges of working within Mario 64's engine limitations while implementing modern game design concepts
- The role of community feedback in shaping design decisions and the balance between developer vision and player input
- Long-term vision for the project and how it fits within the broader ROM hacking and fan game development community
