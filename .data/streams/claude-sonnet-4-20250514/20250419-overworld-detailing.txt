## Game Development Process
- The project has moved beyond demo releases: "I don't think there will be another demo. The next release will be the full game"
- Major technical overhaul in progress with sound engine rewrite achieving 80% performance improvement and quarter-size code footprint
- Overworld development is a massive undertaking: "This is the biggest level ever. This level will have like 30 stars or something like that"
- Support for 32 musical notes instead of vanilla's 16, enabling more complex compositions
- Advanced stage of development with Kaze expressing confidence: "So far I've always finished my hacks. So I'm very confident this one is going to get done soon"

## Personal Insights
- Kaze is surprised by public focus on optimization: "it's kind of weird to me that this whole project became so much about optimization in the public eye. But I guess it was bound to happen"
- Strong game design philosophy about post-completion gameplay: "You know what I kind of don't like in video games? The fact that you spend the whole video game saving the world. But then once you save the world, you're not allowed to explore the saved world"
- Maintains high confidence in project completion based on track record of finishing previous ROM hacks
- Values giving players agency to explore the world they've saved rather than resetting progress

## Collaborator Information
- Biobank: Graphics artist creating custom textures, though "not literally every texture is custom" yet; working on extensive visual overhauls
- 0VALT: Composer working on extensive musical content with "around 12 OVALT songs" created for the overworld alone, with music that fades between different areas
- Zeina: Kaze's wife who handles animations; they moved to Canada together after meeting in early 2020
- Other Contributors: DeathWizard (created Tetris program in Mario 64's music format), L-Ultra (stream participant), various texture artists planned for potential legal release

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Overworld design challenge balancing scale and content density: managing space between Yoshi Village and Bowser areas without creating empty regions
- Technical limitation overcome: vanilla Mario 64's inability to add sound effects properly, solved through custom sound engine
- Visual design iterations for mountain villages, wool warehouses, and environmental storytelling elements
- Post-game design philosophy: allowing players to explore the saved world rather than resetting to pre-completion state
- Legal considerations requiring all-custom textures for potential commercial viability

## Business Aspects
- Strategic release timing considerations: "I can't release this around the same time as Nintendo releases anything... Because if I do they will literally kill me"
- Revenue generation through sponsored video content: "I find sponsors and sponsors make videos for us and will pay you a lot of money"
- Legal pathway planning requiring custom texture creation: "if I want this to all be legal, I would technically need custom textures for everything"
- No specific release date commitment, prioritizing quality over timeline

## Key Quotes
- "I don't think there will be another demo. The next release will be the full game" - indicating advanced development stage
- "I want the player to save the world and then be like, yep, this is the world now. You saved it. Look at that" - core design philosophy
- "So far I've always finished my hacks. So I'm very confident this one is going to get done soon" - confidence in project completion

## Potential Interview Topics
- The evolution from optimization-focused content to comprehensive game development and how public perception shaped the project's direction
