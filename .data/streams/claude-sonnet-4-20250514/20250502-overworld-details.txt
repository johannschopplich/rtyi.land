## Game Development Process
- Active development focused on completing shader work for overworld sections and preparing levels for beta testing
- Working within strict technical constraints (64-megabyte ROM limit) while implementing quality-of-life improvements over the original Mario 64
- Development timeline spans approximately 5 years with limited time due to full-time job and YouTube obligations
- Beta testing process involves sending ROM to a single tester rather than wide distribution
- Implementing new features like cutscene skip functionality with hold-to-skip mechanics inspired by Breath of the Wild

## Personal Insights
- Kaze expresses confidence in his programming abilities, considering himself "at least a top 2% or 3% programmer" while critiquing the original Mario 64 code as "below average"
- Acknowledges time constraints from balancing game development with full-time Unreal Engine 5 work and YouTube content creation
- Takes a pragmatic approach to YouTube monetization, hiring editors and seeking sponsors to fund development
- Believes he will complete the project in less total time than the original Mario 64 development team despite working part-time
- Shows perfectionist tendencies while recognizing the need to iterate and improve over time

## Collaborator Information
- Biobank/Biobak: Graphics artist responsible for visual reworks and improvements. Kaze creates base shader work and ideas for Biobank to refine and perfect later
- Zeina: Animator working on cutscene skip button functionality and other interactive elements
- Akumoid: Shader development collaborator who worked with Kaze on reflective/metallic surface effects
- Other Contributors: Community Fast64 plugin developers, single beta tester, video editor hired for YouTube content

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Core design philosophy emphasizes making the overworld feel "placey" rather than "gamey" - avoiding traditional video game UI elements like level nameplates
- Focus on creating "aliveness and placeness" in the overworld through environmental storytelling and character placement
- Technical challenge of working within N64 hardware limitations while implementing modern improvements
- Balancing authenticity to the original game with quality-of-life enhancements and bug fixes
- Design decisions influenced by Yoshi's Story elements, including character interactions and mechanics

## Business Aspects
- Commercialized YouTube channel with sponsored content and hired editing staff to increase video output and revenue
- Estimated release timeline "before 2030" with no specific date commitment
- Considers various sponsorship opportunities, including controversial ones like gambling sponsors
- Beta testing limited to single person (99.9% of audience won't see beta), suggesting controlled pre-release strategy
- No mention of direct game monetization or distribution plans beyond completion

## Key Quotes
- "Really, the one thing we want to maximize with the overworld is the feeling of aliveness and placeness"
- "I do think, skill-wise, I'm at least a top 2% or 3% programmer. Knowledge-wise, probably not... I would say that the code I've seen in Mario 64 is below average, unfortunately"
- "I'm developing this game while I have a job, and I also have to make YouTube videos. So really, my time on this is quite limited"

## Potential Interview Topics
- The decision-making process behind technical constraints and how they influence creative choices
- Collaboration dynamics with specialized contributors (graphics, animation) while maintaining solo development control
- Balancing respect for the original Mario 64 with implementing modern improvements and personal vision
- The intersection of content creation and game development - how YouTube influences the project
- Long-term vision for the project's impact on the ROM hacking community and game preservation
