## Game Development Process
- The project is in advanced stages with 410 text boxes (almost 3x vanilla Mario 64 content) and only three levels remaining to complete
- Current focus is on finalizing animations, sound effects, and collision detection for existing levels
- Development follows an iterative process with community feedback integration: "it was a good thing I showed this to people before I started making this because people had a lot of really good feedback on it to make the platforming better"
- The team made a conscious decision early on to not target real hardware compatibility, allowing for more technical freedom

## Personal Insights
- Kaze has strong game design philosophies, particularly regarding exploration mechanics: "the thing about the 100 coin stars is I think the way 100 coin stars are done in Mario Sunshine is great and I know people hate them but hear me out"
- He's considering future projects beyond this ROM hack, including potential commercial work in Unreal Engine due to financial considerations
- Shows perfectionist tendencies regarding audio design: "I wanna go over the entire game at the end and make sure that the ambient everywhere is perfect"
- Balances technical ambition with practical constraints, acknowledging that "most likely it will be my own game made in Unreal Engine just cuz I have to think about the financial aspects as well"

## Collaborator Information
- Badub/Doop: Composer working on music for the Western dual scene and other tracks
- Biobak: Graphics artist responsible for level geometry and visual elements, with Kaze noting some remaining issues to be fixed
- Zeina: Animator creating character animations and cutscene work that Kaze is waiting for to complete certain features
- Other Contributors: No additional specific contributors mentioned by name

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Major design decision to replace 100-coin stars with Yoshi coins to encourage environmental exploration: "tying reward to that hopefully fuels that like sense of exploration"
- Implementation of complex NPC behaviors (bandit character with coin-stealing mechanics and multiple interaction states)
- Conscious choice to prioritize technical features over real hardware compatibility
- Focus on creating "three times as much content as vanilla mario 64" while maintaining quality standards
- Integration of multiple transportation systems (trains) with complex pathfinding and collision detection

## Business Aspects
- Ongoing payment processing issues with Patreon that lasted "one and a half years" before resolution
- Legal constraints preventing direct sales of ROM hacks: "I wish I could sell n64 games It's too bad I can't if only the law wasn't there to meddle with my affairs"
- Exploring YouTube sponsorship opportunities for monetization
- PayPal account issues preventing access to donated funds

## Key Quotes
- "we have 410 text boxes in this game now that's almost three times vanilla Mario 64... so we probably have three times as much content as vanilla mario 64 as well which is kind of insane"
- "the Yoshi coins are our replacement for the 100 coin stars... we have a lot of places where you can be creatively with the environment and we before you did the Yoshi coins so tying reward to that hopefully fuels that like sense of exploration"
- "Usually when someone makes a hack, at the very beginning they decide whether they wanna target real hardware or not. And then most of the time people say no. So, it is what it is."

## Potential Interview Topics
- The evolution of the Yoshi coin system as a design philosophy and how it differs from traditional collectible mechanics
- The collaborative process between team members and how roles were defined and distributed
- The impact of legal and financial constraints on creative decisions and project scope
- The decision to prioritize technical innovation over hardware compatibility and its implications
- The role of community feedback in shaping major design decisions and level geometry
