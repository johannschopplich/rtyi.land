## Game Development Process
- The project is actively progressing with multiplayer functionality being prepared: "I have prepared a lot of stuff that we need to do in order to get multiplayer in"
- Implementation of quality assurance through monthly course testing: "I think we're gonna bring back monthly course testing, where a player will just get to test one course at a time. Just to make sure the gameplay is good"
- The entire project will be open source: "Yeah, the engine will be completely open source. The entire hack here will be open source"
- Development follows an iterative model with constant refinement of existing levels and assets
- The team uses streaming as a development tool for real-time feedback and collaboration

## Personal Insights
- Kaze deliberately designs games with higher risk and challenge than modern commercial games: "I take a lot more risk in my game than like what you would see in a nintendo game... i think modern video games are just like frustration minimized"
- Strong independence and personal vision in development: "I'm not gonna ask anyone what they want made, I don't really care. I'm just making the hex that I want to make"
- Values authenticity over social expectations: "I don't like... just pretending... to care when I don't. Even if that would make me look like a good person"
- Finds joy in small gameplay improvements: "I honestly love that in this romhack. You can do a long jump. And instantly dive out of it. You can't do that in Mario 64. That one change. It's so fun for me"
- Has a philosophical approach to game design, viewing modern games as overly sanitized

## Collaborator Information
- Biobank (Graphics Artist): Primary 3D modeler and visual designer, currently reworking the zoo level extensively. Has taken over and improved models originally created by other team members. Mentioned as doing major visual overhauls across multiple levels including prison, aquarium, and Antarctic sections.
- Zeina (Animator): Working on character animations, specifically mentioned creating a dance sequence for Mario. Learning specialized animation techniques like foot shuffling for authentic character movement.
- Yoshi Milkman: Contributed IK rig technology that Zeina describes as "godsend" for animation work
- Vioback: Working on level assets, mentioned as having worked "on this for a while" regarding zoo contributions
- Other Contributors: Various community members provide feedback and testing, with plans for formal monthly testing volunteers

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Balancing difficulty vs. accessibility in the Antarctic plane section, with debate over timer length and obstacle collision
- Technical challenges with animation systems and collision detection requiring ongoing fixes
- Design philosophy emphasizing player challenge over frustration mitigation
- Implementing new movement mechanics like improved long jump to dive transitions
- Solving rendering and texture issues across multiple levels
- Creating coherent visual themes while maintaining gameplay functionality

## Business Aspects
- Plans to make the entire engine and hack open source upon completion
- Kaze mentions being under NDA for his next commercial project but provides no details
- No discussion of funding, marketing strategies, or monetization for Return to Yoshi's Island
- Development appears to be passion-driven rather than commercially motivated

## Key Quotes
- "I take a lot more risk in my game than like what you would see in a nintendo game... i think modern video games are just like frustration minimized they like design themselves in a way that there's no risk to anything"
- "I'm not gonna ask anyone what they want made, I don't really care. I'm just making the hex that I want to make. If you want something made, go make it yourself"
- "Yeah, the engine will be completely open source. The entire hack here will be open source"

## Potential Interview Topics
- Kaze's philosophy on game difficulty and his critique of modern game design trends
- The collaborative process with Biobank and how the visual rework evolved from initial concepts
- The decision to make the project open source and its implications for the ROM hacking community
- The technical challenges of implementing multiplayer in a Mario 64 engine modification
- The balance between maintaining the original Mario 64 feel while implementing new mechanics and levels
