## Game Development Process
- The game started development at the end of 2020, with Kaze noting that his previous game "Last Impact" took two years to complete
- Currently working on overworld design, specifically beach/island areas with water effects, sand textures, and decal layers
- Development follows an iterative approach where Kaze creates rough implementations that collaborators like Biobank later refine
- The overworld is designed to change throughout the game to make it "feel alive"
- Facing technical challenges with Fast64 bugs (export/import tool issues) and N64 memory limitations
- No specific release timeline established ("gets done when it's done")

## Personal Insights
- Kaze's game design philosophy: "Sometimes you just have to go with what your heart desires, you know? That's what game design is all about"
- Critical view of modern gaming graphics: Questions whether increased fidelity has taken away something special from games, comparing high-fidelity art to photography
- Prefers older game aesthetics, citing examples like Banjo-Kazooie's distinctive character voices over modern voice acting
- Admits to rarely playing games himself, with interest mainly in an Oblivion remaster
- Demonstrates perfectionist tendencies and attention to technical details, particularly around programming optimization

## Collaborator Information
- **Zayna/Zeina**: Animation artist creating textures like bunny footprints, works closely with Kaze on visual elements and takes direction for specific texture requirements
- **Biobank**: Graphics artist who refines Kaze's initial work, described as someone who will take Kaze's "semi decent" starting points and improve them significantly
- **Marty**: Audio contributor working on music, described as "basically done" but work not yet imported into the game
- **Other Contributors**: Sauron (working on legacy vertex pipeline for Fresno support), Laila (mentioned in context of a "random mode bug")

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Implementing coconut tree mechanics where players can kick trees to drop coconuts containing 0-5 coins, with potential for hitting sleeping characters
- Designing cave entrances to be clearly visible with character guards and bunny footprints as visual cues
- Struggling with realistic sand color and texture implementation for beach areas
- Creating water foam effects that align properly with sand textures
- Balancing visual fidelity within N64 hardware constraints, particularly texture memory limitations
- Designing the overworld to evolve throughout gameplay to maintain player engagement

## Business Aspects
- No established release date or marketing timeline: "Well, there is no release date yet. So, like, what do you want me to do? I don't know when it releases. It gets done when it's done"
- Development appears to be passion-driven rather than commercially motivated
- No mention of funding sources, publishers, or monetization strategies

## Key Quotes
- "The overworld changes throughout the game. It's supposed to feel alive." - Demonstrates the dynamic design philosophy
- "Sometimes you just have to go with what your heart desires, you know? That's what game design is all about." - Reveals Kaze's creative approach to development
- "What I'm doing is not the final version. I'm just getting something like semi decent going. So then when Biobank starts working on this, he has a good starting point." - Shows the collaborative iterative development process

## Potential Interview Topics
- The collaborative workflow between Kaze and his team members, particularly how rough implementations get refined by specialists
- Kaze's philosophy on balancing technical constraints with creative vision, especially regarding N64 limitations
- The decision to create a dynamic overworld that changes throughout the game and how this affects both technical implementation and player experience
- His views on modern game development trends versus classic game design principles, and how this influences his creative decisions
- The challenges of working with ROM hacking tools like Fast64 and how technical limitations drive creative solutions
