## Game Development Process
- Course 14 (pyramid/papercraft themed level) is nearly complete: "There's only two areas missing in the papercraft level and then Course 14 is complete"
- Course 15 is described as a "war level" and represents the most difficult content in the game
- Original demo development was rapid: "The original demo only took like 3 or 4 months. And it had 4 finished levels"
- Current timeline aims for end of 2024 release: "Like 2024? End of 2024? That's like the original timeline... but then we decided to polish it"
- A new demo featuring just Course 1 is planned for release

## Personal Insights
- Kaze has a strong design philosophy around "confusion resolution": "I want this to be more like confusion and then the confusion resolves, because you understand it... The difference is that there's no active effort required from the player. Rather, you just do the thing, and without really thinking about it, you suddenly understand it"
- He draws inspiration from Majora's Mask's design approach: "What I really like about Zelda is all the in-between... Majora's Mask formula is perfect"
- Shows ongoing concern about difficulty balance: "I feel like some of you guys might have trouble with this level" and frequently questions whether levels are too challenging
- Expresses frustration with technical limitations while maintaining creative ambition

## Collaborator Information
- Biobak: Graphics artist who provides feedback on visual design, specifically mentioned suggesting alternatives to Styrofoam textures like "cardboard where paper is stapled onto it"
- Zeina: Handles animations and serves as a playtester, with Kaze noting "when Zaina played and she had trouble beating it But I think the difficulty is fine considering its course 15"
- Kinokyo: Level designer/contributor praised by Kaze: "Kinokyo made this level so pretty"
- Other Contributors: Community members Parker, Chris, and James are referenced as active participants providing feedback

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Central challenge of designing a pyramid interior that feels maze-like but has an underlying logic that players can discover
- Implementation of a red coin collection system with shortcuts and strategic backtracking mechanics
- Balancing difficulty progression across courses, with particular attention to making challenging content fair rather than frustrating
- Technical rendering challenges with alpha transparency and wireframe display modes
- Aesthetic cohesion challenges with the papercraft/cardboard theme requiring creative texture solutions

## Business Aspects
- YouTube monetization generates modest income: "$900 this month. Or in a year, it's like... $10,000"
- Social media engagement tracking with mentions of Twitter impressions: "We got 1.4 million impressions"
- Discussion of optimal posting times for social media engagement
- Acknowledgment that ROM hacking doesn't provide substantial income compared to traditional game development

## Key Quotes
- "I want this to feel like a contrived cave system almost but not like a labyrinth"
- "I want the confusion from being overwhelmed with all the directions you can go... But then through being in here, I want the player to realize what's going on. And then be able to competently navigate the maze"
- "The original demo only took like 3 or 4 months. And it had 4 finished levels"
