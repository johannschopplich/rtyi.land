## Game Development Process
- The game is in active development with major systems still being implemented, as evidenced by Kaze working on the Bowser boss fight: "I've never seen this fight before we just started making this fight"
- Significant progress has been made since the demo release: "the actual final game is so unrecognizable from the demo right now it's actually crazy"
- The ROM is currently 44.6 megabytes with 32.1 megabytes dedicated to music, indicating substantial content development
- Ongoing technical optimizations are being implemented, including "the most correct sine and cosine function now...we're using imaginary numbers"
- Estimated timeline shows the game is still roughly a year from completion: "It's gonna be like at least another year before it just comes out"

## Personal Insights
- Kaze demonstrates strong personal preferences that influence design decisions: "I hate options. I think games should give you as few options as possible"
- He has high expectations for the game's impact: "This is gonna be a much bigger deal than Lost Impact...I think everyone's gonna love this game and that's gonna make its popularity skyrocket"
- Shows a pragmatic approach to work: "Why do you need motivation? Just do it"
- Reveals his selective taste in games: "I'm very picky with games" and emphasizes the importance of "that sense of freedom. That sense of skill expression" in platformers
- Demonstrates commitment to finishing the project despite other career opportunities

## Collaborator Information
- Zeina: Primary animator referred to as "My animation slave in the background" - actively working on character animations including Bowser, with plans for monthly animation showcases: "every month you'll see a new animation posted"
- Biobak: Graphics artist contributing model work, mentioned in context of providing tutorial bunny models and other visual assets
- "easy as pi": Discord community member who contributed mathematical optimization ideas, specifically imaginary numbers implementation for improved performance
- Other Contributors: Active Discord community providing feedback through polls and suggestions, influencing platform choice (YouTube vs Twitch) and development decisions

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Technical collision detection challenges with Bowser's movement: "he can't step up here so he does need to step up physics for this"
- ROM size constraints significantly impact development: "the 64 megabyte limit does affect us...32.1 megabytes is music because we have a lot of stream to music"
- Performance optimization is critical for complex objects: "If you have huge dynamic objects like a flying ship...that might be an issue on the CPU"
- Design philosophy emphasizes player freedom and skill expression over adventure/exploration elements
- Surface collision system required significant reworking to prevent "surface cocking or floor cocking" issues

## Business Aspects
- Strategic release planning to avoid Nintendo takedowns: "we should probably delay open sourcing the game a little from the initial release, just so Nintendo doesn't instantly take it down...Maybe like two months?"
- Revenue diversification through multiple platforms: "My youtube learns like a slight bits my patron is like the biggest income"
- Platform migration from Twitch to YouTube based on community preference and better revenue split: "YouTube is 70-30. It's another good reason to switch to YouTube"
- Kaze maintains financial stability through professional Unreal Engine development work while pursuing the passion project

## Key Quotes
- "the actual final game is so unrecognizable from the demo right now it's actually crazy" - Shows significant development progress and iteration
- "I hate options. I think games should give you as few options as possible, as little as you can get away with" - Reveals design philosophy prioritizing focused, curated experiences
- "This is gonna be a much bigger deal than Lost Impact...I think everyone's gonna love this game and that's gonna make its popularity skyrocket" - Demonstrates confidence in the project's potential impact
