## Game Development Process
- Demo release planned within 8 weeks maximum (ideally 3-4 weeks), featuring only Course 1 to gather feedback on new physics and camera mechanics
- Structured feedback collection through Google Doc questionnaires asking about autorotate, camera pan speed, physics preferences, and bug reports
- Video upload schedule: one video per week, with increased frequency planned around December
- Has an editor now, allowing for more consistent video production
- Currently in polish phase for demo, making visual improvements and level design changes

## Personal Insights
- Experiencing cognitive difficulties recently, feeling his "brain is really stupid" and unable to do basic math calculations
- Attributes mental fatigue to stress or aging, noting "maybe I was just stressed out for so long that my brain functionality is temporarily reduced"
- Became a father 4 weeks ago, which makes planning extremely difficult: "If you haven't noticed, I have a small child. That makes planning things really fucking difficult"
- Prioritizes community feedback: "I want more data on gameplay. I want more feedback for how people think the physics work and how the camera works"
- Strong opinions on game design: "I hate 100 coin stars in ROM hacks most of the time"

- Other Contributors: 
  - **Violet**: Contributed visual design ideas, specifically mentioned for suggesting certain color schemes
  - **Lila/Leela**: 17-year-old community member who provides regular feedback and suggestions on level design, appears to be Portuguese/English speaking
  - **Various community members**: Provide real-time feedback during streams on design decisions and technical issues

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Modified sliding physics: changed from hard cap at 100 speed to soft cap at 95 with asymptotic approach, allowing players to maintain momentum when sliding with high speed
- Replaced 100 coin stars with Yoshi coins system: "collect six of them and they can be collected anytime while you're doing another mission so you don't lose any progress"
- Converting pipe-based level transition to flower/vine climbing mechanic inspired by Yoshi's Island source material
- Ongoing challenges with visual cohesion: "something about the colours here just look really good, I think this is really colourful, but the colours don't really pop"
- Technical workflow disruptions due to Blender updates breaking established tools and processes

## Business Aspects
- Structured demo release strategy as marketing and feedback gathering tool
- Planned questionnaire system for collecting user data to inform final game design
- Jokingly mentions monetization: "I will send you 0.01% of the money the game makes off of sales, which is zero"
- Strategic video content planning to build audience leading up to demo release

## Key Quotes
- "I want more data on gameplay. I want more feedback for how people think the physics work and how the camera works and stuff like that. So that when I release the full game, we know for sure people like the camera and the physics."
- "If you haven't noticed, I have a small child. That makes planning things really fucking difficult."
- "I don't know what's up with me recently, but I've started to feel like my brain is really stupid for some reason, it's like sometimes it can't do the basics."

## Potential Interview Topics
- How has becoming a new father influenced your development process and priorities for Return to Yoshi's Island?
- Can you elaborate on your community-driven development approach and how viewer feedback shapes major design decisions?
- What technical innovations are you most proud of in this project, particularly regarding the physics modifications?
- How do you balance staying true to the original Yoshi's Island aesthetic while creating something new and unique?
- What are your long-term goals for the project beyond the demo release, and how do you plan to incorporate the feedback you receive?
