## Game Development Process
- The project has been in development for approximately 2.5 years, with Kaze noting significant progress in performance optimization: "This game also seems a lot more consistent than N64 now... we actually get decent FPS now"
- Currently working on a complex oil rig-themed level featuring protesting minions, with multiple mission structures and boss fight sequences
- The development includes sophisticated technical elements like particle systems, custom animations, and performance culling to maintain playable framerates on N64 hardware
- Planning future projects including a professionally-structured Ocarina of Time hack: "we'll do it like a professional game studio... with GitHub and a QA team and all those things"

## Personal Insights
- Kaze maintains strong opinions about quality control in ROM hacking: "I think just adding random memes to your hacks is just cringe. Unless it's specifically a meme hack, you should not do it"
- Shows dedication to authentic game design with attention to narrative coherence and player experience
- Expresses satisfaction with current development progress: "I'm really happy with the plan now"
- Demonstrates collaborative leadership style, actively seeking feedback and incorporating team member suggestions

## Collaborator Information
- Zeina: Lead animator working on complex character animations, particularly struggling with Wiggler rigging and creating protest animations for various characters
- Biobak: Graphics artist contributing textures, 3D models, and providing creative input on visual design decisions
- OST contributor: Mentioned indirectly through discussions of music tracks and cartridge plans (specific name not clearly stated in this transcript)
- Community contributors: Active chat participants providing real-time feedback on design decisions and technical suggestions

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Major focus on performance optimization while maintaining visual quality, achieving 25-29 FPS in complex scenes
- Innovative narrative structure featuring three-act missions with interconnected storylines about worker protests against Bowser
- Technical challenges with character rigging and animation systems, particularly for multi-segmented characters like Wiggler
- Creative use of AI tools (ChatGPT) for dialogue generation while maintaining quality standards through manual curation
- Strategic level design decisions including secret areas, collectibles placement, and boss fight integration

## Business Aspects
- Plans to sell physical merchandise including OST cartridges, boxes, and instruction booklets while avoiding trademark infringement
- Acknowledges legal constraints: "Cartridges will never be sold... you're gonna have to make a box with no name and no characters"
- Considering trademark licensing: "I might be able to buy them [samples] from the same place" as Nintendo
- Emphasizes the importance of legal consultation before any commercial activities
- No current monetization plans for the game itself, focusing on complementary merchandise

## Key Quotes
- "I think just adding random memes to your hacks is just cringe. Unless it's specifically a meme hack, you should not do it." - Shows commitment to maintaining artistic integrity
- "This game also seems a lot more consistent than N64 now... we actually get decent FPS now. Isn't that cool?" - Demonstrates pride in technical achievements
- "I was thinking we should develop like an Ocarina of Time hack... we'll do it like a professional game studio" - Reveals ambitious future plans and professional development approach
