## Game Development Process
- The project involves 30+ levels with Kaze currently working on Course 13 (ice castle theme) and planning Courses 14/15
- Level reordering is being implemented to ensure proper difficulty curve and that "players learn all the important controls everywhere"
- Art style testing phase is underway for new levels, with emphasis on getting the visual foundation right before detailed modeling
- Technical compatibility issues exist across multiple emulators, particularly Project 64, causing some levels to crash
- Design documents are being used to map out level progression, difficulty, and thematic variety

## Personal Insights
- Kaze views boss fights primarily as set pieces rather than gameplay challenges: "boss fights and video games. They're like zero fun for me. I think I can only appreciate boss fights as a set piece"
- Strong anti-puzzle design philosophy: "Puzzles is very much against the design of this game"
- Preference for platforming-focused gameplay over gimmicky mechanics
- Streaming personality differs from real-life demeanor: "The main reason I try to talk a lot on stream is that I'm trying to be a good streamer. In real life I do not talk very much"
- Technical perfectionism balanced with practical development needs

## Collaborator Information
- Wife: Creates art assets for the game, mentioned as ongoing contributor: "Yeah, my wife still makes art for this"
- Zeina: Handles animations, now works from separate office space: "Yes, Zeina is friend, true. I haven't seen Zeina in months. Yeah, she is in her own office nowadays. So, there isn't much reason for her to be in my background anymore"

- Biobak: No relevant information found in this transcript
- Other Contributors: SimpleFlips mentioned in context of emulator compatibility work; active community providing design suggestions through stream chat

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Level theme selection process involves avoiding repetition while maintaining variety across 30+ levels
- Course 15 designed as finale level that "should alter some convention that all the other 30 levels follow"
- Emulator accuracy issues creating development constraints: "Right now the game has a lot of issues on a lot of emulators. There isn't much I can do about it"
- Art style consistency challenges, particularly for ice castle environments requiring specific contrast and atmospheric effects
- Boss design prioritizing cinematic impact over traditional gameplay mechanics

## Business Aspects
- No relevant information found regarding marketing, funding, or distribution plans
- Some mention of sponsorship offers from gaming product companies that were declined

## Key Quotes
- "We want this to be kinda special. We want it to be something that allows for difficulty as well. It should alter some convention that all the other 30 levels follow" - On designing the finale level
- "So for me, the number one priority when we make a boss is to make sure it's a cool set piece" - On boss design philosophy
- "Starting on a new level is always the most difficult thing because there's so many things you have to keep in mind to try and make it look good" - On development challenges

## Potential Interview Topics
- The evolution of design philosophy throughout the project and how it shapes level creation decisions
- Workflow dynamics with collaborators, particularly the transition to remote/separate office work arrangements
- Technical problem-solving approaches when dealing with emulator limitations and compatibility issues
- The balance between community input and creative vision in the design process
- Long-term sustainability and completion strategies for such an ambitious scope (30+ levels)
