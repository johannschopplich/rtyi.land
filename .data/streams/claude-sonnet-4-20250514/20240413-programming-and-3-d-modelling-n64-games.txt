## Game Development Process
- Project is over 80% complete with only three courses remaining (Courses 13, 14, and 15)
- Course 12 was completed off-stream with only minor animations from Zeina remaining to be added
- Course 14 has already been started with a complete area that cannot be shown due to collaborative agreements
- Development follows a structured approach: blockout phase for level design, followed by 3D modeling, then UV mapping and aesthetic refinement
- Actively reworking previous areas like Divine Dino Domain (Course 2) to improve gameplay quality, removing sections that "sucked to play"
- Using Fast64 Blender extension for F3D export workflow

## Personal Insights
- Believes in learning through direct documentation reading rather than video tutorials: "All the tutorials people make on Blender are just a less efficient way to just reading their documentation"
- Has a pragmatic approach to development, prioritizing functionality over perfection: "Right now we just want the platforming to be fun. And then we can think about the visuals"
- Views coding as inherently understandable: "coding is pretty nice in that you can understand what most code does just by looking at it. It's made to be as understandable as possible"
- Shows dedication to practical problem-solving over aesthetic concerns during development phases
- Expresses frustration with technical limitations and tools that don't meet his workflow needs

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: No relevant information found in this transcript
- Biobak: Graphics artist, mentioned in context of aesthetic work but no specific details provided
- Zeina: Animator responsible for character animations in the game; also mentioned in personal context (hair cutting incident); animations are one of the final elements being added to completed levels
- Other Contributors: AkiDev (programmer who wrote Chain Chomp code that Kaze later modified for use in different levels)

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Redesigning Course 2's leaf bolt section due to poor gameplay experience, replacing autoscroll mechanics with platforming playground elements
- Technical challenges with water mechanics causing game crashes due to outdated step functions not being compatible with new systems
- Planning remaining courses: Course 13 as a "mysterious type ice castle," Course 14 as a "space arcade," with Course 15 still undecided
- Balancing difficulty progression, particularly concerned about making Course 2 platforming too difficult
- Managing technical debt from older code systems while implementing new features

## Business Aspects
- Active YouTube channel optimization including title changes to improve click-through rates (mentions changing from 7.4% to targeting higher rates)
- Monthly YouTube revenue mentioned as around $450 for primary channel
- Avoiding Patreon bonus content due to potential legal issues with Nintendo
- Planning release timing around SimpleFlips competition for maximum exposure
- Conscious of legal implications when working with Nintendo intellectual property

## Key Quotes
- "How much percent finished just above 80. We're getting there." - Shows project nearing completion
- "Right now we just want the platforming to be fun. And then we can think about the visuals." - Demonstrates priority on gameplay over aesthetics during development
- "coding is pretty nice in that you can understand what most code does just by looking at it. It's made to be as understandable as possible." - Reveals Kaze's philosophy on programming and learning

## Potential Interview Topics
- The decision-making process behind reworking existing levels versus creating new content from scratch
- How streaming and community feedback influences development decisions and priorities
- The technical challenges of working with Mario 64 decompilation and modernizing legacy systems
- Balancing creative vision with legal considerations when working with Nintendo IP
- The role of collaboration in a primarily solo development project and managing contributor relationships
