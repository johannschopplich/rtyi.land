## Game Development Process
- Kaze demonstrates significant weekly progress on a cowboy-themed level, showcasing multiple buildings and gameplay elements in various stages of completion
- The development follows an iterative approach with individual components being refined (train modeling, building placement, texture work) before final integration
- Performance optimization is ongoing, with the level currently running at "pretty stable, 40 to 50 fps" before full optimization
- Technical workflow requires collision detection to be baked at the end of level development before certain gameplay elements (like the moving train) can be fully programmed
- The project includes emulator detection features that automatically adjust settings (unlimited draw distance, 60fps vs 30fps) based on the platform

## Personal Insights
- Kaze shows deep commitment to thematic authenticity: "my dedication to the cowboy theme is still big, I started only watching cowboy tv shows while working on this, I am literally watching westworld right now"
- He expresses awareness of time limitations and mortality as motivation: "if I had infinite time. Sure, but I do not. Time is limited. We're all slowly dying. I gotta make what I can"
- Demonstrates passion for creative concepts, particularly excited about the "tumbleweed store" idea as "fucking hilarious"
- Shows strong opinions about game design philosophy, particularly regarding intrinsic vs extrinsic motivation in games
- Expresses focus on pushing technical boundaries: "I don't really care about raising the skill floor, I care about raising the skill ceiling"

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: No relevant information found in this transcript
- Biobak: Graphics artist who assists with texture improvements and visual elements. Kaze expresses trust in Biobak's ability to enhance textures, stating "Biobank says do not worry, he will make it better later. I will believe him"
- Zeina: No relevant information found in this transcript
- Other Contributors: Active community engagement through live chat providing feedback, suggestions, and technical questions during development streams

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Comprehensive cowboy town design featuring sheriff's office, bank, various stores (including a humorous "tumbleweed store"), and interactive elements like kickable tumbleweeds
- Technical challenge of creating appropriate 3D train model that fits the game's art style while maintaining performance
- Performance optimization strategies including texture management and collision detection workflow
- Gameplay design incorporating "three criminals you catch during the level" as part of the sheriff/bounty hunter theme
- Decision to maintain visual consistency while upgrading from original N64 assets to higher quality versions

## Business Aspects
- Concerns about YouTube video performance despite strong engagement metrics (11% click-through rate, 8-minute average view time)
- Discussion of YouTube algorithm challenges when content differs from typical channel focus
- Mentions Patreon integration through Payoneer for revenue management
- No specific information about game release plans, funding, or distribution strategies found
