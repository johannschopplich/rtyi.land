## Game Development Process
- Kaze is currently in active development of an ice castle level, focusing on platforming mechanics before visual polish: "Our task for the day is to make the platforming good. And then after we made the platforming good. We can make the visuals good."
- The development follows an iterative design approach, with Kaze constantly testing and refining level layouts and platforming sequences during the stream
- He has a strategic approach to source code release, waiting until completion to avoid premature exposure: "I released the source code whenever my mods done because if I release it before then I dig my whole mod so I don't want that"
- The project incorporates multiple interconnected areas within the ice castle, with complex routing for different stars and objectives
- Recent completion of a smaller collaborative project (Royal Scuttlebug hack) demonstrates ongoing productivity and ability to ship projects

## Personal Insights
- Kaze's design philosophy centers on emotional experience: "I think making a game is all about designing a feeling that you want the player to have"
- He values player agency and scalable difficulty: "the game is as difficult as you make it you always have the option to do something extremely risky extremely difficult to pull off that makes you go faster but you also have the option to take a safe route"
- His programming philosophy emphasizes practicality over complexity: "Programming is something you do to build something. The act of it itself should be as simple as possible"
- He shows perfectionist tendencies, repeatedly refining sections until they meet his standards
- Demonstrates technical curiosity about emerging technologies (AI upscaling, DLSS) while maintaining focus on N64 hardware constraints

- Zeina: No relevant information found in this transcript
- Other Contributors: 
  - Dan: Working on materials and lighting effects, though Kaze struggled to implement Dan's more advanced techniques
  - Eiza: Collaborative partner on Royal Scuttlebug hack, handled most of his own content while Kaze managed programming and shaders
  - Sauron: Created performance tracing tools that Kaze plans to integrate for optimization
  - Easy As Pie: Created GCC fork used in development

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Camera system presents significant challenges in tight indoor spaces, requiring careful level geometry planning
- Balancing slide mechanics and platforming flow while maintaining player orientation and clear objectives
- Technical limitations around mirror effects and visual fidelity on N64 hardware
- Level interconnectedness design to allow multiple routes and backtracking without confusion
- Iterative refinement of jump distances, platform placement, and visual clarity for player guidance
- Texture and material work to achieve desired ice castle aesthetic within hardware constraints

## Business Aspects
- Strategic approach to source code release timing to protect project integrity
- Previous monetization success with Valuigi's Tango Stand cartridge ($600 revenue, $400 profit after RetroBlaster investment)
- No specific marketing strategy or funding discussions mentioned in this transcript
- Demonstrates sustainable development approach through smaller collaborative projects

## Key Quotes
- "I think making a game is all about designing a feeling that you want the player to have and that just doesn't fit the feeling of this area."
- "I feel like that's kind of the idea with Mario 64 so the game is as difficult as you make it you always have the option to do something extremely risky extremely difficult to pull off that makes you go faster but you also have the option to take a safe route"
- "I released the source code whenever my mods done because if I release it before then I dig my whole mod so I don't want that I don't want people to just you know take my mods because if people play it early they're not gonna like it"
