## Game Development Process
- Project is in advanced stages with Course 14 being worked on and approaching demo release for Course 1
- ROM size has reached 63MB, approaching the 64MB N64 limit, indicating substantial content completion
- Performance optimization is ongoing with benchmarks showing ~50 FPS and 73% CPU idle time on N64 hardware
- Demo release will feature "just one stage, nothing more" as an initial public release
- Development follows a pattern of visual rework first, then collision and actor implementation

## Personal Insights
- Kaze believes this is "the prettiest N64 game there is" and that "you can't really make an argument against that"
- Streams primarily for community feedback rather than professional content creation: "I'm not trying to be like a professional streamer... So I will not do anything except the bare minimum"
- Has a provocative philosophy about game quality: "I hate video games, which is why I'm trying to make a good one, because I think all of the ones are bad. Trying to make the first good video game"
- Strong commitment to N64 authenticity: considers going over 64MB "kind of lame" and "like cheating" because "you're going beyond what they were able to do at the time"

## Collaborator Information
- **Biobank**: Primary 3D artist responsible for level reworks and character model updates. Recently completed Course 1 rework and various enemy models (Goomba King, Spike Goomba, Bouncy Flower, etc.). Works in modern 3D tools, requiring Kaze to handle N64-specific technical implementation and collision work
- **Bandu**: Composer creating adaptive music with "versions for every biome" that "smoothly fade mini-channels in and out" based on level sections. Has produced multiple tracks including grass area and pyramid themes
- **Badub**: No relevant information found in this transcript
- **Zeina**: No relevant information found in this transcript
- **Other Contributors**: Active chat community providing real-time feedback during development streams

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Implemented innovative physics-based animation for Mario's nose using "genuine physics bone" with pendulum physics calculations
- Workflow challenges between modern 3D modeling tools and N64 hardware constraints: "Biobank is not modeling directly on the N64, he's not gonna know what's going on"
- Rendering order and layer management issues requiring careful optimization for N64 display limitations
- Billboard rendering system designed specifically for spherical objects to maintain performance
- Balancing visual improvements while maintaining authentic N64 performance and memory constraints

## Business Aspects
- Revenue comes from "YouTube and Patreon" but "it's not even half of what my normal job makes"
- No specific marketing or distribution strategy mentioned beyond demo release
- Project appears to be primarily passion-driven rather than commercially focused

## Key Quotes
- "I'm pretty sure this already is the prettiest N64 game there is. I don't think you can really make an argument against that."
- "But if you go over 64 MB, are you really still making an N64 game?... It just feels like cheating to me."
- "Really I just stream because I want to stream and because I like having people be able to give me feedback on this."

## Potential Interview Topics
- The technical philosophy behind maintaining N64 authenticity while pushing visual boundaries
- Collaboration workflow challenges when modern artists create content for retro hardware limitations
- The innovative physics systems and technical breakthroughs achieved in the Mario 64 engine
- Community-driven development through streaming and real-time feedback integration
- The artistic vision behind creating what Kaze considers the "first good video game"
