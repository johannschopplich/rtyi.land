## Game Development Process
- The game is nearing completion: "It's all RTYI and it's getting close to completion. Please stop asking me for release dates. I will literally lose my mind."
- Extensive performance optimization has been a major focus, with Kaze claiming the game now runs "like twice as fast again" since previous development videos and achieves 30 FPS on actual N64 hardware
- The final game will be exactly 64 megabytes, utilizing the full capacity of an N64 cartridge
- Current work involves bug fixing and optimization on Course 15, specifically dealing with snow effects and memory allocation issues
- Kaze claims this will be "the first quadruple A N64 game ever" as a marketing angle
- Development involves extensive technical deep-dives into vertex buffers, memory management, and rendering optimization

## Personal Insights
- Kaze expresses significant frustration with community pressure: "Please stop asking me for release dates. I will literally lose my mind"
- Views game development as a passion project that generates income: "I just want to make games, man" and describes it as "my thing as a hobby that makes money"
- Main profession is programming for a company, with this being a side project
- Demonstrates perfectionist tendencies, particularly around performance optimization and technical implementation
- Shows frustration with external limitations, especially emulator compatibility issues
- Expresses pride in the technical achievements: "it genuinely is 10 times the performance of normal vanilla Mario 64"

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: No specific information mentioned in this transcript
- Biobak: Graphics artist who provides optimization suggestions and feedback on visual elements; mentioned in context of styrofoam texture suggestions and level design decisions
- Zeina: Animator whose friends helped install N64 Digital mod hardware; suggests ongoing technical collaboration beyond just animation work
- Other Contributors: Lera (potentially working on 3D models, specifically peach models mentioned as pending work)

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Major technical challenge involves emulator compatibility, particularly with Project 64, Parallel Launcher, and Mupen64, with different emulators having various compatibility issues
- Level design focuses on platforming sections with tilting bridges, zippered areas leading to "hell," and carefully balanced difficulty progression
- Art direction emphasizes a cardboard/paper aesthetic with stapled elements, moving away from complex normal-mapped styrofoam to simpler, more performance-friendly materials
- Performance optimization is the primary constraint driving design decisions, with constant balancing between visual fidelity and frame rate
- Memory allocation and vertex buffer management present ongoing technical challenges requiring low-level optimization

## Business Aspects
- Considering Steam release if Mario assets are removed to avoid Nintendo legal issues: "If I were to release this game on Steam, obviously I would have to remove all the Mario assets though"
- Pricing strategy under consideration: "$20? $10? I'm not sure. I'll have to think about it. Do some market research, ask people how much they would be willing to pay"
- YouTube content creation serves as funding mechanism for development
- Acknowledges Nintendo lawsuit risk: "Won't Nintendo sue?" with awareness that removing Mario assets would be necessary for commercial release
- Twitter engagement experiments for additional monetization: mentions reply getting "7,000 views" and calculating ad revenue

## Key Quotes
- "It's all RTYI and it's getting close to completion. Please stop asking me for release dates. I will literally lose my mind."
- "I just want to make games, man."
- "I'm going to say this is the first quadruple A N64 game ever. That's going to be the marketing."
