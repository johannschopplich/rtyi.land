## Game Development Process
- Game is in active development with significant progress made offline: "Dude, I made so much progress while I was offline. You guys have no idea. There's so many changes."
- Beta testing phase has been completed with resulting adjustments: "I also was finally able to get the romhack properly beta tested, so from that I made a lot of adjustments to the game."
- Currently working on detailed mechanics like butt print/footprint systems in cement surfaces
- Multiple stages are being refined with bug fixes: "I also fixed so many bugs in the first few stages."
- N64 compatibility testing reveals performance challenges: "I tested the game on N64 and while it runs super well when it runs, there's still a lot of crashes, like a lot of them."
- Planning major overworld remake with coin collection and store system

## Personal Insights
- Kaze describes a pragmatic, intuitive approach to programming: "My motto, my mantra is that if the compiler doesn't see a difference, I also don't see a difference. So code style is just not a thing for me."
- Claims natural programming ability: "I literally just looked at code and was able to program. I have never learned it. I was just born with it."
- Focuses on creation over social interaction: "I just want to not have to deal with all this being a human and asking questions and being social stuff. I just want to get stuff done."
- Acknowledges financial sacrifice for the project: "It's not for free. I mean, technically I make a little bit of money from it, but I would make a lot more money if I just did literally anything else with my skills."
- Expresses desire for recognition: "I want to push my own channel. I want to get famous."

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: No specific information mentioned in this transcript
- Biobak: Referenced as "Biomech" - collaborated on overworld remake planning via Discord DMs: "I've had some arguments with Biomech and Discord DMs about how to best do this. And I think we've come to a pretty good agreement."
- Zeina: Active animator providing assets including butt print textures and Wario animations: "I'm pretty sure Zayna sent me the butt print" and "I also sent you all of Wario's animations. Nice, nice. Including a funny little walk cycle."
- Other Contributors: Lila (general helper, sends videos and assistance), SimpleFlips Discord community (provides resources and feedback), various stream viewers offering real-time suggestions

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Implementing interactive environmental mechanics: "We're gonna give Mario a butt print that appears when you do a ground pound here. And maybe something that appears when you dive."
- N64 hardware optimization is a constant concern: "I'm kind of worried that this level is going to lag on N64 but I guess that happens with every level I make."
- Redesigning classic enemies (Toxboxes) to fit new oil rig theme using AI assistance for creative inspiration
- Overworld progression system design: "coins you collect and you store them globally, right? And then in the store, you'll be able to buy different stuff"
- Character modeling challenges balancing detail with polygon constraints: "this whole thing is 328 triangles, so... I don't think we can really afford much more polys here."

## Business Aspects
- Distribution uncertainty due to Nintendo considerations: "When release date? I don't know. Nintendo will let me distribute this and I will just upload a patch and then we can play that."
- Revenue generation through streaming and content creation, though limited compared to potential commercial work
- Platform strategy considerations (YouTube vs Twitch for streaming)
- Community-driven development approach with real-time feedback during streams
