## Game Development Process
- The game is in an iterative development phase, with Kaze stating: "we should make like one or two more hacks on the RTYI engine before RTYI is released just to like get everything a little bit improved"
- Utilizing playtest data from "only up 64" to inform RTYI development decisions and improvements
- Major physics overhaul in progress: "I reduced the outer rotate force and I changed a lot of the physics and I think they're working a lot better now"
- Addressing memory leaks and performance optimization: "what's leaking memory too many condition triangles"
- Working on specific game mechanics including ceiling interactions, warp systems, and character animations
- The game runs at 60fps compared to original Mario 64's 30fps, which affects input lag and gameplay feel

## Personal Insights
- Kaze expresses frustration with mixed community reception: "the reception of the current rtyi engine is very mixed I find some people say they love it others say they hate it"
- Strong belief that community criticism is influenced by nostalgia: "there's definitely a rose tinting with vanilla Mario 64 collision"
- Philosophical approach to hack development: "if you're good at Mario 64, there's going to be many random things in your game that you won't notice that casual players will have huge problems with"
- Migrated from Twitch to YouTube streaming due to excessive advertisements affecting viewer experience
- Views himself as "the best optimization guy" for Mario 64 while acknowledging others may have broader N64 knowledge

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: Composer working on OST, with Kaze mentioning "Any OST wishes for today" and discussing music selection during development
- Biobak: Graphics artist contributing to visual elements and providing feedback on design decisions
- Zeina: Animator responsible for character animations, specifically working on Wiggler animations and penguin character movements
- Other Contributors: Arthur (community member seeking moderation status and providing development input), Robert (created mirror breaking engine), Nathaniel Bandy's editor (mentioned in relation to video content)

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Complete redesign of warp system: "I'm gonna completely change the warps so what I'm gonna do is that let's let's just enter warp here so right now what happens when you enter warp is like it just does that which I don't like"
- Ceiling interaction improvements to prevent exploits while maintaining Mario 64 feel
- Innovative Wiggler boss design as an "overseer" character on an oil rig level with progressive anger mechanics
- Development of cement destruction system with percentage tracking for easter eggs
- Balancing N64 hardware limitations with enhanced physics and visual effects
- Maintaining authenticity to Mario 64 mechanics while addressing known issues

## Business Aspects
- Strategic platform migration from Twitch to YouTube for better creator experience and audience reach
- Exploring Twitter monetization opportunities but facing threshold requirements (5 million impressions needed)
- Casual mention of improved financial situation after moving to Canada
- No specific release timeline or distribution strategy discussed beyond completing engine improvements

## Key Quotes
- "we should make like one or two more hacks on the RTYI engine before RTYI is released just to like get everything a little bit improved"
- "the reception of the current rtyi engine is very mixed I find some people say they love it others say they hate it"
- "there's definitely a rose tinting with vanilla Mario 64 collision a lot of people were looking at some of the bugs in RTY or not the bugs some of the oddities in the collision in RTY and it was just like yeah this is a vanilla thing that's just how Mario 64 works bro"

## Potential Interview Topics
- The decision to create multiple test hacks before RTYI release and how playtest data influences development
- Managing community expectations and criticism while staying true to the original Mario 64 feel
- The technical challenges of enhancing Mario 64 physics while maintaining N64 compatibility
- The collaborative process with artists and animators, particularly the remote coordination of assets
- The philosophy behind balancing accessibility for casual players versus experienced Mario 64 veterans
