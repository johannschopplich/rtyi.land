## Game Development Process
- The game is approximately 70% complete, with "four and a half courses" remaining to be finished
- Significant technical progress this week with a 5% render speed improvement (from 44 FPS to 46 FPS)
- Engine improvements implemented to make adding shadows and culling radiuses easier across all game elements
- Active development on specific level mechanics, including oil block physics and death/respawn systems
- Working on enhanced star select screens to improve the game's presentation and user experience

## Personal Insights
- Kaze demonstrates deep technical expertise and takes pride in optimization work, stating "this week was insane I found so many improvements"
- He shows strong opinions about programming practices, particularly criticizing visual scripting languages like Blueprints in favor of traditional coding
- Expresses satisfaction with collaborative elements: "imagine entering this level for the first time imagine you come from Mario 64... you're all innocent you think I was just gonna be a normal game and then you see this"
- Values performance and technical polish, spending considerable time on frame rate optimization and rendering improvements
- Shows attention to player experience, carefully considering respawn mechanics to avoid disorientation

## Collaborator Information
- Biomech/Biobak: Graphics artist creating 3D models, textures, and star select screen designs. Kaze frequently seeks their input on visual elements and layout decisions
- Zeina: Animator who has visited Kaze in person (mentioned they went to see seals together when "Zeyna was over here")
- Other Contributors: Robot and Arthur (Discord collaborators), Atlas (unclear role), community members providing feedback and suggestions through chat

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Implementing sophisticated respawn mechanics that avoid placing Mario in dangerous or nonsensical locations after death
- Balancing authentic Mario 64 feel with new mechanics like oil physics and environmental hazards
- Technical challenge of optimizing Mario 64's original culling system, which "was fucked" and culled incorrectly
- Camera system design philosophy focusing on intuitive controls without complex button combinations
- Performance optimization while maintaining visual quality and 60 FPS target

## Business Aspects
- YouTube content strategy mentioned with concerns about video scheduling conflicts affecting view counts
- Reference to main channel videos and shorts channel management
- Brief discussion of programming industry salaries (though not directly related to the game's monetization)

## Key Quotes
- "how close am I to finishing the mod we're missing like four and a half courses so we're like over 70% done at this point"
- "this week was insane I found so many improvements literally I reduced render time by like 5% almost"
- "imagine entering this level for the first time imagine you come from Mario 64... and then you see this and then you enter the level and the cuts in place oh that's gonna be so impressive"

## Potential Interview Topics
- The technical challenges of optimizing a Mario 64 ROM hack while maintaining authenticity to the original game
- The collaborative process between Kaze and his team of artists/animators, particularly how remote collaboration works
- The decision-making process behind maintaining 60 FPS performance vs. adding new visual features
- How community feedback influences development decisions and the balance between creator vision and player input
- The evolution from initial concept to the current 70% complete state and what the final 30% entails
