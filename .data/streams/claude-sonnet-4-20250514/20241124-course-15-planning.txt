## Game Development Process
- Currently working on Course 15 ("Space Arcade"), described as "the last main course" and "the biggest level we have" space-wise
- Demo release planned for "shortly after Christmas" or "first of next year" to avoid Nintendo's negative reaction to Christmas releases
- Demo will be released on "Case Clips channel, not on the main channel"
- Game runs at "stable 60 FPS on N64" even with all enhancements enabled
- Engine demonstrates impressive technical achievement: "That's just how powerful the engine is"
- Plans to open source the engine after game completion to avoid leaking the full game early
- Mario expansion project being worked on "very slowly" in parallel

## Personal Insights

- Emphasizes "Fun, freedom" as core design philosophy and "the through line" for the project
- Shows deep concern about player experience: "Most important order of business, do not ever have the player question what to do"
- Wants to create "the pure Bing Bing Wahoo level" that evokes awe and wonder
- Demonstrates strategic thinking about Nintendo's reactions and release timing
- Values technical achievement and N64 compatibility as important project constraints

- Space Arcade level design goals: "put the player in awe," "evoke awe with visuals/lights," create space adventure experience
- Considering dynamic level layouts that change based on which star/act the player is pursuing
- Planning various arcade game mechanics: Pac-Man variant with Chain Chomps, Tetris survival challenge, skateball, flipper mechanics
- Enemy design includes "space shy guys" and "space skeetas" as alien variants of existing Mario enemies
- Addressing wing cap placement to prevent trivializing level challenges
- Technical constraint of maintaining N64 compatibility while maximizing visual impact

## Business Aspects

- Plans for open source engine release after game completion
- Previous sponsorship experience with Roblox mentioned as context for funding approach
- YouTube channel strategy differentiating between main channel and Case Clips for demo release

## Key Quotes
- "Most important order of business, do not ever have the player question what to do. The player always needs to know the way forward I think."
- "I am planning to open source it. The problem is if I open source it right now I'm going to open source it with my entire game. And I don't want to leak my entire game early before it's done."
- "We definitely want Fun, freedom. This is the through line. And we need a way that you're going to feel like you're an adventure into space."
