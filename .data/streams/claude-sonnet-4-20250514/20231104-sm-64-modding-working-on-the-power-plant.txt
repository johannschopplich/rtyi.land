## Game Development Process
- Currently in active development phase, working on programming platforms and elevators for the power plant level
- Performance optimization is ongoing: "We went from 43 to 45 fps to the range of 45 to 49 fps And then I fixed some culling thing and now the fps are down to 47 again, but still"
- Plans for pre-release demos: "before our tyi's release. I do want to release one or two more demos where people can just Play test the physics and stuff so we should do that"
- Game is built on Mario 64 decompilation, allowing for significant modifications and optimizations
- Level design is progressing with focus on enemy placement, mechanics, and visual effects

## Personal Insights
- Kaze expresses frustration with constant release date inquiries: "I hope we can go a whole stream without people asking me for release dates every 15 minutes that would be pretty nice"
- He's moved to a new location and now works from a basement: "I recently moved I don't know if you know about this and now I'm in a new location... I'm a basement dweller now"
- His audience has shifted more toward programmers: "I feel like a lot of programmers watch my channel now and not so much the casual audience ever since the source code revert"
- He maintains employment at another company but can't discuss details due to HR restrictions
- Shows dedication to quality over speed, wanting to perfect physics and camera before full release

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: No specific information found in this transcript
- Biobak: Graphics artist responsible for textures and visual polish - "this whole area is gonna be ugly until biobank gets to it just because I Can't really change many things right now Without knowing the exact textures"
- Zeina: Animator working upstairs while Kaze works in basement - "Zena is finally out of my hair she is upstairs now and I'm downstairs" and "Zena's in a different room now she's upstairs and I'm downstairs"
- Other Contributors: Mario (mentioned for texture work), UAD (referenced for previous level collaboration)

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Developing oil fuzzy enemies with trippy visual effects that affect gameplay: implementing screen distortion, slippery controls, and rainbow visual effects
- Balancing difficulty progression and camera system improvements: "I released issues with the camera I noticed issues with the side flip and I feel like I want to release at least one egg where it's like this is all perfect"
- Strategic Yoshi coin placement to avoid frustrating backtracking: "I want the Yoshi coin to be in the first room here. So let's do that. That you don't have to do half the star again if you miss the Yoshi coin"
- Performance optimization challenges while maintaining visual quality and 60fps target
- Designing breakable objects and environmental puzzles for the power plant level

## Business Aspects
- ROM distribution strategy discussed, mentioning various patching tools and methods
- Cannot justify full-time development without financial incentive: "I would like to do ot next but I need financial incentive I can't just do it it would be irresponsible"
- Demo release strategy to test mechanics and gather feedback before final release
- Content creation for YouTube as part of broader strategy, balancing technical content with accessibility

## Key Quotes
- "I feel like I want to release at least one egg where it's like this is all perfect And then I put our tyi out because once I have our tyi out I can't really change anything anymore that much"
- "We went from 43 to 45 fps to the range of 45 to 49 fps And then I fixed some culling thing and now the fps are down to 47 again, but still"
- "this whole area is gonna be ugly until biobank gets to it just because I Can't really change many things right now Without knowing the exact textures"

## Potential Interview Topics
- The technical challenges and innovations of working with Mario 64 decompilation for ROM hack development
- Team coordination and workflow between remote collaborators (Kaze, Biobak, Zeina) across different specialties
- The balance between creative ambition and technical limitations when developing for N64 hardware
- The evolution of the ROM hacking community and distribution methods in the modern era
- The decision-making process behind demo releases and community feedback integration
