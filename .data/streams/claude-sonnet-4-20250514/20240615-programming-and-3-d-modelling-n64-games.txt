## Game Development Process
- Currently working on importing and integrating assets for a level remade by collaborator Biobank, with active development on visual effects like sparkles and lighting
- Game features 15 worlds total, with Crystals 14 planned as "Space Casino" and Crystal 15 as "Paper Craft level made entirely out of cardboard and stuff"
- Following structured development schedule: planning to finish boss area and factory elements over the weekend, then return to previously stalled ice castle level next week
- Working through organized to-do list including camera systems, particle effects, bug fixes, and collision detection improvements

## Personal Insights
- Strong opinions on game design, particularly hatred for Mario Sunshine due to excessive cutscenes that interrupt gameplay flow: "every single time the game takes control away from me, it just feels like a small kick to my balls"
- Pragmatic approach to development challenges: "I have accepted that most code is written pretty unoptimized"
- Deliberate design philosophy focused on player experience over punishment: "I don't want that to be that punishing for no reason" when discussing death mechanics
- Personal gaming experiences directly influence design decisions and creative direction

## Collaborator Information
- Biobank (Graphics Artist): Creating level remakes and assets, actively involved in providing feedback during development streams, still working on additional assets for current level
- Zeina (Animations): Responsible for animation work, mentioned needing to send updated animation files, appears to be younger collaborator with parental supervision
- Other Contributors: Additional team members referenced but not specifically identified in this stream

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Balancing difficulty and accessibility: choosing respawn with health loss over instant death for oil hazards to avoid excessive punishment
- Working within N64 hardware limitations and dealing with emulation bugs that can't be fixed: "We have a really unfortunate render bug here... Nothing we can do about that"
- Implementing visual polish through lighting effects, particle systems, and environmental details while managing memory constraints
- Maintaining gameplay flow and avoiding interruptions that break player immersion

## Business Aspects
- No relevant information found regarding marketing, funding, or commercial distribution plans

## Key Quotes
- "I was working on this level here that Biobank remade. I imported all the assets and there's some assets Biobank still wants to make. But so far so good, I would say."
- "I think there should be a death animation at place when my fault's in the oil you can just respawn with less health. I don't want that to be that punishing for no reason, you know"
- "Next up would be the boss area and then all the the factory stuff. Hopefully I can finish that this weekend and then next week we can finally go back to the ice castle where we've been stuck for a bit"
