## Game Development Process
- Active development of an ice castle level with multiple platforming mechanics and visual effects being implemented
- Iterative design approach with constant refinement based on testing and community feedback during live streams
- Working with Mario 64 decompilation as the base engine, focusing on level design and gameplay mechanics rather than core engine work
- Stream demonstrates real-time problem-solving and design decision-making as part of the development workflow
- Development appears to be in mid-to-late stage with core mechanics established and focus shifting to level-specific content

## Personal Insights
- Kaze demonstrates strong perfectionist tendencies, unwilling to compromise on visual quality or gameplay experience ("You can't tell me that this is not the coolest thing ever")
- Shows innovative problem-solving mindset, willing to invent new techniques when existing solutions don't meet his standards ("I made it up... I invented this pattern")
- Expresses frustration with software ecosystems that force updates and introduce new bugs, preferring stability over new features
- Views this ROM hack project as preparation and marketing for future original game development: "this will be pretty insane advertisement for whenever i do my own game"
- Displays strong commitment to completing the project before moving on to original games

## Collaborator Information
- Zayna/Zeina: Animation contributor who appears to be physically present during development sessions, actively involved in day-to-day development process
- Samah: Graphics contributor who provides visual feedback and suggestions during streams, consulted for artistic decisions
- Biobak: Graphics artist mentioned in relation to 3D modeling work and potential geometry optimization issues
- Other Contributors: Active community of stream viewers who provide real-time feedback, suggestions, and testing during development streams

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Central design philosophy of showing players objectives (stars) early that they cannot immediately reach, creating mystery and long-term goals
- Significant challenge designing the ice wall breaking mechanic, cycling through multiple concepts (chandelier swinging, cannons, snowball rolling) before settling on solutions
- Focus on creating multiple interconnected paths through levels rather than linear progression, allowing player choice in navigation
- Dramatic boss encounter design featuring environmental storytelling and cinematic presentation (raven boss with moon eclipse intro sequence)
- Balancing visual spectacle with gameplay functionality, particularly in implementing complex mechanics like swinging chandeliers

## Business Aspects
- No specific monetization strategy discussed, appears to be passion project/portfolio piece
- ROM hack positioned as marketing vehicle for future original game development
- Recognition that "marketing seems to be basically like 90% of the equations as making a game"
- No mention of funding sources, release timelines, or distribution plans - development appears self-funded and community-driven

## Key Quotes
- "So the guide today, we are trying to design the level today Meaning we use all the platforming mechanics we need And we place them over the level to hopefully have the game be fun"
- "i want that when you enter this area here the first thing you see like within the first five seconds of playing the level is you see a star but you have no idea how to get there and it's it's supposed to like stick in your minds"
- "God, why is this so difficult? I don't want to leave this for later. What if there is no solution?" (demonstrates the real-time problem-solving challenges in game design)

## Potential Interview Topics
- The role of live streaming and community feedback in the iterative design process
- Technical challenges and creative solutions when working within the constraints of Mario 64's engine
- The balance between honoring the original Yoshi's Island aesthetic while creating something new and personal
- Collaboration dynamics with remote team members and how feedback is incorporated into development decisions
- The transition strategy from ROM hack development to original game creation and how this project serves as both portfolio and marketing tool
