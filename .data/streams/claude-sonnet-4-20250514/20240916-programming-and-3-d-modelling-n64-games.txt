## Game Development Process
- Currently working on course 14, which features a cardboard/craft theme as part of the overall "Return to Yoshi's Island" project
- Planning to release a demo soon that will include only course one, with a "somewhat public" release
- Ongoing performance optimization work, with Kaze mentioning he "saved 30 instructions on graph render today" and found additional optimizations
- The game is designed to be "a lot harder than vanilla Mario 64" while maintaining accessibility
- Project is built on the Mario 64 decompilation, allowing for enhanced graphics and features

## Personal Insights
- Kaze emphasizes the importance of visual authenticity: "we need to get the look right because if it looks off just a little bit it's going to be very obvious that it's wrong"
- He's concerned about balancing difficulty and accessibility: "There will be tricky jumps you guys are always underestimating how difficult the game is Because you're watching me and I'm so good at this game"
- Shows attention to detail in design choices, spending significant time on materials and textures to achieve the right craft aesthetic
- Expresses frustration with technical limitations but demonstrates problem-solving persistence
- Values community interaction through streaming and takes viewer suggestions seriously

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: No relevant information found in this transcript
- Biobak: No relevant information found in this transcript  
- Zeina: No relevant information found in this transcript
- Other Contributors: SimpleFlips appears to be a significant collaborator/supporter who has provided approximately $3,500 in funding, though there are administrative challenges with formal invoicing due to missing contact information

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Implementing a cohesive craft/cardboard aesthetic across the level while maintaining gameplay functionality
- Managing N64 performance constraints, particularly polygon budget and overdraw issues (currently at 50 FPS with 18ms RSP usage)
- Designing non-linear level paths to avoid the initial problem where "from here you always go forward"
- Creating realistic-looking craft materials (toilet paper rolls, staples, cardboard textures) within technical limitations
- Balancing difficulty to challenge experienced players while remaining accessible to newcomers

## Business Aspects
- Kaze operates as a self-employed contractor and still takes commissions "if they're fine paying a hefty price for it"
- Payment processing challenges with collaborators due to missing formal business information
- Considering creating basic educational YouTube content as "really good easy content to produce"
- Plans for public demo release as part of marketing/community engagement strategy

## Key Quotes
- "we need to get the look right because if it looks off just a little bit it's going to be very obvious that it's wrong you know what i mean" - on the importance of visual authenticity
- "There will be tricky jumps you guys are always underestimating how difficult the game is Because you're watching me and I'm so good at this game" - on difficulty balancing
- "I Sent me like around $3,500 at this point, but I can't write an invoice to him because he didn't give me like his address" - regarding payment challenges with SimpleFlips

## Potential Interview Topics
- The evolution of the craft/cardboard aesthetic and how it emerged as a design choice for this particular level
- Technical challenges of developing for N64 hardware limitations while pushing visual boundaries
- The collaborative relationship with SimpleFlips and how community support has influenced development
- The iterative level design process and how streaming/community feedback shapes design decisions
- Long-term vision for the project and plans for full release beyond the initial demo
