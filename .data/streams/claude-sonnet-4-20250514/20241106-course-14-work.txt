- Multiple courses have been reworked (courses 1, 3, 4, 5, and 11 confirmed), showing an iterative development approach focused on quality improvement
- Currently working on retro sections, specifically a Mario Paint-themed section for Course 14
- Three additional side levels and three overall parts remain after main courses are completed
