## Game Development Process
- Active development of a space-themed level featuring a farming/plantation area with crops and water tanks, showing detailed attention to platforming mechanics and visual design
- Performance testing on real N64 hardware revealing optimization challenges: "43 FPS. Ooh, it doesn't like all these plants here"
- Plans for open source release: "I'm planning to open source this game anyway, so there's little point in leaking it"
- Ongoing technical challenges with PLJ (Parallel Long Jump) implementation causing crashes that need debugging
- Use of Fast64 development tools and custom background/skybox rendering techniques for memory optimization

## Personal Insights
- Strong philosophy about ROM hacks as legitimate standalone games: "I feel like right now, people don't respect RomEx as like real games. Even RomEx don't seem to do that. So I definitely want to change that. I want to make sure that this RomEx is also like playable as like a normal game without the context of Mario 64"
- Frustration with other ROM hackers' limited vision: "When I was talking to RomEx yesterday, they seemed to think that the concept of like a RomEx standing on its own legs is like completely frivolous and impossible. Which, dang, that's depressing if you are living your life like that"
- Ambitious stream funding concept for transparent development: "I had an insane stream idea concept... we plan a 30 day stream, 12 hours a day... And the goal in the stream is to make a full major Mario 64 hack. And like for every $1,000 of every $500 donated, we add an extra day of stream"

## Collaborator Information
- Dariel: Sound designer/composer working on "the compact" - requested a sound clip of Kaze sneezing for audio work
- Unnamed texture artist: Someone who DM'd Kaze wanting to replace existing textures with their own work, though Kaze noted current results were "worse than what we had before"
- Banjo-Kazooie Mario64 collaborator: Kaze mentions having meetings with someone he's "making Banjo-Kazooie with Mario64 with"

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Platform visibility and player guidance: "Platforms need more clear borders. You're absolutely right in saying that" - implementing glowing outlines to help players see platform edges
- Accessibility vs. advanced techniques: "There's a lot of people that just can't do diagonal wall jumps, so I don't want that to ever be a required tech" - deliberately avoiding requiring advanced movement techniques
- Jump difficulty balancing: "I don't want the player to do a jank jump like this" - careful attention to making platforming feel natural rather than requiring awkward movements
- Technical debugging of PLJ mechanics: "No, it's not the triangles. It's clearly something in the PLJ code itself causing an infinite loop somewhere"
- Performance optimization for N64 hardware limitations while maintaining visual quality

## Business Aspects
- History of Nintendo takedowns: "Nintendo removed a bunch of my Romics before. But missing link was definitely too good. They had to kill it or they would have looked back fools"
- Stream-based development funding model concept with donation milestones extending development time
- Open source distribution plans rather than commercial release
- No traditional marketing or commercial distribution strategies mentioned

## Key Quotes
- "I want to make sure that this RomEx is also like playable as like a normal game without the context of Mario 64"
- "When I was talking to RomEx yesterday, they seemed to think that the concept of like a RomEx standing on its own legs is like completely frivolous and impossible. Which, dang, that's depressing if you are living your life like that"
- "I'm planning to open source this game anyway, so there's little point in leaking it. All you're really doing by leaking it is to make it so a bunch of people play a worse version of the game hasn't yet finished"
