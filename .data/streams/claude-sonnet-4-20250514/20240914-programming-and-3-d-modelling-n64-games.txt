## Game Development Process
- Course 13 is mostly complete, with Xena finishing remaining exterior work
- Currently in asset creation phase for Course 14 (craft-themed level), focusing on creating materials like crayons, plastic cups, and cardboard elements
- Course 15 has all platforms completed and ready for import/level creation
- Demo planned for release within the next two months, featuring just the first course
- Ongoing technical optimizations including recent F3DX3 import and polygon reduction efforts
- Estimated 6-7 months remaining for full project completion, including Bowser level and side levels
- ROM size limit established at 64MB with multiple version release strategy planned

## Personal Insights
- Evolved design philosophy since Last Impact: "when i made last impact really my thought was never can i make this fun it was always just i have an idea i'll put it in like i didn't even double think double check if it was a good idea"
- Current approach prioritizes player experience over pure technical showcase
- Strong opinions on advertising and sponsorships: "Generally, I never take sponsorships unless I can think of a way to like fuck them over. Just in general, I think ads are like not a good thing for anyone"
- Views YouTube content creation as best path for financial success and PR for future game development
- Advice for aspiring game developers: "make as many games as possible as fast as possible. So you learn because your first 100 games or so are just going to suck ass"

## Collaborator Information
- Xena/Zeina: Animator working on Course 13 exterior areas, has tested physics systems and provided feedback on player movement intuitiveness, also creates concept sketches for overworld design
- Biobak/Biomech: Graphics artist responsible for major optimizations (recently removed 400 polygons from main area while maintaining visual quality), currently working on Course 13, given flexible schedule ("day off")
- Soren: Technical contributor working on RSP (Reality Signal Processor) optimization for improved performance
- Other Contributors: Unnamed video editor who edited Kaze's recent successful YouTube video about grass in Mario 64

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Course 14 themed around craft materials with specific gameplay mechanics: crayon-drawing star collection, NPC quest systems with "robotic" characters
- Technical challenge balancing visual quality with N64 performance constraints (targeting 30+ FPS)
- Creative challenge designing believable craft-material assets while maintaining platforming functionality
- Star collection variety: crayon drawing mechanics, simple fetch quests, hidden platforming sections, red coin collection
- Strategic decision to make levels feel like something "someone who crafted something would make" rather than child-like creations

## Business Aspects
- Recent YouTube video performing exceptionally well, driving strategic focus on content creation
- Potential Raid Shadow Legends sponsorship being negotiated via AI assistance
- Three-tier release strategy: Version 1 (emulator + N64), Version 1.1 (emulator + N64), Version 1.2 (N64 only)
- Post-completion plans include YouTube content creation and original game development
- Recognition that YouTube success provides best financial opportunity and marketing for future projects

## Key Quotes
- "I want at least 30 FPS. We're in the 50s. No, we're still in the 30s... I can very easily increase the FPS by just reducing the amount of clouds."
- "My advice to get people getting into game development is always make as many games as possible as fast as possible as you learn because your first 100 games or so are just going to suck ass."
- "When I made Last Impact really my thought was never can I make this fun it was always just I have an idea I'll put it in... without even double checking anything just because I didn't want to be lazy."
