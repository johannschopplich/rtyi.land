## Game Development Process
- The project is nearing completion with 14 of 15 main courses developed, featuring a planned total of 135 main stars and 45 special "Yoshi stars" with unique restrictions
- Course 1 recently received a major rework by collaborator Biobak, achieving significant optimization (220 fewer triangles, 7 fewer materials) while improving visual quality
- A demo release is planned for Patreon supporters in the near future, with Kaze preparing promotional materials and screenshots
- The game will feature an interconnected overworld representing the entirety of Yoshi's Island, allowing 360-degree exploration that deepens as players collect more stars

## Personal Insights
- Kaze views his ROM hacking work as having professional value, noting his current employer hired him partly because of these skills: "Yeah, they actually hired me because of this. And I think most of the people I work with think it's cool"
- He relocated from Germany to Canada in 2021 and expresses strong satisfaction with the move: "i'm so glad i don't live in germany anymore oh god all the bureaucracy bullshit in germany has ruined my quality of life"
- Shows pragmatic approach to content creation, planning Mario 64 educational videos as a way to reach broader audiences: "I think that's the kind of slop that YouTube viewers love and I think we can get famous that way"
- Demonstrates perfectionist tendencies, willing to extensively debug technical issues and iterate on design elements until they meet his standards

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub (Composer)**: Created original music for the current level, though Kaze felt it didn't match the intended adventure vibe: "But for me It doesn't fit the vibe Feels more like A beach at sunset Not like a complete adventure, you know And I'm also kinda missing the The melody that you can hum along to"
- **Biobak/Biomech (Graphics Artist)**: Delivered a comprehensive Course 1 rework with major performance improvements, demonstrating strong technical optimization skills while enhancing visual appeal
- **Zeina (Animator)**: Mentioned as a collaborator and Minecraft gaming partner, though specific contributions to the project weren't detailed in this stream
- **Other Contributors**: Active community involvement through chat feedback on enemy design, level naming, and gameplay mechanics

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Enemy behavior programming focuses on creating unique mechanics that fit the handcrafted aesthetic, such as thimble-based "shy guys" that chase Mario and can be knocked back like bullies rather than squished
- Technical rendering challenges with shader effects and texture scrolling on N64 hardware, requiring creative problem-solving and debugging
- Balancing authentic Yoshi's Island enemy designs (like "Bert the Bashful") with the constraints of Mario 64's engine and the handcrafted visual theme
- Performance optimization remains a constant consideration, with careful polygon management and texture format decisions to maintain smooth gameplay on original hardware

## Business Aspects
- Plans for physical OST cartridge release as potential merchandise: "I was actually thinking of just releasing R.T.Y.I. Together with an OST cartridge [...] But releasing it on a cartridge That would be the coolest thing ever"
- Legal consultation planned before release: "But I will probably talk to a lawyer Before I release R.T.Y.I."
- Patreon supporter system in place for early access to demos and development updates
- Strategic approach to content creation with educational Mario 64 videos to build audience and visibility for the main project

## Key Quotes
- "I have decided find a video schedule. We are going to make a video explaining BLJ first and then I'm gonna make a video where basically I re-release the missing link for some updates to the game to make the game better and to like get a video of it back online after Nintendo took it down"
- "It is super important that the overworld is the entirety of Yoshi's Island. It is important that you get like a 360° round view of the beach next to Yoshi's Island. So it feels like you can actually explore the entire island"
- "The OST for this is completely 100% original"

## Potential Interview Topics
- The transition from hobby ROM hacking to professional game development opportunities and how the skillsets translate
- The collaborative process with team members, particularly the feedback and iteration cycles with artists and composers
- Technical challenges of developing for N64 hardware constraints while maintaining modern design standards
- The decision-making process behind staying true to Yoshi's Island aesthetics while adapting to Mario 64's engine capabilities
- Plans for legal protection and potential commercialization of the project, including the innovative OST cartridge concept
