## Game Development Process
- Currently working on Course 15, described as "the last course" in Return to Yoshi's Island
- Implementing a Mario Paint-inspired level featuring a dynamic drawing/coloring system where players can paint Mario
- The drawing system uses dynamically allocated texture memory and flood-fill algorithms optimized for N64 constraints
- Developing a scoring system that evaluates player drawings and awards stars based on accuracy thresholds
- The level runs at 60 FPS despite the complex drawing mechanics and high-poly 3D models

## Personal Insights
- Kaze expresses concern about the current political climate affecting his ability to create certain content: "if I do the same thing in 2024 with the Trump 64 ROM hack, people will murder me"
- He has clear preferences in game design, stating he doesn't like 2D platformers except Yoshi's Island, and prefers exploration over dungeons in Zelda games
- He's planning a transition to indie game development: "I'm planning to make indie games eventually, there is this idea of maybe asset swapping Return to Yoshi's Island when it's done and releasing it under my own IP"
- He shows technical pride in optimizing for N64 constraints, mentioning the console's "hidden memory" and efficient CPU usage

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: No specific information found in this transcript
- Biobak: No specific information found in this transcript  
- Zeina: Mentioned as someone he's currently playing Twilight Princess with, and referenced as working on animations for the project
- Other Contributors: Falco is mentioned in relation to emulator development and compatibility issues with Parallel RDP

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Implementing a forgiving scoring system where players can make significant mistakes but still succeed: "You can be this wrong and still win"
- Technical challenge of creating dynamic texture rendering within N64 memory constraints
- Balancing visual fidelity with performance, using high-poly models (300 triangles for the robot character) in small areas
- Dealing with emulator compatibility issues, specifically crashes in Parallel RDP that couldn't be resolved
- Design decision to not include undo functionality: "It's still a game, guys. This is not an image editor. You fuck up, you lose your points"

## Business Aspects
- Secured sponsorship deal with Roblox for streaming content
- Considering asset-swapping strategy to convert ROM hack into original IP for indie game release
- Working on an undisclosed project under NDA: "The game I'm working on is still not finished. And I'm under NDA. So I can't tell you"
- Aware of potential legal issues with Nintendo assets and the need to consult lawyers about commercial use

## Key Quotes
- "The Nintendo 64 has around one megabyte of hidden memory that you don't really use. But there's ways to use it. And I'm thinking of making a video about how to use the hidden memory that no one knew about."
- "I'm planning to make indie games eventually, there is this idea of maybe asset swapping Return to Yoshi's Island when it's done and releasing it under my own IP, because the only vanilla actor I use in this game is Mario himself"
- "It's still a game, guys. This is not an image editor. You fuck up, you lose your points. That's what it's going to be."

## Potential Interview Topics
