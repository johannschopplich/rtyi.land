## Game Development Process
- Currently working on course 14, which is "already like half way done" with "two more stages" remaining after the current section
- Actively developing a shooting minigame section with bird enemies and bullet mechanics, showing iterative design process
- Managing technical constraints with triangle count concerns: "This already has 19,000 triangles and it's like barely finished. We still need the outside here"
- Planning to release a demo "at some point in the near future" that will feature "just the first course"
- Working on various technical aspects including enemy animations, collision detection, sound effects, and camera systems

## Personal Insights
- Expresses fatigue and social exhaustion: "I feel so exhausted today" and "I can't be around people for too long, no matter who it is"
- Shows strong concern about accessibility barriers: "every step along the way like opening project 64 setting to 8 megabytes clicking the rom patching the rom you lose some percentage of your player base"
- Acknowledges Nintendo legal risks pragmatically: "yes of course there is a worry that nintendo is just going to say now fuck you your game is over but you just have to live with that it's all you can do"
- Values community input while maintaining creative control over design decisions
- Demonstrates commitment to open development: "i'll definitely publish everything including assets"

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Core design philosophy of translating 2D source material to 3D: "We have to somewhat translate it into 3D, I don't want it to just be a 2D section"
- Major camera angle challenge for shooting mechanics: "So many people have suggested the camera angle change, but then like, how do you even aim?"
- Technical optimization challenges balancing visual quality with N64 hardware limitations
- Iterative enemy design process, incorporating community feedback on bird enemy sprites and animations
- Sound design decisions for shooting mechanics, testing multiple audio options for cannon fire effects
- Performance optimization considerations regarding microcode and rendering techniques

## Business Aspects
- Strong focus on minimizing distribution barriers and setup complexity for end users
- Concerns about emulation plugin compatibility and RT64 availability for optimal user experience
- Plans to release all development assets including blend files for community use
- Awareness of Nintendo's history with fan projects while continuing development
- No mention of funding, monetization, or formal marketing strategies

## Key Quotes
- "every step along the way like opening project 64 setting to 8 megabytes clicking the rom patching the rom you lose some percentage of your player base and the more unusual your setup is the higher the percentage will be so it is something i'm very worried of"
- "yes of course there is a worry that nintendo is just going to say now fuck you your game is over but you just have to live with that it's all you can do"
- "We have to somewhat translate it into 3D, I don't want it to just be a 2D section"
