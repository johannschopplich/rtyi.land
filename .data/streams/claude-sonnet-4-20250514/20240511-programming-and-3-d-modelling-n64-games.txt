## Game Development Process
- Currently in active level design phase for ice castle level, transitioning from conceptual planning to 3D modeling implementation
- Developed custom OS for N64 to optimize performance and provide better control over the system
- Working iteratively on art style development with collaborators, testing different approaches for texture effects and visual aesthetics
- Planning 6-star level structure with interconnected rooms and multiple pathways through the castle
- Next development milestone involves moving from "weird concepting to actual level real fast" with significant progress expected

## Personal Insights
- Kaze demonstrates strong technical perfectionism, spending considerable time refining visual effects and texture work
- Shows commitment to balancing challenge with accessibility: "So it's going to feel confusing, but not frustrating is the goal here"
- Emphasizes inspiration from classic Mario 64 levels, specifically wanting the ice castle to evoke the atmosphere of "Tick Tock Clock"
- Expresses frustration with technical limitations but maintains problem-solving approach to overcome constraints
- Strong advocate for open source development despite misconceptions from the community

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: No relevant information found in this transcript
- Biobank: Graphics artist actively collaborating on art style development, working "very actively" off-stream to develop texture effects and visual concepts for the ice castle level
- Zeina: Animator working on enemy designs, specifically mentioned creating the raven enemy model that "looks really good"
- Other Contributors: No additional major contributors mentioned beyond brief interactions with stream viewers

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Creating atmospheric ice castle with "eerie" and "lonely" vibe featuring challenging late-game platforming
- Technical challenge of implementing reflective ice textures within N64 hardware limitations, requiring CPU-generated normal maps as workaround
- Designing interconnected castle layout with U-shaped structure, towers, bridges, and basement areas to avoid confusing but frustrating navigation
- Implementing damage-over-time mechanics in cold areas with fire safe spots as strategic gameplay element
- Texture quantization issues causing visual degradation when converting from development tools to N64 format

## Business Aspects
- Plans to release source code publicly, addressing community misconceptions about open source availability
- Considering ambitious dual release strategy for both N64 and PC platforms simultaneously for marketing impact
- No specific funding sources or monetization strategies discussed

## Key Quotes
- "Did I tell you guys that I wrote a new OS for my N64? It's all done now, it's all good. I'm still gonna optimize parts of it, but it's already quite a bit better."
- "So it's going to feel confusing, but not frustrating is the goal here."
- "So next stream we will be making significant progress in this this will go from weird concepting to actual level real fast"

## Potential Interview Topics
- The technical innovation behind developing a custom N64 OS and its impact on the project's capabilities
