## Game Development Process
- Currently in active NPC animation phase, working on characters like dry bones, piano player, and cow Boshy
- Developing course 14 with sub-areas, including a collaboration level with contributor Aza
- Weekly development streams on Saturdays showing progress to community
- Working on both gameplay mechanics and visual elements simultaneously
- Creating retro-themed stages that reference classic Mario games like Mario Kart 64
- Extensive dialogue system planned with approximately 500 dialogue boxes (3x more than vanilla Mario 64)

## Personal Insights
- Views game development as experimentation and learning: "it's always been experimentation for me... I want to make something I always make it with the idea like I'm gonna learn from this and become even better"
- Willing to pursue creative concepts even if they may not be popular: "making the bathroom level obviously I knew like most people aren't gonna like this but I still wanted to see what I could do with the concept"
- Emphasizes level design improvement through iteration: "I'm gonna make 32 linear levels to make sure that I'm good at making linear levels right"
- Motivated by intrinsic rather than extrinsic factors in game design
- Sees each project as a stepping stone to becoming a better developer

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: No relevant information found in this transcript
- Biobak: Mentioned as possibly involved in marketing or graphics, but role unclear from transcript
- Zeina: Active animator creating character animations including dry bones, piano player, and cow Boshy characters. Kaze praises their work: "Zayna, the Dry Bones look really, really good in-game. You will love them"
- Other Contributors: Aza (level designer working on collaboration levels), various community members providing feedback during streams

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Performance optimization is a major focus: "what causes the game to have so many performance issues yeah it's just program pooling it is what it is"
- Working within N64 hardware limitations while maximizing efficiency: "I don't think there has been a game on the n64 that uses cash as well as this one"
- Balancing creative ambition with technical constraints and development time
- Decision to include extensive dialogue system despite complexity
- Creating authentic cowboy/western themed content with appropriate character interactions and dueling mechanics
- Implementing line-of-sight AI systems for enemy NPCs

## Business Aspects
- Financial considerations influence project scope decisions: "Not financially worth it unless someone pays me to work on that" (regarding potential Wind Waker project)
- Uncertain about localization due to extensive text: "Will there be a German version? I don't know There's so much text on this game"
- No clear monetization strategy discussed in this transcript

## Key Quotes
- "it's always been experimentation for me... I want to make something I always make it with the idea like I'm gonna learn from this and become even better"
- "I don't think there has been a game on the n64 that uses cash as well as this one"
- "making the bathroom level obviously I knew like most people aren't gonna like this but I still wanted to see what I could do with the concept"
