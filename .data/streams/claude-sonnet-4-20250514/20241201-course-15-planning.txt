## Game Development Process
- Currently working on the "Astral Arcade" level, described as "an arcade in space" with pinball mechanics
- The level follows a "mario galaxy type design philosophy basically Feel open but be linear which we do by like having a bunch of random linear paths that somewhat intersect"
- Development appears to be in advanced stages as Kaze states "All the other courses are finished now"
- Current focus is on 3D modeling and programming flipper mechanics for the space pinball level
- Using development tools including Fast64 and Blender for asset creation
- The level design involves a main area with flipper pieces floating below it, where players can collect coins and be shot back up to the main area

## Personal Insights
- Kaze expresses growing frustration with community feedback: "I don't know what it is, but recently I've been getting so much more annoyed at like my YouTube comments and stuff"
- Shows confidence in his abilities despite challenges: "I know what I'm doing, have some confidence in me"
- Demonstrates technical perfectionism, spending significant time on visual details that may seem minor
- Has upcoming video projects related to N64 optimization: "I actually have two insane video ideas coming up soon...there's like an entire megabyte of n64 memory that we can use"
- Expresses passion for technical optimization and programming as high-skill activities

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: No relevant information found in this transcript
- Biobak: Referenced as someone who will "improve this anyway," suggesting they work on polishing and improving 3D models created by Kaze
- Zeina: No relevant information found in this transcript
- Other Contributors: Wise Guy mentioned as providing textures ("I have these textures wise guy sent them to me"), indicating community members contribute assets to the project

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Major design challenge translating 2D pinball mechanics to 3D space: "we have to keep in mind that the ones we make have to work in 3D space, so we can't do all of this"
- Struggle with creating convincing bumper ball visuals: "how do we make a sphere that looks like it pushes you away when you jump into it is it even possible"
- Decision to use disconnected floating flipper pieces rather than a traditional pinball machine layout
- Challenge balancing visual appeal with functional game mechanics
- Innovation in applying pinball mechanics to a 3D Mario-style platformer environment

## Business Aspects
- Legal concerns prevent traditional distribution methods: "I can't give people access because like if I did it via patreon or something I would basically be selling access to the game which would be really bad legally speaking"
- Aware of copyright restrictions due to ROM hack nature of the project
- Mentions various YouTube monetization strategies but no direct monetization plans for the game itself
- Beta testing access is highly restricted due to legal concerns

## Key Quotes
- "All the other courses are finished now" - indicating the project is in final stages
- "mario galaxy type design philosophy basically Feel open but be linear" - describing the core design approach
- "I can't give people access because like if I did it via patreon or something I would basically be selling access to the game which would be really bad legally speaking" - highlighting the legal constraints of ROM hack development

## Potential Interview Topics
- The challenge of adapting 2D game mechanics (pinball) to 3D space and how this reflects broader innovation in ROM hack development
- The legal and distribution challenges facing ROM hack developers and how this affects creative decisions
- The collaborative process between Kaze and other contributors like Biobak, and how community feedback influences development
- The technical innovation involved in pushing N64 hardware limitations, particularly the memory optimization techniques mentioned
- The evolution from earlier Mario 64 ROM hacks to this more ambitious project and what drives continued innovation in this space
