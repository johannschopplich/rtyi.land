## Game Development Process
- The project appears to be in active development with level design being a primary focus during this stream
- Kaze mentions they're working on a craft-themed level that's "really fast to do because it's made out of simple craft materials"
- The development follows an iterative approach with multiple star objectives per level, including crayon escort missions, paper plane rides, and red coin collection sections
- Technical implementation is ongoing, with custom solutions being developed for N64 limitations
- The team is approaching completion of the platforming elements: "we basically have all the platforming done and we can start programming it"

## Personal Insights
- Kaze demonstrates deep self-awareness about his development process, particularly his texture-focused approach: "How come almost every stream I do just devolves into looking for textures? Is this just how I'm built?"
- He shows a preference for learning through documentation rather than tutorials: "I just started on page 1 of the Blender documentation... I do not like the donut tutorial. I'm the number 1 donut tutorial hater"
- There's consideration for educational content creation: "Do you guys think I should make a video about advanced lighting effects?"
- Kaze appears to be the primary creative force while acknowledging collaborative elements

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: Identified as the primary music composer ("but it was making most of the music")
- Biobak: Contributing to level rework and refinement ("biobank is helping me rework some of my levels")
- Zeina: Referenced multiple times with apparent close working relationship, involved in animations
- Other Contributors: Community members contribute assets like character doodles, with Kaze maintaining quality control ("It's up to your standards")

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Core aesthetic challenge: Creating a cohesive craft materials theme using styrofoam, cardboard, paper, and other craft supplies
- Technical innovation: Custom implementation of normal mapping on N64 hardware ("The N64 does not have normal map support. I added the support")
- Enemy design philosophy: Adapting Mario 64 enemies to fit craft aesthetic (cardboard womps, scissors, saw blades)
- Performance constraints: Balancing visual fidelity with N64 limitations, particularly regarding polygon count and texture resolution
- Level design approach: Multiple interconnected sections with distinct mechanics and visual themes within the craft world concept

## Business Aspects
- Limited monetization currently through stream donations and Patreon support
- No specific release timeline or distribution strategy discussed
- Community engagement appears to be primary marketing approach through streaming
- No mention of commercial partnerships or funding sources beyond community support

## Key Quotes
- "How come almost every stream I do just devolves into looking for textures? Is this just how I'm built? Do I just look for textures all the time? Am I doomed to roam this earth just looking for textures all my life?"
- "The N64 does not have normal map support. I added the support. The texture is computed on the CPU. And then the GPU just has surrendered."
- "This course was really fast to do because it's made out of simple craft materials. So really all I need to do is really just to shade us and stuff"

## Potential Interview Topics
- The technical innovation behind implementing modern graphics techniques on N64 hardware and the challenges overcome
- The creative vision behind the craft aesthetic and how it influences both visual design and gameplay mechanics
- The collaborative process with team members and how responsibilities are divided across the project
- The relationship with the streaming community and how audience feedback influences development decisions
- The evolution from Mario 64 ROM hacking to creating more ambitious original content within the engine
