## Game Development Process
- Currently working on "Return to Yoshi's Island," a ROM hack based on Mario 64 decompilation, with multiple courses and complex level designs
- Planning to release a focused demo of just course one to gather feedback on physics and camera systems before continuing with full development
- Using iterative development approach with community playtesting: "The idea would be that I get a lot of playtest data to tweak all the little variables so that everything's perfect"
- Development timeline spans several years, with Kaze noting that Nintendo has been working on their next Mario game "three years longer than me" since Mario Odyssey (2017)
- Currently focusing on technical improvements including collision mapping, lighting systems, texture optimization, and visual enhancements

## Personal Insights
- Maintains strong creative control over the project: "I genuinely believe me making every single decision ever is better than democracy for everyone involved, especially me"
- Self-aware about his limitations in visual arts: "I have zero talent for visuals... I can't just wipe it out it doesn't work for me... which is why I will never be like an amazing 3d artist I will always just be at the best averaged or like slightly above average"
- Approaches visual design through "rational thinking and computation" rather than artistic intuition
- Passionate about game feel and mechanics: "Dude, the movement in this game feels so good to me now. It's so fun to just move around"
- Values direct feedback and iteration over theoretical design principles

## Collaborator Information
- Biobak: Graphics artist who completed a major visual rework of the "Oily Boily Bay" level that impressed Kaze significantly ("Dude this is actually an insane effect... This actually looks insane")
- Badub: Composer who has created bonus tracks for the game that Kaze hadn't previously showcased publicly
- Zeina: Animator mentioned in the context of character animations and movement systems
- Other Contributors: Lila provides technical assistance with tools and troubleshooting; active community members provide ongoing feedback through live streams

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Implementing enhanced Mario mechanics including context-sensitive jumping: "you can jump on Goombas normally, right? But if you hold the A button... You jump higher. And you regain some control of Mario"
- Balancing technical limitations (triangle counts, rendering optimization) with visual ambitions
- Developing sophisticated lighting and visual effects systems within N64 hardware constraints
- Creating seamless level transitions and camera systems for complex 3D environments
- Focusing on game feel improvements: removing input delay frames and making controls more responsive

## Business Aspects
- Plans for structured demo releases to build community engagement and gather feedback
- Future aspirations mentioned: "one day after rty we will absolutely just turn this into like a proper game company and we will make so much money"
- Currently operating as passion project with volunteer contributors
- No specific funding, marketing strategies, or commercial distribution plans discussed in detail

## Key Quotes
- "I genuinely believe me making every single decision ever is better than democracy for everyone involved, especially me" - Reveals his approach to creative control
- "The idea would be that I get a lot of playtest data to tweak all the little variables so that everything's perfect" - Shows commitment to iterative, feedback-driven development
- "I have zero talent for visuals... I will always just be at the best averaged or like slightly above average it is what it is" - Demonstrates self-awareness and humility about his limitations while showing determination to continue

## Potential Interview Topics
- The decision-making process behind using Mario 64 decompilation versus creating an original engine, and how this choice has shaped the development process
- Balancing creative control with collaborative input from talented contributors like Biobak, and how he manages the tension between his vision and others' expertise
- The technical and creative challenges of working within N64 hardware limitations while trying to achieve modern visual standards
- His philosophy on game design democracy versus auteur control, and how this impacts team dynamics and creative decisions
- Long-term vision for the project: whether it's intended as a fan tribute, a stepping stone to commercial game development, or something else entirely
