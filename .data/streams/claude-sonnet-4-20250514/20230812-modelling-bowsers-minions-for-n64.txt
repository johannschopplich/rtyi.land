## Game Development Process
- Currently implementing new mechanics like a "soul bar" that players can ride like Koopa shells, showing iterative gameplay development
- Redesigning the star select screen with small panoramas for each level to show the "vibe" of each area
- Working on advanced particle effects including soap bubbles and oil slick mechanics with dynamic cleanup features
- ROM space optimization is a critical constraint, with Kaze noting that removing original Mario Kart 64 backgrounds saved 0.3 MB of space
- Using Fast64 extension for Blender to export assets into Mario 64 format, indicating modern tools being applied to retro development
- Development appears to be in active iteration phase with frequent testing and refinement of mechanics

## Personal Insights
- Kaze prioritizes visual flair and polish, stating "Adding visual flare is important to the game. You can't just not add visual flare to the game"
- Shows resistance to updating older projects: "I don't like going back and updating shit"
- Has strong opinions about maintaining standalone game experiences rather than creating connected narratives across fan games
- Demonstrates concern for technical optimization while balancing creative vision
- Values community input but maintains creative control over final decisions
- Shows frustration with certain development tools, particularly software that requires frequent updates

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: No relevant information found in this transcript
- Biobak: Graphics artist who contributed significant ideas for the star select screen redesign, with Kaze noting "Biobank had some pretty cool ideas" and praising their panorama concepts as working "a lot better"
- Zeina: Animator mentioned as being "at work" during the stream, with Kaze jokingly saying he's "being held hostage" - suggests close working relationship
- Other Contributors: Anonymous Moose (contributed similar ideas to the soul bar concept), Arthur (community member providing feedback), various community members offering suggestions and ideas during development

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- ROM space limitations are a major constraint affecting all design decisions, with texture compression and format choices being critical considerations
- Balancing visual quality with technical performance, particularly for particle effects and texture resolution
- Creating custom particle systems to improve performance over original Mario 64 systems
- Implementing dynamic texture systems for interactive elements like the oil slick cleanup mechanic
- Maintaining the Mario 64 feel while introducing new mechanics and visual effects
- Technical challenges include vertex color manipulation, alpha blending, and texture optimization

## Business Aspects
- Mentions F3 community event with approximately 100 prize submissions, suggesting involvement in ROM hacking community events
- Has donation links set up for development streams
- No specific commercial release plans mentioned - appears to be community-driven development
- Development seems funded through community support and personal investment

## Key Quotes
- "So this is the new idea for the star select. Basically, each level is gonna have a very small panorama that shows the vibe of the level." - Shows attention to user experience design
- "See, I removed the original mk64 backgrounds. And it saved around 0.3 MB of ROM space. Just for the grass." - Highlights the technical constraints driving development decisions
- "Adding visual flare is important to the game. You can't just not add visual flare to the game. Your game would just look like a shadow of a game and not a real game." - Reveals his philosophy on game polish and presentation

## Potential Interview Topics
- How ROM space limitations influence creative decisions and what compromises have to be made between vision and technical constraints
- The collaborative process with Biobak and Zeina, and how their contributions shape the final product
- The evolution of the project from initial concept to current state, including major pivots or changes in direction
- The role of community feedback in development and how Kaze balances community input with personal creative vision
- The technical challenges of working with Mario 64 decompilation and how it differs from traditional game development
