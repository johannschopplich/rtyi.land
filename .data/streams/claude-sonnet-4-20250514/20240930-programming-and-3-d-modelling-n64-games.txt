## Game Development Process
- Game is in advanced development stages with 15 courses planned total, currently working on course 14 with course 15 (Halloween-themed) already halfway completed
- Major focus on iterative improvement and polish, with Course 1 receiving its second major rework from collaborator Biobank
- Designed specifically to run on actual Nintendo 64 hardware, emphasizing technical optimization and polygon limits
- Development follows a sandbox-style approach inspired by Mario 64 but with significantly more content density per "star"
- Stream shows active development work including enemy design (Thwomp with paper/cardboard aesthetic) and level optimization

## Personal Insights
- Kaze demonstrates perfectionist tendencies, stating "i would never just be like yep we found the perfect thing" when discussing naming conventions and design choices
- Shows frustration with community pressure for release timelines, responding to Christmas release requests with "Please shut the fuck up. Leave me be"
- Reveals concern about narrative appropriateness, reconsidering the game's original plot due to slavery themes being potentially too dark for a Mario game
- Values player agency and skill expression: "Basically, nothing in this game is mandatory if you're good at the game. And that's the beauty"
- Balances community feedback with personal vision while maintaining quality standards

## Collaborator Information
- Biobank: Primary graphics artist responsible for major level reworks and visual improvements. Highly skilled but occasionally makes technical implementation errors that Kaze must correct. Currently working on Course 1 improvements including lighting, textures, and environmental details.
- Badub: No relevant information found in this transcript.
- Zeina: No relevant information found in this transcript.
- Other Contributors: Community members providing real-time feedback during streams, unnamed Twitter contact interested in commissioning a Mario Party 64 remake project, various chat participants offering design suggestions and testing feedback.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Artistic direction emphasizes paper/cardboard aesthetic, particularly evident in enemy design (Thwomp with googly eyes and folded paper appearance)
- Technical challenges include complex material rendering, lighting optimization, and maintaining performance on original N64 hardware
- Level design philosophy centers on optional challenges that skilled players can bypass, creating multiple difficulty tiers
- Plot revision from original Bowser-captures-Yoshis slavery narrative to something more appropriate for the Mario universe
- Ongoing tension between technical limitations and artistic vision, requiring constant optimization and rework

## Business Aspects
- Community pressure for Christmas release timeline, which Kaze resists in favor of quality
- Potential commercial opportunity mentioned regarding a commissioned Mario Party 64 remake project
- Emphasis on N64 hardware compatibility as a key selling point and technical achievement
- No specific marketing or distribution plans discussed in detail

## Key Quotes
- "We had a plot at some point, but then I realized the plot sucks, so I want to change it. First, the plot was Bowser goes to Yoshi's Island and captures all the Yoshis and makes them work for him. But a whole slavery plot is maybe a bit too much for a Mario game."
- "Basically, nothing in this game is mandatory if you're good at the game. And that's the beauty."
- "Please shut the fuck up. Leave me be. Sorry." (Response to community pressure for Christmas release)

## Potential Interview Topics

- The collaborative workflow with Biobank and how technical/artistic differences are resolved during the iterative development process
- The technical philosophy and challenges of developing for original N64 hardware in the modern era
- How community feedback and pressure influences development decisions and timeline management
- The design philosophy behind optional difficulty and player agency within the Mario 64 framework
