## Game Development Process
- Currently working on course 11 out of 15 total courses, indicating the project is in advanced stages but still has significant work remaining
- Estimates approximately two years until completion despite being "almost done" with level structure
- Planning 175-220 total stars with 130 main stars plus various bonus categories including Yoshi missions inspired by Mario Galaxy's comet system
- Has extensive content planned including Emerald Hunt-style missions inspired by Sonic Adventure and overworld stars
- Development is bottlenecked by video creation reluctance, with plans to improve YouTube output through professional editing services

## Personal Insights
- Strong philosophy of "pick your own difficulty" rather than explicit difficulty modes, allowing players to choose challenging or easy routes
- Believes in designing jumps that "feel cool to pull off" rather than making things difficult for difficulty's sake
- Concerned about dive mechanics potentially trivializing level design and making the game too easy for advanced players
- Values community feedback and iterative design, often incorporating viewer suggestions during development streams
- Balancing personal life changes (expecting first child) with development timeline and community engagement

## Collaborator Information
- Biobank: Primary graphics artist responsible for visual effects, spline lighting systems, and environmental design. Contributes creative ideas for particle effects and visual polish
- Zena: Partner and animator, handles animation work and occasionally appears on streams. Expecting their first child together, which will affect development schedule
- Dan: Technical collaborator who assisted with visual effects implementation
- Other Contributors: Community members provide ongoing feedback, someone offered professional video editing services at $16 per minute to help with YouTube content creation

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Major debate about dive mechanics: whether to nerf the ground pound dive to prevent trivializing platforming while maintaining the satisfying feel
- Technical challenges with particle systems, particularly creating convincing ice breath effects for enemy animations
- Balancing accessibility features (like infinite health mode) without compromising core gameplay philosophy
- Camera system implementation that "actually just works" - highlighting technical innovation in 3D Mario camera design
- Star progression design incorporating multiple tiers of content to extend playtime while maintaining quality

## Business Aspects
- No explicit monetization strategy discussed, but mentions concerns about Nintendo's potential reaction to the project
- YouTube content creation identified as major bottleneck for promotion and community building
- Professional video editing services being considered to improve content output and reach
- Community engagement through streaming appears to be primary marketing approach
- No specific release timeline or distribution plans mentioned

## Key Quotes
- "I want the game to not be difficult I want it to be like pick your own difficulty where you can go for risky jumps and like do the difficult thing or you can do the easy thing whenever you want"
- "Don't make things difficult to make them difficult Instead think about jumps that feel cool to pull off"
- "We're in quest 13 out of 15, so we're almost done already. Well, almost done. It's probably still going to be like two years or so, I don't know."

## Potential Interview Topics
- Philosophy behind "pick your own difficulty" design and how it differs from traditional accessibility approaches
- The technical challenges and innovations in adapting Mario 64's engine for new gameplay mechanics
- Balancing nostalgia for classic Mario design with modern game development insights and community expectations
- The role of community feedback in shaping design decisions and how streaming development has influenced the creative process
- Personal motivations behind creating such an extensive ROM hack and the relationship between personal expression and technical achievement
