## Game Development Process
- The project is actively in development with 13 levels completed out of a planned larger scope that includes boss levels, side levels, and overworld areas
- The game has been successfully optimized to run at near 60 FPS on real Nintendo 64 hardware, demonstrating significant technical achievement
- Recent work focused on refactoring the codebase, fixing crashes, and improving stability: "I Spent some time this week Refactoring some of the RTUI code base. I Got it working on n64 again Fixed a lot of crashes. The game is a lot more stable."
- Development timeline is extensive with an estimated "two to three years more or so" remaining
- The project transitioned from assembly programming to using the Mario 64 decompilation project around 2018-2019, significantly improving the development process

## Personal Insights
- Kaze views game development as an enormous undertaking: "Making this game is honestly like scaling 50 Everests. That pretty much encapsulates how I feel about making video games"
- He has strong opinions about game design philosophy, emphasizing innovation: "to me, games is about experiencing new ideas and concepts" when discussing other ROM hacks
- Kaze is receptive to design feedback and willing to reconsider core mechanics based on expert input, as shown in his discussion about potentially modifying the dive jump after feedback from Dan Salvato
- He demonstrates perfectionist tendencies, constantly working on optimization and technical improvements even for small performance gains

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub**: No specific information about the composer mentioned in this transcript
- **Biobak**: Active graphics artist who provides design suggestions and feedback during development, particularly regarding enemy placement and visual design decisions
- **Zeina**: 3D modeler and animator who creates enemy models and animations; maintains active communication with Kaze during development, sending models for implementation
- **Other Contributors**: Dan Salvato provided significant feedback on game mechanics, specifically questioning whether the dive jump feature aligns with Mario 64's design philosophy

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Currently developing ice Raven enemies with complex AI behavior including pathfinding, turning mechanics, and spawning from walls/ground
- Ongoing technical optimization work, including plans to implement frame buffer memory segmentation for additional performance gains
- Balancing innovation with staying true to Mario 64's core design principles, particularly regarding the dive jump mechanic debate
- Level design challenges around enemy placement and ensuring gameplay mechanics feel natural within the Mario 64 framework
- Iterative design process where enemies and mechanics are continuously refined based on testing and feedback

## Business Aspects
- No concrete marketing, funding, or distribution plans discussed
- Timeline is intentionally vague with Kaze stating "It's done when it's done" philosophy
- Community engagement through streaming appears to be the primary form of marketing/audience building
- No monetization strategy or commercial considerations mentioned

## Key Quotes
- "Making this game is honestly like scaling 50 Everests. That pretty much encapsulates how I feel about making video games."
- "to me, games is about experiencing new ideas and concepts. And I don't really get that from this axe [referring to other ROM hacks]"
- "So I talked to Dan Salvato and he said that the dive jump we have is kind of like against the design of Mario 64 and I can kind of see it."
