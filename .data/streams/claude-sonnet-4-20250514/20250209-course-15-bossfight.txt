## Game Development Process
- Currently working on Course 15 (the final main course), specifically the interior of a rocket/spaceship area
- Near completion of all main courses: "Oh my God, dude, all the main courses will be finished. That will feel so good."
- Moving into polishing phase after main courses are complete: "After that, we can finally move on to polishing content. Polishing content is gonna feel so good after all this time."
- ROM currently at 58.8 megabytes, within N64 cartridge limits
- Planning extensive beta testing phase after Course 15 completion
- Overworld and side levels still need development work

## Personal Insights
- Shows satisfaction with visual effects and technical achievements: "Look at that BFX, dude. Look at that BFX. I love it."
- Philosophical about player engagement: "I've come to realize that it's very important to constantly edge the player."
- Selective about incorporating feedback: "at this point I think I have all the demo feedback I could ever need...a lot of the feedback I'm getting now is like either super nitpicky or contradicting another feedback I got"
- Strong opinions against excessive options menus: refuses to add difficulty modes or extensive customization options
- Expresses frustration with certain technical tools and emulators

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: No specific mentions in this transcript
- Biobak: Graphics artist providing ongoing feedback and model work, referenced multiple times as "Biobank"
- Zeina: Animator working on baby Yoshi animations: "Zayna's currently animating them. So hopefully they will be better once they are animated."
- Other Contributors: 
  - Hazer: Guest author creating a pastel-colored side level with wind sliding mechanics and flower aesthetics
  - Martiste: Another guest author mentioned for level work
  - Someone creating YouTube shorts for $5 each, making "mobile game ad" style content

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Major boss fight redesign from factory setting to planet-based arena where the boss destroys half a planet
- Changed boss design from tumors to mushrooms to reduce traumatic visual impact
- Swimming controls specifically adapted for small puddles rather than large water areas
- Critical BLJ (Backwards Long Jump) crash bug that needs fixing
- VFX improvements including upgraded rain effects and smoke systems
- Planning Mario 64 retro section with floating level segments from original game

## Business Aspects
- YouTube takes large cuts from donations, prefers PayPal but has alert issues
- Paying $5 per YouTube short to external creator
- Plans to open-source all content: "I will open-source all my stuff"
- No direct monetization strategy discussed beyond donations

## Key Quotes
- "Oh my God, dude, all the main courses will be finished. That will feel so good."
- "I've come to realize that it's very important to constantly edge the player. So that's what we're doing. We're going to edge the player with the star at the right start, right away."
- "at this point I think I have all the demo feedback I could ever need...I'm not sure if there's any demo feedback anymore that really does much to change my mind on anything"

## Potential Interview Topics
