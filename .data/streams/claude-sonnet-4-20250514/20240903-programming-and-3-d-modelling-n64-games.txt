## Game Development Process
- Performance optimization has achieved significant improvements: "we got FBDX3 working correctly now... it's basically like 50 FPS now. And I haven't even limited the drawing distance again"
- Current focus on Course 13 (ice/fridge level) with UV mapping and texturing work in progress
- Memory management challenges: "we are running out of memory for collision triangles... as soon as we make a collision map, that issue will go away"
- Near completion status: "we have 120 stars finished actually"
- Planned demo release: "I'm planning a demo of just Course 1, only the first level. So everyone can play with the new camera and the new Mario controls"
- Course 14 development anticipated: "I'm actually looking forward to course 14 so much. Course 14 has such a cool theme"

## Personal Insights
- Design philosophy prioritizes emotional impact: "when I'm doing visuals, I don't really think about it in terms of like pleasure to look at... For me, I think about it in first line about like emotions I want to invoke in the player. And I want this to feel cold and mysterious"
- Financial pressures affecting development: "now that I have a child, I need to make more money. So that means a lot more YouTube content. But it also means I might have to sell out a little bit"
- Thoughtful approach to level design: "Making a level I learned or at least for me is not just about sprinkling some purple or sprinkling some green or whatever... I need to think about purpose first"
- Balancing difficulty feedback: "I get a lot of people saying this is too difficult, and then I get a lot of people saying this is too easy"

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: No specific information mentioned in this transcript
- Biobak: Graphics artist who significantly improves Kaze's work - "Really at this point I have resigned myself to like knowing that whatever I do is just kind of like a suggestion for Biobank and he's gonna make it look a lot better"
- Zeina: Working on animations and outside area assets - "Zeina is making it right now. Or she's making assets for it [the outside area]"
- Other Contributors: Sauron (created FBDX3 microcode for performance optimization)

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Technical challenge with lighting system: "When I get close to an additional light source, the ambient light just disappears. I couldn't figure it out at all"
- Complex level architecture with multiple paths: "there's so many different ways to the castle" with secret pipes and interconnected areas
- Performance optimization through advanced microcode implementation (FBDX3)
- Memory management solutions through collision mapping
- Art direction focused on emotional atmosphere rather than pure aesthetics
- Implementation of room-based rendering system for performance

## Business Aspects
- Increased content production planned due to financial needs from having a child
- Multiple commissioned projects mentioned (GTA Mario 64 hack)
- Planned video content strategy including optimization tutorials and beta asset analysis
- Consideration of "selling out" for financial stability while maintaining artistic integrity

## Key Quotes
- "when I'm doing visuals, I don't really think about it in terms of like pleasure to look at. That's like secondary to me. For me, I think about it in first line about like emotions I want to invoke in the player"
- "Really at this point I have resigned myself to like knowing that whatever I do is just kind of like a suggestion for Biobank and he's gonna make it look a lot better"
- "now that I have a child, I need to make more money. So that means a lot more YouTube content. But it also means I might have to sell out a little bit, unfortunately"
