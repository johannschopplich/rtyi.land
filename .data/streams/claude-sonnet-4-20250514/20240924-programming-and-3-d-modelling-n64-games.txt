## Game Development Process
- Currently working on a complex paper/cardboard-themed level with 8,000 polygons (7,500 without text), which runs surprisingly well on N64 hardware
- Planning 15 main courses total for the complete game
- Game targets 60fps on emulator and 30fps on N64 hardware
- Source code will be made publicly available upon release
- Development involves multiple biomes within single levels (castle, Egypt area, etc.)
- Game will be released for free due to legal restrictions around ROM hacks

## Personal Insights
- Kaze shows concern about balancing community feedback with his creative vision: "I'm surprised people are saying the paper level looks good because on my last few videos, people seem to really dislike it"
- Strong commitment to maintaining Mario 64 authenticity: "We're also not adding anything that was invented after Nintendo 64 unless we invented it ourselves, basically"
- Focused on mechanical balance over visual appeal: "I think the spin jump is cool, but it's way too strong"
- Demonstrates iterative design philosophy, constantly refining mechanics based on playtesting

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: Composer working on dynamic music that changes based on which biome the player is in within levels
- Biobank: Graphics artist who has been swapping out enemy designs and working on visual assets
- Zeina: Animator currently working on cloud animations and other environmental elements
- Other Contributors: Leela/Lila appears to be contributing 3D models and textures for the project

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Major challenge with spin jump mechanic being overpowered: "The way it is right now, it is way too broken, like you can climb way too high with it"
- Struggling with meaningful Yoshi coin placement in levels that lack traditional NPCs for interactions
- Balancing the paper/cardboard aesthetic to be readable while maintaining the craft theme
- Creating enemies that fit the papercraft theme (developing thimble-based Shy Guys)
- Managing polygon counts and performance optimization for N64 hardware limitations

## Business Aspects
- Game will be completely free: "Yes, it will release for free. I never charge for my games. I wouldn't be allowed to"
- Cannot monetize due to legal restrictions around ROM hacking
- Hypothetically would consider cosmetic DLC model if legally possible: "Probably release the base game for free and then you could buy a skin or something"
- No mention of funding sources or marketing strategies

## Key Quotes
- "I think the spin jump is cool, but it's way too strong. Yeah I haven't run Excalibur yet Lila, definitely planned."
- "We're also not adding anything that was invented after Nintendo 64 unless we invented it ourselves, basically"
- "I'm surprised people are saying the paper level looks good because on my last few videos, people seem to really dislike it"
