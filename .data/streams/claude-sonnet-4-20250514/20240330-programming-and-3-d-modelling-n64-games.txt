## Game Development Process
- The project is in active development with specific feature completion lists, currently working on a Western-themed level with saloon doors, moving train elements, and chain chomps
- Memory constraints are a significant limiting factor: "We kind of have an issue with this level in that we're kind of out of memory. So I don't really want to add new characters if we can prevent that"
- The game includes anti-cheat measures with save state detection that triggers custom rap dialogue sequences
- Development is optimized for real N64 hardware compatibility, with RSP (Reality Signal Processor) bottlenecks being a primary concern
- The project uses a star-based progression system where visual elements change based on player progress (e.g., bartender's hat growing with each star collected)
- Course 14 is planned as a "space arcade" level, indicating substantial future content development

## Personal Insights
- Kaze values community feedback but maintains creative control: "There's always a good chance that I will just say, well, your criticism is stupid, I'll ignore it. But there's also a good chance that I'll seriously look at it and reconsider my decisions"
- He's critical of popular ROM hacks in the community, particularly Star Revenge, believing it's "overrated" within the hardcore community but would be poorly received by general audiences
- Strong stance against self-insertion in games: "I think self inserts is a little cringe"
- Demonstrates perfectionist tendencies, willing to restart and rework systems multiple times to achieve desired results
- Views the project as pushing technical and aesthetic boundaries while respecting the source material

## Collaborator Information
- **Biobak (Graphics Artist)**: Currently reworking course 11 textures with dramatic visual improvements. Kaze showcased before/after screenshots demonstrating Biobak's ability to add depth and weathering effects to container textures. "It's crazy. Looks so much better already. It looks like it has so much depth."
- **Zeina**: Working on texture creation, mentioned as "Zeno's making the textures." Limited information provided in this stream.
- **Badub**: No specific information about the composer found in this transcript.
- **Other Contributors**: 
  - Sauren: Working on F3DX optimization to reduce RSP load for better real hardware performance
  - Dan: Provides a voice channel for technical discussions
  - Community "shorts guy": Creates YouTube content for $270/year
  - Various community members providing level testing and feedback

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Audio system required complete reworking to implement pitch control for character voices, with Kaze stating: "I'm trying to make sound effects pitchable. Which was a functionality I had implemented before. But the way it was implemented was not that good"
- Door physics implementation proved extremely challenging, requiring multiple iterations and approach changes
- Memory allocation strategies needed optimization, particularly for moving wiggler and chain chomp objects to specific memory banks
- Balancing visual quality with N64 hardware limitations is an ongoing challenge
- Save state detection system implemented as creative anti-cheat measure using rap dialogue
- Level design philosophy focuses on natural progression rather than forced minigames: "there's no reason for us to even add the horseshoe thing, you know? Just let things happen naturally"

## Business Aspects
- Payment structure for collaborators includes providing hardware: discussion of buying a $1000 PC for a contributor and counting $800 as payment owed
- YouTube content creation generates revenue through a paid shorts creator ($270/year)
- No traditional funding or marketing strategies mentioned
- Community-driven development model with regular streaming as primary engagement method
- Real hardware compatibility suggests potential for physical release consideration

## Key Quotes
- "Every time you program something, you want it to be free of cost. If you're not using that part of codes." - Demonstrates optimization philosophy
- "I don't think coding style is very important, right? Yeah, I can see myself saying that IDEs make it pointless, because you can see the functions are yellow, the variables are blue. Like, what more do you need?" - Shows pragmatic approach to development
- "the vast majority of people do not rate it as highly. I Don't know if I can recall it overrated because of that" - Regarding community vs. mainstream game perception

## Potential Interview Topics
- The technical challenges of developing for original N64 hardware while pushing visual boundaries
- The collaborative process with artists and how creative decisions are made when balancing individual vision with community input
- The philosophy behind anti-cheat implementation and how it reflects broader game design principles
- Memory optimization strategies and how hardware constraints drive creative solutions
- The relationship between nostalgia and innovation in ROM hack development, particularly regarding community expectations vs. broader appeal
