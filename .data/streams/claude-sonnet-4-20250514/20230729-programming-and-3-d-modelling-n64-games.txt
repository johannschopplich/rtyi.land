## Game Development Process
- The game is nearing completion with 11 courses total: "This is the 11th course, we have like 10 of these already done" with "Four after this" remaining to complete
- Currently working on finishing the first star of the oil rig level: "We got the glass done, now we just need this guy done and the first star will be finished. Finally, after all this time"
- The game runs on actual N64 hardware: "So this runs on the real Nintendo 64, obviously this is an emulator, but this can run on a Nintendo 64"
- Development involves creating a Mario 64 sequel using optimized engine: "Yeah, this is basically a Mario 64 sequel...And this uses some super optimized engine that runs on the N64 that I made"

## Personal Insights
- Kaze has evolved his design philosophy since his previous project "Last Impact": "when i made last impact i was just like whenever i had an idea i would just put it in almost like unfiltered and i would definitely like think more about what actually is worth putting in...I should have been spending at least 20 of the time designing"
- He emphasizes the importance of intuitive game design: "I don't think kicking the oil barrel is intuitive and also that's not very funny...I think this mission would be better for trolls"
- Strong opinions on control schemes and game design: "I think controller plus mouse is the future" and "I completely dislike 2D games"
- Works professionally at Gears for Breakfast while developing this project: "Yeah, working at Gears is super chill"

## Collaborator Information
- Badub (Composer): Creating soundtrack for the oil rig level - "Badoop made a soundtrack for this level. It's not finished yet but he has some pretty good ideas." Also working on remixes: "he sent a second version of the yoshi's island night theme"
- Zeina (Animator): Actively working on character animations during the stream - "Zaina is not writing chats. She is working on her own stuff...I'm just helping out with animations. And anything else that he needs"
- Zero World: Contributing music for specific game sections - "zero world is making music right now for one of the 8-bit sections in this game"
- Other Contributors: Biobak is referenced (likely graphics), and various community members provide feedback and suggestions during development

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Technical constraints heavily influence design decisions, particularly polygon budget limitations: "God, he's like a thousand triangles now though...Can't waste my polygon budget like that"
- Level design focuses on player interactions with NPCs: designing a level "where you just mess with Bowser's minions. You destroy their plans to like build Bowser's base here"
- Balancing comedy and intuitiveness in gameplay mechanics: rejecting oil barrel mechanics because "it's just so cryptic to just kick over the random oil barrel. Who would think to do that?"
- N64 hardware limitations affecting visual features: "This level does not have the performance left over from manual hard shadows"

## Business Aspects
- Recently completed "Only Up 64" game releasing the next day: "I finished making only up 64 it's releasing tomorrow"
- Submission to F3 competition with financial incentives: "f3 is in two weeks the submission deadline ends tomorrow...someone was gonna just give you money"
- Receives free hardware from manufacturers for testing: "I often get emails from like Chinese manufacturers...I got a monitor I got like a capture card I'm getting new speakers right now"

## Key Quotes

- "We got the glass done, now we just need this guy done and the first star will be finished. Finally, after all this time. I am excited for that."
- "So this runs on the real Nintendo 64, obviously this is an emulator, but this can run on a Nintendo 64...And this uses some super optimized engine that runs on the N64 that I made"
