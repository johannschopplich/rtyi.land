## Game Development Process
- Currently working on course 11 of overworld 3, with the Bowser fight essentially complete except for animations, SFX, and VFX
- Originally planned 15 courses but reconsidering because "a lot of the courses kinda suck," leading to new brainstorming sessions
- Design document is growing large, indicating substantial planning and documentation
- Development philosophy emphasizes generating multiple options: "come up with 15 ideas and use 5 of them" rather than settling for limited choices
- Performance optimization has been highly successful - the game now runs so well on N64 that frame rates can't drop below 30 FPS even in widescreen mode
- Planning 15 retro levels based on older Mario games, with each game getting only one retro course

## Personal Insights
- Kaze emphasizes that decision-making is more critical than technical execution: "Making decisions is like the most important thing of making a game. No matter how hard you work, if you don't make good decisions, your game's gonna be shit"
- Strong belief in quality curation over accepting mediocre ideas due to limited options
- Preference for games that are "complex but easy to understand," avoiding overly abstract concepts
- Values community engagement but maintains creative control over design decisions
- Switched from Twitch to YouTube streaming due to excessive advertising, showing concern for viewer experience
- Expresses desire to create good games without monetization barriers: "I don't want people do have to pay or watch ads for games. I just want to make good games"

## Collaborator Information
- Zeno: Animator responsible for creating animations for the Bowser fight sequence; development is waiting on their work before implementing SFX and VFX
- Badoo: Composer mentioned in context of organizing the music level development
- Biobank: Graphics artist; Kaze acknowledges their workload and refuses to request excessive unpaid labor ("I'm not just gonna ask biobank. Hey, just do like 200 hours of unpaid labor from you, please")
- Other Contributors: Active community providing level theme suggestions during the stream, though not official team members

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Developing a dual-world mechanic using mirrors to switch between normal and haunted/dark versions of levels, inspired by games like Tiny Huge Island
- Extensive brainstorming for level themes including Wild West Valley (with detective/outlaw-catching mechanics), Frantic Fleet Factory (Bowser's airship construction sabotage), comic book superhero world, casino level, and music level
- Balancing theme diversity while avoiding repetition from previous game "Lost Impact"
- Detailed planning for Frantic Fleet Factory including specific missions: sabotaging workers, causing strikes, defeating strike-breakers, and post-destruction scenarios
- Assigning retro game themes to each level (Dr. Mario, Mario Paint, Paper Mario, etc.) with specific platforming adaptations

## Business Aspects
- No direct monetization strategy mentioned for the game itself
- Platform switching from Twitch to YouTube due to advertising concerns and creator revenue splits (mentions platforms taking "over 50% cut")
- Focus on accessibility over profit, emphasizing free game distribution
- Community-driven development approach with public streaming and feedback integration

## Key Quotes
- "Making decisions is like the most important thing of making a game. No matter how hard you work, if you don't make good decisions, your game's gonna be shit. So us taking the time to make the best decisions for what the level theme should be is very valuable to the final game."
- "See, the way I see designing a game to be, you should come up with 15 ideas and use 5 of them. Right now we have 4 ideas and we need to use 5. So we're really behind."
- "I don't want people do have to pay or watch ads for games. I just want to make good games."
