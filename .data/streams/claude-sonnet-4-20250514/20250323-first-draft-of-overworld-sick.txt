## Game Development Process
- Project is approximately 10% complete according to Kaze's estimate
- Currently working on overworld design, specifically "part 5" of the hub world
- The original overworld has been completely scrapped and rebuilt due to quality standards not meeting expectations
- ROM file size is just under 60MB, featuring a massive new overworld that functions as a single level
- ESA (a collaborator) is actively working on level development
- Multiple course entrances are being strategically planned throughout the overworld (parts 6, 7, 8, 9, 12 mentioned)
- The game features a completely rebuilt engine with improvements over vanilla Mario 64

## Personal Insights
- Kaze expresses frustration with modern game development trends, advocating for more creative, risky games rather than "safe" commercial products
- Shows dedication to quality over speed, willing to completely restart major components if they don't meet standards
- Demonstrates technical expertise while acknowledging limitations outside his specialty areas
- Reveals personal investment in the project as a creative expression, comparing it to innovative games like the original Yoshi's Island
- Shows concern about maintaining authenticity and avoiding becoming "the lamest dad at school" if his daughter doesn't appreciate his work

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: No relevant information found in this transcript
- Biobak: No relevant information found in this transcript  
- Zeina: Created drawings/concept art for the game, though Kaze notes some designs "don't really work" for certain areas; also mentioned in relation to a "wasabi song" Kaze invented
- Other Contributors: ESA is actively working on level development; Roman mentioned as a cautionary tale of failed project (Super Mario Galaxy 64) from seven years ago

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Complete overworld redesign due to original not meeting quality standards
- Implementation of a new step function that eliminates invisible wall glitches common in vanilla Mario 64
- Design philosophy focused on making players feel "there's secrets around every corner"
- Multiplayer implementation being considered but faces challenges, particularly with boss fight mechanics
- Strategic placement of course entrances and secret passages to create interconnected world design
- Technical constraints requiring optimization due to N64 hardware limitations, though noting the original Mario 64 engine was poorly optimized

## Business Aspects
- Multiple sponsors secured requiring video content creation (NordVPN, Squarespace, Brilliant mentioned)
- Legal concerns prevent physical cartridge distribution due to Nintendo IP
- Plans to release the game online through YouTube channel rather than traditional distribution
- Revenue generation through sponsorships to "make money for my family"
- Acknowledgment that Nintendo could potentially take down the project, with backup plans for retheming if necessary

## Key Quotes
- "The original overworld is completely erased. It's just not up to the quality standards. Yeah, it's the new overworld for Return to Yoshi's Island."
- "Let's start making based games again simpler games not just the Hey, let's throw six million dollars at it and make something very safe that is guaranteed to not be garbage type games We'd be making risky games again"
- "I want the whole island to feel like there's secrets around every corner after all."

## Potential Interview Topics
- The decision-making process behind completely scrapping and rebuilding the original overworld - what specific quality standards weren't being met?
- Technical innovations in the engine compared to vanilla Mario 64 and how these improvements enhance gameplay
- Balancing creative vision with legal limitations when working with Nintendo IP
- The role of community collaboration and how contributors like ESA and Zeina fit into the development workflow
- Philosophy on modern game development practices and the push for more innovative, risky game design approaches
