## Game Development Process
- Currently working on course 13 out of 15 total levels, with 120 out of 180 stars completed
- Game features 98 original songs (compared to Mario Odyssey's 82), with about 30% of enemies implemented
- Development follows a "done when it's done" philosophy, prioritizing quality over meeting deadlines
- Uses Mario 64 decompilation as base, with custom tools like Fast64 for Blender integration
- Scope comparison suggests content comparable to or exceeding Mario Odyssey when accounting for different collectible types

## Personal Insights
- Strong belief that Mario 64's core identity is "freedom and exploration" and that artificial difficulty contradicts this philosophy
- Views his game's objectives as more meaningful than typical collectathons: "the objective itself, like exploring what the objective is, is part of the fun"
- Committed to not releasing unfinished products, explicitly referencing criticism of EA's practices
- Believes players should create their own difficulty through risk-taking rather than forced challenging mechanics
- Shows perfectionist tendencies, often reworking areas that initially look poor until they meet his standards

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub (Composer)**: Primary music composer, described as bringing "great creativity"; works with M64 MIDI-like format and some streamed audio; created Ice Castle/Ice Dungeon themes
- **Biobak (Graphics Artist)**: Contributes visual design concepts, sent video references for boss fight ideas
- **Zeina (Animator)**: Handles animation work; appears to be in a personal relationship with Kaze based on context clues about shared domestic responsibilities
- **Other Contributors**: Arthur (programmer with planetary gravity code), Dot Star Money (music conversion tools), various community members providing real-time feedback during streams

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Currently designing complex Raphael the Raven boss fight featuring moon mechanics, falling into space, and cheese ninja star projectiles
- Technical constraint philosophy: "we need to make sure that the things we add can be done entirely on an actor level" to avoid system-wide changes
- Balances visual spectacle with technical feasibility, often choosing simpler implementations that maintain the desired effect
- Addresses camera and rendering issues (fog problems, material bleeding bugs in Fast64)
- Incorporates community suggestions while maintaining overall creative vision
- Designs with consideration for different controller types (GameCube controller compatibility)

## Business Aspects
- No monetization strategy or business model discussed
- No set release date or marketing timeline mentioned
- Operates as passion project with community-driven development approach
- No mention of funding, publishers, or commercial distribution plans

## Key Quotes
- "Mario 64 is about freedom and exploration. Being directed to that heavily would, I think, ruin a lot of it."
- "I can't release it before it's finished, unfortunately. Because then I would release an unfinished product. The thing that everybody hates EA for."
- "The fun is to control Mario itself. Whereas in this, it's like the objective itself, like exploring what the objective is, is part of the fun."

## Potential Interview Topics
- The philosophical approach to preserving Mario 64's core identity while innovating on the formula
- The collaborative process with Badub on creating a 98-song original soundtrack and how music drives level design
- Technical innovations and creative solutions for working within N64 hardware limitations
- The decision-making process for scope and feature inclusion, particularly the balance between ambition and feasibility
- Community involvement in development and how real-time feedback shapes design decisions during live streams
