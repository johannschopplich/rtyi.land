## Game Development Process
- The project is approximately two-thirds complete after nearly three years of development, with an estimated 1.5+ years remaining until release
- Currently in a "polishing phase" where the team is refining older areas that are smaller than newer retro areas 
- 115 stars have been completed so far out of the total planned content
- The team is working on the third overworld, specifically developing an oil rig level with multiple missions and boss fights
- Engine improvements have been made including updated fog systems, lighting, and camera collision detection

## Personal Insights
- Kaze expresses concern about level scale and player experience: "the overworld feels so small to me now I don't like that"
- Strong design philosophy favoring traditional Mario 64 mechanics: "I want the player to control Mario and not a crane... I think that often leads to poor romex So I want to avoid that"
- Acknowledges motivation challenges in long-term development: "how do you stay motivated i'm not motivated at all so you need to work without motivation"
- Has a full-time programming job at "gears for breakfast" working in Unreal Engine, limiting development time on the ROM hack
- Views the project as both hobby and business due to generating revenue

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: Composer working on Bowser animations and considering moving to NPC work. Kaze indicates satisfaction with current animation progress.
- Biobak: Graphics artist who reviews and refines Kaze's models, significantly improving visual quality. Described as making models "a lot prettier" through his review process.
- Zeina (Lila): Animator present during development streams, contributes to design discussions and appears to work on character animations. Referred to as Kaze's wife during the stream.
- Other Contributors: No additional major contributors mentioned in this transcript.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Developing an oil-themed boss fight using a "gargantua block" made of oil, with mechanics involving soap bars and cleaning gameplay
- Addressing level scale concerns by adding underground areas connected through multiple entrances to make levels feel more substantial
- Balancing performance optimization (triangle count management) with visual detail in level design
- Maintaining authentic Mario 64 gameplay while introducing new mechanics and themes
- Creating cohesive level progression with red coins, missions, and exploration elements

## Business Aspects
- Revenue generated through YouTube ad revenue from development streams and content
- Plans to open-source the project after release but not before to prevent spoilers and potential Nintendo issues
- Previous conflicts with Nintendo have been resolved: "Last time they took me down, I told them to fuck off, basically, and they did fuck off"
- No hardware modifications required - the game runs on standard N64 without overclocking
- Acknowledges potential speedrunning community challenges due to different physics affecting Mario 64 muscle memory

## Key Quotes
- "we are only two-thirds through the game and it's been like almost three years now... realistically it's still gonna be at least like a year and a half tomorrow"
- "I want the player to control Mario and not a crane... I think that often leads to poor romex So I want to avoid that"
- "how do you stay motivated i'm not motivated at all so you need to work without motivation... just work it's not that hard you're physically capable of working so why aren't you"

## Potential Interview Topics
- The evolution of team collaboration methods and how responsibilities are divided among contributors
- Balancing full-time employment with passion project development and managing long-term motivation
- Technical challenges of working with Mario 64 decompilation versus traditional ROM hacking approaches
- The decision-making process for maintaining authentic Mario 64 feel while introducing new gameplay mechanics
- Experiences with Nintendo's enforcement actions and strategies for protecting fan projects
