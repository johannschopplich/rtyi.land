## Game Development Process
- Currently working on one of the final levels - only two areas missing for completion of the current level (underground oil rig section)
- Implementing multiple entrance system connecting underground areas through platforming sections
- Technical optimizations mentioned: custom decompression that takes longer than Mario 64's artificial 16-frame delay, allowing 8-frame waits instead
- Project appears to be in late-stage development with Kaze stating "I'm almost done with the game, too"
- Working within strict N64 hardware limitations: 150 polygon limit for geometry, 64x64 texture constraints

## Personal Insights
- Kaze expresses confidence in the project's technical achievements: "look with all this optimization artists have so much more freedom and we brought more artists on board which is you and now the game is epic and amazing because we all these optimizations"
- Shows awareness of ROM hack criticism regarding difficulty: "usually when you make a romhack the criticism is always it's too difficult so i've gotten very wary of difficult i have been trying to make my games easier and easier"
- Demonstrates pride in YouTube channel growth: "every video is doing better than the previous one that's actually crazy my youtube channel is on an upwards draft"
- Values technical innovation over traditional game elements, focusing on optimization and engine capabilities

## Collaborator Information
- Yoshi Milkman: Sound designer who created comprehensive surface sounds for different materials (wood, steel, glass, leaves, squishy surfaces, metal grates) - "he put a lot of work into making this perfect"
- Duke: Composer who "made a song for it" and is "also making a song for the oil bus"
- Zeina: Animator working on the project, mentioned as collaborating on level design and going out with Kaze
- Biobak: Graphics artist referenced in context of post-production work and design justification
- Other Contributors: Multiple community members offering freelance work and asset creation during the stream

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Balancing difficulty for late-game content (Course 11) while making it accessible: debating jump difficulty and providing multiple solution paths
- Managing technical constraints while maintaining visual quality: choosing appropriate textures within 64x64 limitations
- Level design philosophy of providing multiple approaches: "you can just long jump. And you can just double jump. And if you want, you can even just backflip and wallkick"
- Creating thematic coherence for underground oil rig environment while working within hardware limitations
- Implementing connected underground area system with multiple entrance points for complex level navigation

## Business Aspects
- YouTube channel performance tracking and growth strategy, with videos performing progressively better
- Mentions sponsor revenue (Brilliant sponsorship paying $1300 per video)
- Plans for promotional content: "I'm also gonna make a video on the all-alone bubble don't remix soon"
- No direct mention of game monetization, release pricing, or distribution plans found

## Key Quotes
- "look with all this optimization artists have so much more freedom and we brought more artists on board which is you and now the game is epic and amazing because we all these optimizations" - Shows pride in technical achievements enabling artistic freedom
- "I'm almost done with the game, too" - Indicates project is in final stages of development
- "usually when you make a romhack the criticism is always it's too difficult so i've gotten very wary of difficult i have been trying to make my games easier and easier" - Reveals design philosophy evolution based on community feedback

## Potential Interview Topics
- The technical optimization process and how it enabled expanded artistic collaboration
- Evolution of design philosophy regarding difficulty balancing in ROM hacks
- The collaborative workflow between Kaze and the audio/visual artists (Yoshi Milkman, Zeina, Biobak)
- Challenges of working within N64 hardware constraints while pushing technical boundaries
- The relationship between YouTube content creation and game development as parallel creative processes
