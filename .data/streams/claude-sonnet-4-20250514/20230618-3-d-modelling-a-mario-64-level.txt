## Game Development Process
- The project is well advanced with 11 out of 15 levels completed ("It is course 11 out of 15 So 11 means we are already pretty far")
- Currently working on "Oily Boily Bay" level with wind turbine mechanics and red coin missions
- Game size is carefully managed at 42.8 megabytes within the 64 megabyte N64 limitation
- Most main areas are done with modeling, transitioning to programming phase
- Planning to finish red coin mission implementation by next week, then move to level programming
- Significant performance optimizations achieved (zoo level went from 9 FPS to 40-50 FPS)

## Personal Insights
- Kaze has strong opinions about game design philosophy, particularly opposing excessive player options: "I actually think games are better if you have less options, but the options that are there are satisfactory"
- Expresses frustration with community requests for cosmetic options rather than meaningful gameplay choices
- Reveals modest setup with old equipment ("I haven't had a new microphone in like three or four years")
- Shows pragmatic approach to spending: "I hate buying stuff. I like having money"
- Transitioning from Twitch to YouTube streaming due to platform concerns
- Balances accessibility concerns while maintaining challenging gameplay design

- Other Contributors: 
  - Lila: Provides feedback on camera work and visual elements, mentioned giving input on cutouts and visual quality
  - Community members providing real-time feedback through chat during development

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- Implementing wind turbine mechanics with timing elements for platforming puzzles
- Overcoming technical gimbal lock issues when rotating 3D models
- Balancing final level difficulty while considering casual players: "Having a super hard final level is only really reasonable if There's a lot of content that like all the stupid casual players are not gonna attack"
- Red coin placement strategy to create intuitive but challenging platforming sequences
- Maintaining performance within N64 hardware limitations while maximizing visual quality
- Developing modular level design systems that allow improvisation during development

## Business Aspects
- Plans to release source code when complete, with potential backport to original N64 hardware
- Strategic move from Twitch to YouTube streaming platform
- Securing conference speaking engagement about N64 reverse engineering
- Monitoring video performance metrics and adapting content strategy for YouTube algorithm
- No direct monetization or funding discussions mentioned

## Key Quotes
- "I literally don't even think it's crazy to say anymore that this looks like a GameCube game" - Reflecting on the visual achievements within N64 constraints
- "People are asking for options on every little detail... Which very clearly should not be an option. Like at that point, just make your own game" - Philosophy on player customization
- "By next week we'll probably finish the red coin mission. And then we can start programming the level. Which will be very, very fun" - Enthusiasm for upcoming development milestones

## Potential Interview Topics
- The philosophy behind balancing accessibility and challenge in ROM hack development
- Technical innovations and optimizations that push N64 hardware beyond original capabilities
- The evolution from solo development to community-driven feedback integration
- Decision-making process for maintaining authenticity while introducing modern game design elements
- The role of streaming and community engagement in the iterative development process
