## Game Development Process
- The project is in active optimization phase, with Arctic's tools helping save 1.7 megabytes of ROM space through music streaming improvements
- Development targets 60 FPS performance on original N64 hardware, requiring careful optimization of graphics and effects
- Multiple star select screens are being implemented with custom animations and effects
- The team is working within strict N64 hardware limitations, particularly coordinate system constraints that can cause crashes if exceeded
- ROM size management is an ongoing concern, with careful consideration of what content can be included

## Personal Insights
- Kaze recently got a new job as a 3D modeler for a government-related position and is moving to a new house
- Struggles with project funding - YouTube revenue was only $6.90 last month, supplemented by small Patreon income
- Maintains strong commitment to quality and scope management, rejecting features that don't fit the game's vision
- Expresses desire to compensate collaborators despite financial constraints
- Shows frustration with technical limitations but persistent problem-solving approach

## Collaborator Information
- Biobank: Primary graphics artist creating star select screens, 3D models (including minecart animations), and level assets like crystal cave backgrounds. Jokingly mentions charging "$5 per vertex" and references being "starving," highlighting the unpaid nature of the work
- Arctic: Develops music tools, particularly strm64, which enabled significant ROM space savings by optimizing music streaming and removing unnecessary loop extensions
- Other Contributors: Chat community provides ongoing feedback and suggestions during development streams

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- N64 coordinate system imposes strict limits - objects beyond ~33,000 coordinates cause crashes, requiring careful scene composition
- Lighting implementation challenges, particularly with crystal effects that could interfere with overall scene lighting
- Balancing visual appeal with performance constraints to maintain 60 FPS target
- Fog and transparency effects require careful optimization to avoid performance issues
- Scope management to prevent feature creep, with Kaze rejecting ideas like racing simulators that don't fit the core vision

## Business Aspects
- Severe revenue constraints with YouTube generating minimal income ($6.90/month)
- Plans to eventually pay collaborators and license music properly once funding allows
- Patreon provides supplemental income but still insufficient for proper compensation
- No clear monetization strategy or release timeline discussed
- Community-driven development model with unpaid contributors working on passion

## Key Quotes
- "my YouTube channel last month, $6.90 and a little bit on Patreon I definitely cannot pay him enough to buy all his groceries But I can definitely give you some of that for all the help"
- "Arctic realized yesterday that his tool strm 64 has some cool properties that allow us to save 1.7 megabytes of ROM space"
- "If you render any object out of this range your n64 is just gonna crash"

## Potential Interview Topics
- The financial sustainability of passion projects and ethical considerations around unpaid collaboration
- Technical innovation within severe hardware constraints and how limitations drive creativity
- Community-driven development models and the role of live streaming in game development
- The transition from hobby project to potential commercial release and associated challenges
- Balancing artistic vision with practical limitations in ROM hacking and game development
