He identifies that unlocking Part 10 currently opens too many destinations at once (11–15) and iterates on solutions: a new “overworld event” system, NPC-style blockers (Yoshi’s Island message/yap blocks), and a Kamek-triggered overworld boss/event to remove barriers. In parallel, he brainstorms optional ‘secret’ overworld content (windmill back entrance; Boobla infestation; a friendly Bone Dragon puzzle/ally that can become an elevator into a rising-lava secret area) and discusses a future pause-menu world map with an unfolding/unrolling animation. He also flags the need for structured beta testing and briefly wrestles with an unexpected collision/area bug related to collision complexity/triangle counts.",
