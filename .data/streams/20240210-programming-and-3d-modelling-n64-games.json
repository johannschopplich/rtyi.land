Mid-stream he reveals a major engine change: replacing SM64’s collision with a new custom collision system for stability (with side effects like BLJ being harder/less common). He also discusses design philosophy (how he interprets player criticism), gives a concrete remaining-scope estimate (~80% complete), and briefly talks business plans post-release (Kickstarter for an original 3D platformer and hiring ROM hackers).",
